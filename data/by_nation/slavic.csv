98,slavic,Snowflake,"Once upon a time there lived a peasant called Ivan, and he had a wife whose name was Marie. They would have been quite happy except for one thing: they had no children to play with, and as they were now old people they did not find that watching the children of their neighbours at all made up to them for having one of their own.One winter, which nobody living will ever forget, the snow lay so deep that it came up to the knees of even the tallest man. When it had all fallen, and the sun was shining again, the children ran out into the street to play, and the old man and his wife sat at their window and gazed at them. The children first made a sort of little terrace, and stamped it hard and firm, and then they began to make a snow woman. Ivan and Marie watched them, the while thinking about many things.Suddenly Ivan’s face brightened, and, looking at his wife, he said, ‘Wife, why shouldn’t we make a snow woman too?’‘Why not?’ replied Marie, who happened to be in a very good temper; ‘it might amuse us a little. But there is no use making a woman. Let us make a little snow child, and pretend it is a living one.’‘Yes, let us do that,’ said Ivan, and he took down his cap and went into the garden with his old wife.Then the two set to work with all their might to make a doll out of the snow. They shaped a little body and two little hands and two little feet. On top of all they placed a ball of snow, out of which the head was to be.‘What in the world are you doing?’ asked a passer-by.‘Can’t you guess?’ returned Ivan.‘Making a snow-child,’ replied Marie.They had finished the nose and the chin. Two holes were left for the eyes, and Ivan carefully shaped out the mouth. No sooner had he done so than he felt a warm breath upon his cheek. He started back in surprise and looked–and behold! the eyes of the child met his, and its lips, which were as red as raspberries, smiled at him!‘What is it?’ cried Ivan, crossing himself. ‘Am I mad, or is the thing bewitched?’The snow-child bent its head as if it had been really alive. It moved its little arms and its little legs in the snow that lay about it just as the living children did theirs.‘Ah! Ivan, Ivan,’ exclaimed Marie, trembling with joy, ‘heaven has sent us a child at last!’ And she threw herself upon Snowflake (for that was the snow-child’s name) and covered her with kisses. And the loose snow fell away from Snowflake as an egg shell does from an egg, and it was a little girl whom Marie held in her arms.‘Oh! my darling Snowflake!’ cried the old woman, and led her into the cottage.And Snowflake grew fast; each hour as well as each day made a difference, and every day she became more and more beautiful. The old couple hardly knew how to contain themselves for joy, and thought of nothing else. The cottage was always full of village children, for they amused Snowflake, and there was nothing in the world they would not have done to amuse her. She was their doll, and they were continually inventing new dresses for her, and teaching her songs or playing with her. Nobody knew how clever she was! She noticed everything, and could learn a lesson in a moment. Anyone would have taken her for thirteen at least! And, besides all that, she was so good and obedient; and so pretty, too! Her skin was as white as snow, her eyes as blue as forget-me-nots, and her hair was long and golden. Only her cheeks had no colour in them, but were as fair as her forehead.So the winter went on, till at last the spring sun mounted higher in the heavens and began to warm the earth. The grass grew green in the fields, and high in the air the larks were heard singing. The village girls met and danced in a ring, singing, ‘Beautiful spring, how came you here? How came you here? Did you come on a plough, or was it a harrow?’ Only Snowflake sat quite still by the window of the cottage.‘What is the matter, dear child?’ asked Marie. ‘Why are you so sad? Are you ill? or have they treated you unkindly?’‘No,’ replied Snowflake, ‘it is nothing, mother; no one has hurt me; I am well.’The spring sun had chased away the last snow from its hiding place under the hedges; the fields were full of flowers; nightingales sang in the trees, and all the world was gay. But the gayer grew the birds and the flowers the sadder became Snowflake. She hid herself from her playmates, and curled herself up where the shadows were deepest, like a lily amongst its leaves. Her only pleasure was to lie amid the green willows near some sparkling stream. At the dawn and at twilight only she seemed happy. When a great storm broke, and the earth was white with hail, she became bright and joyous as the Snowflake of old; but when the clouds passed, and the hail melted beneath the sun, Snowflake would burst into tears and weep as a sister would weep over her brother.The spring passed, and it was the eve of St. John, or Midsummer Day. This was the greatest holiday of the year, when the young girls met in the woods to dance and play. They went to fetch Snowflake, and said to Marie: ‘Let her come and dance with us.’But Marie was afraid; she could not tell why, only she could not bear the child to go. Snowflake did not wish to go either, but they had no excuse ready. So Marie kissed the girl and said: ‘Go, my Snowflake, and be happy with your friends, and you, dear children, be careful of her. You know she is the light of my eyes to me.’‘Oh, we will take care of her,’ cried the girls gaily, and they ran off to the woods. There they wore wreaths, gathered nosegays, and sang songs some sad, some merry. And whatever they did Snowflake did too.When the sun set they lit a fire of dry grass, and placed themselves in a row, Snowflake being the last of all. ‘Now, watch us,’ they said, ‘and run just as we do.’And they all began to sing and to jump one after another across the fire.Suddenly, close behind them, they heard a sigh, then a groan. ‘Ah!’ They turned hastily and looked at each other. There was nothing. They looked again. Where was Snowflake? She has hidden herself for fun, they thought, and searched for her everywhere. ‘Snowflake! Snowflake!’ But there was no answer. ‘Where can she be? Oh, she must have gone home.’ They returned to the village, but there was no Snowflake.For days after that they sought her high and low. They examined every bush and every hedge, but there was no Snowflake. And long after everyone else had given up hope Ivan and Marie would wander through the woods crying ‘Snowflake, my dove, come back, come back!’ And sometimes they thought they heard a call, but it was never the voice of Snowflake.And what had become of her? Had a fierce wild beast seized her and dragged her into his lair in the forest? Had some bird carried her off across the wide blue sea?No, no beast had touched her, no bird had borne her away. With the first breath of flame that swept over her when she ran with her friends Snowflake had melted away, and a little soft haze floating upwards was all that remained of her.","['upon', 'time',

169,slavic,The Spirit of the Steppes,"In ancient days there lived a king and queen; the former was old but the latter young. Although they loved one another dearly they were very unhappy, for God had not given them any children. They fretted and grieved about this so deeply that the queen became ill with melancholy. The doctors advised her to travel. The king was obliged to remain at home, so she went without him, accompanied by twelve maids of honour, all beautiful and fresh as flowers in May. When they had travelled for some days, they reached a vast uninhabited plain which stretched so far away it seemed to touch the sky. After driving hither and thither for some time the driver was quite bewildered, and stopped before a large stone column. At its foot stood a warrior on horseback, clad in steel armour.“Brave knight, can you direct me to the high-road?” said the driver; “we are lost, and know not which way to go.”“I will show you the way,” said the warrior, “but only on one condition, that each of you gives me a kiss.”The queen looked at the warrior in wrath, and ordered the coachman to drive on. The carriage continued moving nearly all day, but as if bewitched, for it always returned to the stone column. This time the queen addressed the warrior.“Knight,” said she, “show us the road, and I will reward you richly.”“I am the Master Spirit of the Steppes,” answered he. “I demand payment for showing the way, and my payment is always in kisses.”“Very well, my twelve maids of honour shall pay you.”“Thirteen kisses are due to me; the first must be given by the lady who addresses me.”The queen was very angry, and again the attempt was made to find their way. But the carriage, though during the whole time it moved in an opposite direction, still returned to the stone column. It was now dark, and they were obliged to think of finding shelter for the night, so the queen was obliged to give the warrior his strange payment. Getting out of her carriage she walked up to the knight, and looking modestly down allowed him to kiss her; her twelve maids of honour who followed did the same. A moment later stone column and horseman had vanished, and they found themselves on the high-road, while a perfumed cloud seemed to float over the steppes. The queen stepped into her carriage with her ladies, and so the journey was continued.But from that day the beautiful queen and her maids became thoughtful and sad; and, losing all pleasure in travel, went back to the capital. Yet the return home did not make the queen happy, for always before her eyes she saw the Horseman of the Steppes. This displeased the king, who became gloomy and ill-tempered.One day while the king was on his throne in the council chamber he suddenly heard the sweetest warblings, like unto those produced by a bird of paradise; these were answered by the songs of many nightingales. Wondering, he sent to find out what it was. The messenger returned saying that the queen and her twelve maids of honour had each been presented with a girl baby, and that the sweet warblings were but the crying of the children. The king was greatly astonished, and while he was engaged in deep thought about the matter the palace was suddenly lit up by lights of dazzling brightness. On inquiring into the cause he learnt that the little princess had opened her eyes, and that they shone with matchless brilliancy.At first the king could not speak, so amazed was he. He laughed and he cried, he sorrowed and he rejoiced, and in the midst of it all a deputation of ministers and senators was announced. When these were shown into his presence they fell on their knees, and striking the ground with their foreheads, said, “Sire, save your people and your royal person. The queen and her twelve maids of honour have been presented by the Spirit of the Steppes with thirteen girl babies. We beseech you to have these children killed, or we shall all be destroyed.”The king, roused to anger, gave orders that all the babies should be thrown into the sea. The courtiers were already on their way to obey this cruel command when the queen entered, weeping, and pale as death. She threw herself at the king’s feet and begged him to spare the lives of these helpless and innocent children, and instead to let them be placed on a desert island and there left in the hands of God.The king granted her wish. The baby princess was placed in a golden cradle, her little companions in copper cradles, and the thirteen were taken to a desert island and left quite alone. Every one at court thought that they had perished, and said one to another, “They will die from cold and hunger; they will be devoured by wild beasts, or birds of prey; they are sure to die; perchance they will be buried under dead leaves or covered with snow.” But happily nothing of the kind happened, for God takes care of little children.The small princess grew bigger day by day. Every morning she was awakened by the rising sun, and bathed by the dew. Soft breezes refreshed her, and twisted into plaits her luxuriant hair. The trees sang her to sleep with their rustling lullabies, the stars watched over her at night. The swans clothed her in their soft raiment, and the bees fed her with their honey. The beauty of the little maiden increased with her growth. Her brow was calm and pure as the moon, her lips red as a rosebud, and so eloquent that her voice sounded like a shower of pearls. But wonderful beyond compare was the expressive beauty of her eyes, for if she looked at you kindly you seemed to float in a sea of joy, if angrily it made you numb with fear, and you were instantly changed into a block of ice. She was waited upon by her twelve companions, who were almost as charming as their mistress, to whom they were devotedly attached. Rumours of the loveliness of Princess Sudolisu spread far and wide. People came to see her from all parts of the world, so that it was soon no longer a desert island, but a thickly populated and magnificent city.Many a prince came from afar and entered the lists as suitor for the hand of Sudolisu, but none succeeded in winning her love. Those who bore with good temper and resignation the disappointment of being refused returned home safe and sound, but woe to the unlucky wretch who rebelled against her will and attempted to use an armed force; his soldiers perished miserably, while he, frozen to the heart by her angry glance, was turned into a block of ice.Now it happened that the famous ogre, Kostey, who lived underground, was a great admirer of beauty. And he took it into his head to see what the creatures above ground were doing. By the help of his telescope he was able to observe all the kings and queens, princes and princesses, gentlemen and ladies, living on the earth. As he was looking his eye fell upon a beautiful island, where, bright as many stars, stood twelve maidens; while in their midst, upon a couch of swan’s-down, slept a young princess lovely as the dawn of day. Sudolisu was dreaming of a young knight who rode a spirited horse; on his breast was a golden cuirass, and in his hand an invisible club. And in her dream she admired this knight, and loved him more than life itself. The wicked Kostey longed to have her for his own, and determined to carry her off. He reached the earth by striking it from underground three times with his forehead. The princess called her army together, and putting herself at its head, led her soldiers against him. But he merely breathed upon the soldiers and they fell down in an overpowering sleep. Then he stretched out his bony hands to take the princess, but she, throwing a glance full of anger and disdain at him, changed him into a block of ice. Then she shut herself up in her palace. Kostey did not remain frozen long; when the princess had departed he came to life again, and started off in pursuit of her. On reaching the town where she dwelt, he put all the inhabitants into a charmed sleep, and laid the same spell upon the twelve maids of honour. Fearing the power of her eyes, he dared not attack Sudolisu herself; so he surrounded her palace with an iron wall, and left it in charge of a monster dragon with twelve heads. Then he waited, in hope that the princess would give in.Days passed, weeks grew into months, and still Princess Sudolisu’s kingdom looked like one large bedchamber. The people snored in the streets, the brave army lying in the fields slept soundly, hidden in the long grass under the shadow of nettle, wormwood, and thistle, rust and dust marring the brightness of their armour. Inside the palace everything was the same. The twelve maids of honour lay motionless. The princess alone kept watch, silent amid this reign of sleep. She walked up and down her narrow prison, sighing and weeping bitter tears, but no other sound broke the silence; only Kostey, avoiding her glance, still called through the doors and begged her to refuse him no longer. Then he promised she should be Queen of the Nether World, but she answered him not.Lonely and miserable, she thought of the prince of her dreams. She saw him in his golden armour, mounted on his spirited steed, looking at her with eyes full of love. So she imagined him day and night.Looking out of window one day, and seeing a cloud floating on the horizon, she cried:“Floating Cloudlet soft and white,Pilgrim of the sky,I pray you for one moment, lightOn me your pitying eye.Where my love is can you tell?Thinks he of me ill or well?”“I know not,” answered the cloud, “ask the wind.”Then she saw a tiny breeze playing among the field flowers, and called out:“Gentle Breezelet, soul of air,Look not lightly on my pain;Kindly lift me from despair,Help me freedom to regain.Where my love is can you tell?Thinks he of me ill or well?”“Ask that little star yonder,” answered the breeze, “she knows more than I.”Sudolisu raised her beautiful eyes to the twinkling stars and said:“Shining Star, God’s light on high,Look down and prithee see;Behold me weep and hear me sigh,Then help and pity me.Where my love is canst thou tell?Thinks he of me ill or well?”“You will learn more from the moon,” answered the star; “she lives nearer the earth than I, and sees everything that goes on there.”The moon was just rising from her silver bed when Sudolisu called to her:“Pearl of the Sky, thou radiant Moon,Thy watch o’er the stars pray leave,Throw thy soft glance o’er the earth ere I swoon,O’ercome by my sorrows I weep and I grieve.I pine for my friend, oh ease thou my heart,And say, am I loved? In his thoughts have I part?”“Princess,” replied the moon, “I know nothing of your friend. But wait a few hours, the sun will have then risen; he knows everything, and will surely be able to tell you.”So the princess kept her eyes fixed upon that part of the sky where the sun first appears, chasing away the darkness like a flock of birds. When he came forth in all his glory she said:“Soul of the World, thou deep fountain of life,Eye of all-powerful God,Visit my prison, dark scene of sad strife,Raise up my soul from the sod,With hope that my friend whom I pine for and loveMay come to my rescue. Say, where does he rove?”“Sweet Sudolisu,” answered the sun, “dry the tears that like pearls roll down your sad and lovely face. Let your troubled heart be at peace, for your friend the prince is now on his way to rescue you. He has recovered the magic ring from the Nether World, and many armies from those countries have assembled to follow him. He is now moving towards Kostey’s palace, and intends to punish him. But all this will be of no avail, and Kostey will gain the victory, if the prince does not make use of other means which I am now on my way to provide him with. Farewell; be brave, he whom you love will come to your aid and save you from Kostey and his sorceries; happiness is in store for you both.”The sun then rose upon a distant land where Prince Junak, mounted on a powerful steed and clad in golden armour, assembled his forces to fight against the giant Kostey. Thrice he had dreamt of the beautiful princess shut up in the Sleeping Palace, for the fame of her loveliness had reached him, and he loved without having seen.“Leave your army where it is,” said the sun, “it will not be of the slightest use in fighting against Kostey, he is proof against all weapons. The only way to rescue the princess is to kill him, and there is but one who can tell you how to do it, and that is the witch, old Yaga. I will show you how to find the horse that will carry you straight to her. First take the road to the east, and walk on till you come to a wide plain: there, right in the middle of the plain, are three oaks, and in the centre of these, lying close to the ground, is an iron door with a copper handle. Behind the door is the horse, also an invisible club; both are necessary for the work you have to do. You will learn the rest afterwards. Farewell.”This advice astonished the prince greatly; he hardly knew what to do. After deep reflection he crossed himself, took the magic ring from his finger and cast it into the sea. Instantly the army vanished like mist before the wind, and when not a trace of it was left he took the road to the east. After walking straight on for eight days he reached a large green plain, in the middle of which grew the three oaks, and in the centre of these, close to the ground, was the iron door with the copper handle. Opening the door, he found a winding staircase which led to a second door bound with iron, and shut by means of a huge padlock sixty pounds in weight. At this moment he heard the neighing of a horse, the sound being followed by the opening of eleven other iron doors. There he saw the war-horse which centuries ago had been bewitched by a magician. The prince whistled; the horse immediately bounded towards him, at the same time breaking the twelve iron chains that fastened him to the manger. He was a beautiful creature, strong, light, handsome, full of fire and grace; his eyes flashed lightnings, from his nostrils came flames of fire, his mane was like a cloud of gold, he was certainly a marvel of a horse.“Prince Junak,” said the steed, “I have waited centuries for such a knight as you; here I am, ready to carry you and serve you faithfully. Mount upon my back, and take hold of the invisible club that hangs at the pommel of the saddle. You yourself will not need to use it; give it your orders, it will carry them out and do the fighting itself. Now we will start; may God look after us! Tell me where you wish to go, and you shall be there directly.”The prince quickly told the horse his history, mounted, seized the club, and set off. The creature capered, galloped, flew, and swam in the air higher than the highest forests but lower than the clouds; he crossed mountains, rivers, and precipices; he barely touched the blades of grass in passing over them, and went so lightly along the roads that he did not raise one grain of dust.Towards sunset Junak found himself close to an immense forest, in the centre of which stood Yaga’s house. All around were oaks and pines hundreds of years old, untouched by the axe of man. These enormous trees, lit up by the rays of the setting sun, seemed to look with astonishment at their strange guest. The silence was absolute; not a bird sang in the branches, not an insect hummed in the air, not a worm crawled upon the ground. The only sound was that made by the horse as he broke through the underwood. Then they came in sight of a small house supported by a cock’s foot, round which it turned as on a movable pivot. Prince Junak cried:“Turn round, little house, turn round,I want to come inside;Let thy back to the forest be found,Thy door to me open wide.”The little house turned round, and the prince entering saw old Yaga, who immediately cried out, “What, Prince Junak! How have you come here, where no one ever enters?”“You are a silly old witch, to worry me with questions instead of making me welcome,” said the prince.At these words old Yaga jumped up and hastened to attend to his needs. She prepared food and drink, made him a soft bed where he could sleep comfortably, and then leaving the house passed the night out of doors. On her return in the morning the prince related all his adventures and confided his plans.“Prince Junak,” said she, “you have undertaken a very difficult task, but your courage will enable you to accomplish it successfully. I will tell you how to kill Kostey, for without that you can do nothing. Now, in the very midst of the ocean lies the Island of Eternal Life. Upon this island is an oak tree, and at the foot of it, hidden in the earth, a coffer bound with iron. A hare is shut up in this coffer, and under her sits a grey duck whose body contains an egg. Within this egg is Kostey’s life—if it be broken he dies. Good-bye, Prince Junak, start without loss of time. Your horse will carry you to the island.”Junak mounted his horse, spoke a few words to him, and the brave creature fled through space with the swiftness of an arrow. Leaving the forest and its enormous trees behind, they soon reached the shores of the ocean. Fishermen’s nets lay on the beach, and in one of them was a large sea fish who, struggling to free itself, spoke to the prince in a human voice.“Prince Junak,” he said sadly, “free me from my prison; I assure you you will lose nothing by doing me this service.”Junak did what was required of him, and threw the fish back into the water. It plunged and disappeared, but he paid little attention to it, so occupied was he with his own thoughts. In the far distance could be seen the rocks of the Island of Eternal Life, but there seemed no way of reaching it. Leaning on his club he thought and thought, and ever as he thought he grew sadder and sadder.“What is the matter, Prince Junak? Has anything vexed you?” asked his horse.“How can I help grieving when, while in sight of the island, I can go no further? How can we cross the sea?”“Get on my back, prince, I will be your bridge; only take care to hold on tight.”The prince held firmly to its mane, and the horse leapt into the sea. At first they were plunged right beneath the waves, but rising again to the surface swam easily across. The sun was about to set when the prince dismounted on the Island of Eternal Life. He first took off his horse’s harness, and leaving him to browse on the green grass, hurried to the top of a distant hill, whence he could see a large oak. Without losing a moment he hastened towards it, seized the tree with both hands, pulled at it with all his might, and after the most violent efforts tore it up by the roots from the place it had filled for centuries. The tree groaned and fell, and the hole in which it had been planted appeared like an immense case. Right at the bottom of this case was a coffer bound with iron. The prince took it up, broke the lock by striking it with a stone, opened it and seized the hare that was trying to make its escape. The grey duck that had lain underneath flew off towards the sea: the prince fired, struck the bird, the latter dropped its egg into the sea, and both were swallowed by the waves. Junak gave a cry of despair and rushed to the beach. At first he could see nothing. After a few minutes there was a slight movement of the waves, while upon the surface swam the fish whose life he had saved. It came towards him, right on to the sand, and dropping the lost egg at his feet, said: “You see, prince, I have not forgotten your kindness, and now I have found it in my power to be of service to you.”Having thus spoken it disappeared in the water. The prince took the egg, mounted his horse, and crossing the sea with his heart full of hope, journeyed towards the island where Princess Sudolisu kept watch over her sleeping subjects in the Enchanted Palace. The latter was surrounded by a wall, and guarded by the Dragon with Twelve Heads. Now these heads went to sleep in turn, six at a time, so it was impossible to take him unawares or to kill him, for that could be done only by his own blows.On reaching the palace gates Junak sent his invisible club forward to clear the way, whereupon it threw itself upon the dragon, and began to beat all the heads unmercifully. The blows came so thick and fast that the body was soon crushed to pieces. Still the dragon lived and beat the air with its claws. Then it opened its twelve jaws from which darted pointed tongues, but it could not lay hold of the invisible club. At last, tormented on all sides and filled with rage, it buried its sharp claws in its own body and died. The prince then entered the palace gates, and having put his faithful horse in the stables and armed himself with his invisible club, made his way for the tower in which the princess was shut up. On seeing him she cried out, “Prince, I rejoiced to see your victory over the dragon. There is yet a more terrible foe to conquer, and he is my jailor, the cruel Kostey. Beware of him, for if he should kill you, I shall throw myself out of window into the precipice beneath.”“Be comforted, my princess: for in this egg I hold the life or death of Kostey.”Then turning to the invisible club, he said, “Press forward, my invisible club; strike your best, and rid the earth of this wicked giant.”The club began by breaking down the iron doors, and thus reached Kostey. The giant was soon so crippled with blows that his teeth were smashed, lightnings flashed from his eyes, and he rolled round and round like a pin-cushion. Had he been a man he must have died under such treatment. But he was no man, this master of sorcery. So he managed to get on his feet and look for his tormentor. The blows from the club rained hard upon him all the time, and with such effect that his groans could be heard all over the island. On approaching the window he saw Prince Junak.“Ah, wretch!” cried the ogre, “it is you, is it, who torments me in this way!” and he prepared to blow upon him with his poisonous breath. But the prince instantly crushed the egg between his hands, the shell broke, the white and yellow mingled and flowed to the ground, and Kostey died.As the sorcerer breathed his last, the enchantments vanished and the sleeping islanders awoke. The army, once more afoot, advanced with beating drums to the palace, and everything fell into its accustomed place. As soon as Princess Sudolisu was freed from her prison she held out her white hand to her deliverer, and thanking him in the most touching words, led him to the throne and placed him at her side. The twelve maids of honour having chosen young and brave warriors, ranged themselves with their lovers round the queen. Then the doors were thrown open, and the priests in their robes entered, bearing a golden tray of wedding rings. Thereupon the marriage ceremony was gone through, and the lovers united in God’s name.After the wedding there were feasting and music and dancing, as is usual on such occasions, and they all enjoyed themselves. It makes one glad to think how happy they were, and what a glorious time they had after their misfortunes.","['ancient', 'live', 'king', 'queen', 'former', 'latter', 'young', 'although', 'love',

328,slavic,Ohnivak,"A certain king had a beautiful garden which contained a number of very rare trees, but the most rare of all was an apple tree. It stood in the middle of the garden, and produced one golden apple every day. In the morning the blossom unfolded, during the day you might watch the fruit grow, and before nightfall the apple was fully ripe. The next day the same thing occurred—indeed, it happened regularly every twenty-four hours. Nevertheless, no ripe fruit ever remained on the tree on the following day; the apple disappeared, no one knew how or when, and this deeply grieved the king.At last he could bear it no longer, and calling his eldest son to him, said: “My child, I wish you to keep watch in the garden to-night, and see if you can find out what becomes of my golden apples. I will reward you with the choice of all my treasures; if you should be lucky enough to get hold of the thief, and bring him to me, I would gladly give you half my kingdom.”The young prince girded his trusty sword to his side, and with his crossbow on his shoulder and a good stock of well-tempered arrows, went into the garden to mount guard. And as he sat under the apple tree a great drowsiness came over him which he could not resist; his arms dropped, his eyes closed, and stretching himself on the grass he slept as soundly as if he had been in his own bed at home, nor did he awake until day dawn, and then he saw that the apple had disappeared.When questioned by his father, he said that no thieves had come, but that the apple had vanished all the same. The king shook his head, for he did not believe a word of it. Then, turning to his second son, he bade him keep watch, and promised him a handsome reward if he should catch the thief.So the second son armed himself with everything necessary and went into the garden. But he succeeded no better than his brother, for he could not resist the desire to sleep, and when he awoke the apple was no longer there.When his father asked him how it disappeared, he replied, “No one took it, it vanished of itself.”“Now, my dearest one, take your turn,” said the king to his youngest son; “although you are young, and have less experience than your brothers, let us see if you cannot succeed where they have failed. If you are willing, go, and may God help you.”Towards evening, when it began to be dusk, the youngest son went into the garden to keep watch. He took with him a sword and crossbow, a few well-tempered arrows, and a hedgehog’s skin as a sort of apron, for he thought that while sitting under the tree, if he spread the skin over his knees, the pricking of the bristles on his hands might keep him awake. And so it did, for by this means he was able to resist the drowsiness that came over him.At midnight Ohnivak, the bird of fire, flew down and alighted upon the tree, and was just going off with the apple when the prince fixed an arrow to his bow, and letting it fly, struck the bird under the wing. Although wounded, it flew away, dropping one of its feathers upon the ground. That night for the first time the apple remained untouched upon the tree.“Have you caught the thief?” asked the king next day.“Not altogether, but no doubt we shall have him in time. I have a bit of his trappings.” And he gave the king the feather, and told him all that had taken place.The king was charmed with the feather; so lovely and bright was it that it illumined all the galleries of the palace, and they needed no other light.The courtiers told the king that the feather could only belong to Ohnivak, the bird of fire, and that it was worth all the rest of the royal treasures put together.From that time Ohnivak came no more to the garden, and the apples remained untouched. Yet the king could think of nothing else but how to possess this marvellous bird. At last, beginning to despair of ever seeing it, he was filled with melancholy, and would remain for hours in deep thought; thus he became really ill, and every day continued to grow worse.One day he summoned his three sons before him and said, “My dear children, you see the sad state I am in. If I could but hear the bird Ohnivak sing just once I should be cured of this disease of the heart; otherwise it will be my death. Whichever of you shall succeed in catching Ohnivak alive and inducing him to sing to me, to him I will give half of my kingdom and the heirship to the throne.”Having taken leave of their father the brothers set off. They travelled together until they came to a part of the forest where the road branched off in three directions.“Which turning shall we take?” asked the eldest.The second brother answered, “We are three, and three roads lie before us; let us each choose one, thus we shall treble our chances of finding the bird, for we shall seek it in three different countries.”“That is a good idea, but how shall each one decide which way to choose?”The youngest brother said, “I will leave the choice to you two, and will take whichever road you leave me.”So each took the road that chance decided for him, agreeing that when their mission was over they would return to the point of departure. In order to recognise the place again each one planted the branch of a tree at the cross roads, and they believed that he whose branch should take root and grow into a big tree would be successful in the quest.When each one had planted his branch at the chosen road they started off. The eldest rode on, and never stopped until he reached the top of a high mountain; there he dismounted, and let his horse graze while he ate his breakfast. Suddenly a red fox came up, and speaking in the language of men, said: “Pray, my handsome prince, give me a little of what you are eating; I am very hungry.”For answer the prince let fly an arrow from his crossbow, but it is impossible to say whether he hit the fox for it vanished and did not appear again.The second brother, without meeting with any adventure, reached a wide-stretching moor, where he stopped for his meal. The red fox appeared to him and begged for food; but he also refused food to the famished fox, and shot at him. The creature disappeared as before.The youngest travelled on till he came to the banks of a river. Feeling tired and hungry, he got down from his horse and began his breakfast; while he was eating, up came the red fox.“Please, young sir,” said the fox, “give me a morsel to satisfy my hunger.”The prince threw him a piece of meat, and spoke kindly to him.“Come near, do not be afraid, my red fox; I see you are more hungry than I, but there is enough for us both.”And he divided all his provisions into two equal parts, one for himself, and one for the poor red fox.When the latter had eaten to his heart’s content, he said: “You have fed me well, in return I will serve you well; mount your horse and follow me. If you do everything I tell you, the Bird of Fire shall be yours.”Then he set off at a run before the horseman, clearing the road for him with his bushy tail. By means of this marvellous broom, mountains were cut down, ravines filled up, and rivers bridged over.The young prince followed at a gallop, without the slightest wish to stop, until they came to a castle built of copper.“The Bird of Fire is in this castle,” said the fox; “you must enter exactly at midday, for then the guards will be asleep, and you will pass unnoticed. Above all, beware of stopping anywhere. In the first apartment you will find twelve birds black as night, in golden cages; in the second, twelve golden birds in wooden cages; in the third, Ohnivak, the bird of fire, roosting on his perch. Near him are two cages, one of wood and the other of gold; be sure you put him in the wooden cage—you would be sorry for it if he were put into the golden one.”The prince entered the castle, and found everything just as the fox had told him. Having passed through the two rooms he came to the third, and there saw the fire-bird on his perch, apparently asleep. It was indeed a beautiful creature, so beautiful that the prince’s heart beat high with joy. He handled him without difficulty, and put him into the wooden cage, thinking at the same time to himself that it could hardly be right for so lovely a bird to be in such an ugly cage, a golden cage could be the only right place for him. So he took him out of the wooden cage and placed him in the golden one. Hardly had he shut the door when the bird opened his eyes and gave a piercing scream; so shrill was it that it awoke the other birds, who began to sing as loud as they could, and gave the alarm to the guards at the palace door. These rushed in, seized the prince, and dragged him before the king. The latter was very angry, and said: “Infamous thief, who are you to have dared to force an entrance, and pass through my sentinels, to steal my bird Ohnivak?”“I am not a thief,” answered the young prince indignantly, “I have come to reclaim a thief whom you protect. I am the son of a king, and in my father’s gardens is an apple tree that bears golden fruit. It blossoms at morning-time, while during the day the flower develops into an apple that grows and ripens after sunset. Now in the night your bird robbed us of our golden apples, and though I watched and wounded him I could not catch him. My father is dying with grief because of this, and the only remedy that can save and restore him to health, is that he may listen to the fire-bird’s song. This is why I beg your majesty to give him me.”“You may have him,” said the king, “but on one condition, that you bring me Zlato-Nrivak, the horse with the golden mane.”So the prince had to go away empty-handed.“Why did you not do as I told you? Why must you go and take the golden cage?” said the fox, in despair at the failure of the expedition.“I admit it was my own fault,” said the prince, “but do not punish me by being angry. I want your advice: tell me how I am to get Zlato-Nrivak?”“I know how it can be done,” answered the red fox, “and I will help you once more. Get on your horse, follow me, and do as I tell you.”The fox ran on in front, clearing the road with his bushy tail. The prince followed at a gallop, until they came to a castle built entirely of silver.“In that castle lives the Horse with the Golden Mane,” said the fox. “You will have to go exactly at midday, when the sentinels are asleep; thus you will get past safe and sound. But mind, do not stop anywhere. You must pass through three stables. In the first are twelve black horses with golden bridles; in the second, twelve white horses with black bridles; in the third stands Zlato-Nrivak in front of his manger, while near him are two bridles, one of gold, the other of black leather. Whatever you do, beware of using the first, for you will surely repent it.”The prince waited until the appointed time and then entered the castle, finding everything exactly as the fox had said. In the third stable stood Zlato-Nrivak, eating fire that flared up out of his silver trough.The Horse with the Golden Mane was so beautiful that the prince could not take his eyes off him. Quickly unhooking the black leather bridle, he put it over the horse’s head. The animal made no resistance, but was gentle and quiet as a lamb. Then the prince looked covetously at the golden bridle sparkling with gems, and said to himself, “It is a shame that such a splendid creature should be guided by these ugly black reins while there is a bridle here far more suited to him, and that is indeed his by right.” So, forgetting his late experience and the warnings of the red fox, he tore off the black bridle and put in its place that of gold set with precious stones. No sooner did the horse feel the change than he began to neigh and caper about, while all the other horses answered with a perfect storm of neighings. The sentinels, aroused by the noise, ran in, and seizing the prince, led him before the king.“Insolent thief,” cried the enraged monarch, “how is it that you have escaped the vigilance of the guards and have dared to lay hands upon my horse with the golden mane? It is really disgraceful.”“True, I am nothing better,” replied the prince proudly, “but I was forced to do it against my will.” And he related all his misadventures at the copper castle, adding that it was impossible to obtain the fire-bird except in exchange for Zlato-Nrivak, and that he hoped his majesty would make him a present of the horse.“Most willingly,” answered the king, “but on one condition, that you bring me the Maiden with the Golden Locks: she lives in the golden castle on the shores of the Black Sea.”The fox was waiting in the forest the prince’s return, and when he saw him come back without the horse he was very angry indeed.“Did I not warn you,” said he, “to be content with the black leather bridle? It is really a loss of time to try and help such an ungrateful fellow, for it seems impossible to make you hear reason.”“Don’t be cross,” said the prince, “I confess that I am in fault; I ought to have obeyed your orders. But have a little more patience with me and help me out of this difficulty.”“Very well; but this will certainly be the last time. If you do just as you are told we may yet repair all that has been spoilt by your imprudence. Mount your horse and follow—off!”The fox ran on in front, clearing the road with his bushy tail, until they reached the shores of the Black Sea.“That palace yonder,” said the fox, “is the residence of the Queen of the Ocean Kingdom. She has three daughters; it is the youngest who has the golden hair, and is called Zlato-Vlaska. Now you must first go to the queen and ask her to give you one of her daughters in marriage. If she takes kindly to your proposal she will bid you choose, and mind you take that princess who is the most plainly dressed.”The queen received him most graciously, and when he explained the object of his visit she led him into a room where the three daughters were spinning.They were so much alike that no one could possibly distinguish one from the other, and they were all so marvellously lovely that when the young prince looked upon them he dared hardly breathe. Their hair was carefully covered by a veil through which one could not distinguish the colour of it, but their dresses were different. The first wore a gown and veil embroidered with gold, and used a golden distaff; the second had on a gown embroidered with silver and held a distaff of the same metal; the third wore a gown and veil of dazzling whiteness, and her distaff was made of wood.The mother bade the prince choose, whereupon he pointed to the maiden clothed in white, saying, “Give me this one to wife.”“Ah,” said the queen, “some one has been letting you into the secret: but wait a little, we shall meet again to-morrow.”All that night the prince lay awake, wondering how he should manage not to make a mistake on the morrow. At dawn he was already at the palace gates, which he had hardly entered when the princess clothed in white chanced to pass: it was Zlato-Vlaska, and she had come to meet him.“If it is your wish to choose me again to-day,” she said, “observe carefully, and take the maiden around whose head buzzes a small fly.”In the afternoon the queen took the prince into a room where her three daughters sat, and said: “If among these princesses you recognise the one you chose yesterday she shall be yours; if not, you must die.”The young girls stood side by side, dressed alike in costly robes, and all had golden hair. The prince was puzzled, and their beauty and splendour dazzled him. For some time he could hardly see distinctly; then, all of a sudden, a small fly buzzed over the head of one of the princesses.“This is the maiden who belongs to me,” cried he, “and whom I chose yesterday.”The queen, astonished that he should have guessed correctly, said, “Quite right, but I cannot let you have her until you have submitted to another trial, which shall be explained to you to-morrow.”On the morrow she pointed out to him a large fish-pond which lay in the forest, and giving him a small golden sieve, said: “If with this sieve you can, before sunset, empty that fish-pond yonder, I will give you my daughter with the golden hair, but if you fail you will lose your life.”The prince took the sieve, and, going down to the pond, plunged it in to try his luck; but no sooner had he lifted it up than all the water ran out through the holes—not a drop was left behind. Not knowing what to do, he sat down on the bank with the sieve in his hand, wondering in what possible way the difficulty might be overcome.“Why are you so sad?” asked the maiden in white, as she came towards him.“Because I fear you will never be mine,” sighed he; “your mother has given me an impossible task.”“Come, cheer up, away with fear; it will all be right in the end.”Thereupon she took the sieve and threw it into the fishpond. Instantly the water turned to foam on the surface, and a thick vapour rose up, which fell in a fog so dense that nothing could be seen through it. Then the prince heard footsteps, and turning round saw his horse coming towards him, with his bridle down and the red fox at his side.“Mount quickly,” said the horse, “there is not a moment to lose; lift the maiden in front of you.”The faithful steed flew like an arrow, and sped rapidly along over the road that had been recently cleared by the bushy tail of the red fox. But this time, instead of leading, the red fox followed, his tail working marvels as he went: it destroyed the bridges, reopened the ravines, raised high mountains, and in fact put back everything as it used to be.The prince felt very happy as he rode along, holding the Princess with the Golden Hair, but it saddened him much to think he would have to give up all thought of marrying her himself, and that within a few short hours he must leave her with the king of the silver palace: the nearer he came to it, the more wretched he grew. The red fox, who noticed this, said: “It appears to me that you do not want to exchange the lovely Zlato-Vlaska for the Horse with the Golden Mane: is it not so? Well, I have helped you so far, I will see what I can do for you now.”And having thus spoken he turned a somersault over the stump of a fallen tree which lay in the forest: while, to the prince’s amazement, he was immediately transformed into a young girl exactly resembling the Princess with the Golden Hair.“Now, leave your real bride in the forest,” said the transformed fox, “and take me with you to offer to the king of the silver palace in exchange for his horse Zlato-Nrivak. Mount the horse, return here, and escape with the maid you love; I will manage the rest.”The king of the silver castle received the maiden without the least suspicion, and handed over in exchange the Horse with the Golden Mane, over whose back lay the bejewelled bridle. The prince left at once.At the palace all were busy preparing the wedding feast, for the marriage was to take place immediately, and everything was to be of the most costly description. Invitations had been out to all the grandees of the land.Towards the end of the feast, when every one had drunk his fill of wine and pleasure, the king asked his guests their opinions on the charms of his bride.“She is most beautiful,” said one, “in fact, it would be impossible for her to be more lovely; only, it seems to me that her eyes are somewhat like those of a fox.”The words were hardly out of his mouth when the royal bride vanished, while in her place sat a red fox, who with one vigorous bound sprang through the door and disappeared to rejoin the prince, who had hastened on in front. With sweeping strokes of his bushy tail he overthrew bridges, reopened precipices, and heaped up mountains; but it was very hard work for the poor thing, and he did not come up with the runaways until they had almost reached the copper castle. Here they all had a rest, while the red fox turned a somersault and transformed himself into a horse resembling the one with the golden mane. Then the prince entered the copper castle and exchanged the transformed fox for the fire-bird Ohnivak, the king having no suspicions whatever. The red fox, having thus deceived the monarch, reassumed his own shape and hurried after the departing prince, whom he did not overtake until they had reached the banks of the river where they had first become acquainted.“Now here you are, prince,” said the red fox, “in possession of Ohnivak, of the lovely Zlato-Vlaska, and of the Horse with the Golden Mane. Henceforth you can manage without my help, so return to your father’s house in peace and joy; but, take warning, do not stop anywhere on the way, for if you do some misfortune will overtake you.”With these words the red fox vanished, while the prince continued his journey unhindered. In his hand he held the golden cage that contained the fire-bird, and at his side the lovely Zlato-Vlaska rode the Horse with the Golden Mane; truly, he was the happiest of men.When he reached the cross roads where he had parted from his brothers, he hastened to look for the branches they had planted. His alone had become a spreading tree, theirs were both withered. Delighted with this proof of divine favour, he felt a strong desire to rest for a while under the shadow of his own tree; he therefore dismounted, and assisting the princess to do the same, fastened their horses to one of the branches and hung up the cage containing Ohnivak on another: within a few moments they were all sound asleep.Meanwhile the two elder brothers arrived at the same place by different roads, and both with empty hands. There they found their two branches withered, that of their brother having grown into a splendid tree. Under the shade of the latter he lay sleeping; by his side was the Maid with the Golden Locks; the horse, Zlato-Nrivak, was fastened to a tree, and the fire-bird roosted in his golden cage.The hearts of the two brothers were filled with envious and wicked thoughts, and they whispered thus to one another, “Just think what will become of us—the youngest will receive half of the kingdom during our father’s life and succeed to the throne at his death; why not cut his throat at once? One of us will take the Maid with the Golden Locks, the other can carry the bird to our father and keep the Horse with the Golden Mane; as for the kingdom, we will divide it between us.”After this debate they killed their youngest brother and cut up his body into small pieces, while they threatened to treat Zlato-Vlaska in the same way if she attempted to disobey them.On reaching home they sent the Horse with the Golden Mane to the marble stables, the cage containing Ohnivak was placed in the room where their father lay sick, and the princess was allowed a beautiful suite of apartments and maids of honour to attend her.When the king, who was much weakened by suffering, had looked at the bird, he asked after his youngest son. To which the brothers replied: “We have not seen or heard anything of him, it is very likely that he has been killed.”The poor old man was much affected—it seemed, indeed, as if his last hour had come. The fire-bird moped and refused to sing; the Horse with the Golden Mane stood with his head bent down before his manger, and would eat no food; while Princess Zlato-Vlaska remained as silent as if she had been born dumb, her beautiful hair was neglected and uncombed, and she wept—her tears fell fast.Now as the red fox chanced to pass through the forest he came upon the mangled body of the youngest brother, and he at once set to work to put the scattered pieces together, but was unable to restore them to life. At that moment a raven, accompanied by two young ones, came hovering overhead. The fox crouched behind a bramble bush; and when one of the young birds alighted upon the body to feed, he seized it and made a pretence of strangling it. Upon which the parent bird, full of anxious love and fear, perched upon a branch close by and croaked as if to say, “Let my poor little nestling go. I have done you no harm, neither have I worried you; let him free, and I will take the first opportunity of returning your kindness.”“Just so,” replied the red fox, “for I am greatly in need of some kindness. Now if you will fetch me some of the Water of Death, and some of the Water of Life, from the Red Sea, I will let your nestling go safe and sound.”The old raven promised to fetch the water, and went off at once.Within three days he returned, carrying in his beak two small bottles, one full of the Water of Death, the other of the Water of Life. When the red fox received them he wished first to try their effect upon some living creature, so he cut the small raven up, and joining the pieces together, watered them with the Water of Death. Instantly they became a living bird, without mark or join anywhere. This he sprinkled with the Water of Life, upon which the young raven spread its wings and flew off to its family.The red fox then performed the same operation on the body of the young prince, and with the same happy result, for he rose again perfect in form, and having about him no wound scars. On coming to life again, all he said was, “Dear me! What a pleasant sleep I have had.”“I believe you,” replied the red fox, “you would have gone on sleeping for ever if I had not awakened you. And what a foolish young man you are: did I not particularly order you not to stop anywhere, but to go straight back to your father’s house?”He then related all that his brothers had done, and having obtained a peasant’s dress for him, led him to the outskirts of the forest, close to the royal palace, where he left him.The young prince then entered the palace grounds, unrecognised by the servants, and on representing that he was in need of employment, was appointed stable-boy to the royal stables. Some little time after he heard the grooms lamenting that the Horse with the Golden Mane would eat no food.“What a pity it is,” said they, “that this splendid steed should starve to death; he droops his head and will take nothing.”“Give him,” said the disguised prince, “some pea-straw; I bet you anything he will eat that.”“But do you really think so? Why, our rough draught horses would refuse such coarse food.”The prince’s only answer was to fetch a bundle of pea-straw, which he put into Zlato-Nrivak’s marble trough: then, passing his hand gently over his neck and mane, he said to him, “Grieve no more, my horse with the golden mane.”The beautiful creature recognised his master’s voice, and neighing with joy, greedily devoured the pea-straw.The news was noised about from one end of the palace to the other, and the sick king summoned the boy to his presence.“I hear you have made Zlato-Nrivak eat,” said his majesty; “do you think you could make my fire-bird sing? Go and examine him closely: he is very sad, he droops his wings, and will neither eat nor drink. Ah me! if he dies I shall certainly die too.”“Your majesty may rest assured, the bird will not die. Let him have some husks of barley to eat, then he will soon be all right and begin to sing.”The king ordered them to be brought, and the disguised prince put a handful into Ohnivak’s cage, saying, “Cheer up, my fire-bird.”As soon as Ohnivak heard his master’s voice he shook himself, and made his feathers shine with more than their usual brightness. Then he began to dance about his cage, and pecking up the husks, sang so exquisitely that the king immediately felt better, and it was as if a great weight had been lifted off his heart. The fire-bird again burst into song, and this so affected the king that he sat up quite well, and embraced the disguised prince out of very gratitude.“Now,” said he, “teach me how to restore to health this beautiful maiden with the golden hair whom my sons brought back with them; for she will not speak a word, her beautiful hair remains uncared for, and her tears fall night and day.”“If your majesty will allow me to speak a few words to her, it may be the means of making her bright and happy.”The king himself led the way to her apartments, and the disguised prince, taking her hand, said: “Look up a moment, sweetheart; why these tears? And why grieve thus, dear bride?”The maiden knew him at once, and with a cry of joy threw herself into his arms. This astonished the king mightily, and he could not for the life of him think how a stable-boy dare address such a princess as his “dear bride.”The prince then addressed the king thus: “And are you indeed the only one who does not know me? How is it, my father and sovereign, that you have not recognised your youngest son? I alone have succeeded in obtaining the Fire-Bird, the Horse with the Golden Mane, and the Maid with the Golden Hair.”Thereupon he related all his adventures, and Zlato-Vlaska in her turn told how the wicked brothers had threatened to kill her if she betrayed them. As for these bad men, they shook from head to foot, and trembled like leaves in the wind. The indignant king ordered them to be executed then and there.Not very long after these events the youngest prince married the beautiful Zlato-Vlaska, and the king gave him half of his kingdom as a wedding present. When the old king died he reigned in his stead, and lived happily with the princess ever after.","['certain', 'king', 'beautiful', 'garden', 'contain', 'number', 'rare', 'tree', 'rare', 'apple',

559,slavic,The Abode of the Gods - 1. The Two Brothers,"Once upon a time there were two brothers whose father had left them but a small fortune. The eldest grew very rich, but at the same time cruel and wicked, whereas there was nowhere a more honest or kinder man than the younger. But he remained poor, and had many children, so that at times they could scarcely get bread to eat. At last, one day there was not even this in the house, so he went to his rich brother and asked him for a loaf of bread. Waste of time! His rich brother only called him beggar and vagabond, and slammed the door in his face.The poor fellow, after this brutal reception, did not know which way to turn. Hungry, scantily clad, shivering with cold, his legs could scarcely carry him along. He had not the heart to go home, with nothing for the children, so he went towards the mountain forest. But all he found there were some wild pears that had fallen to the ground. He had to content himself with eating these, though they set his teeth on edge. But what was he to do to warm himself, for the east wind with its chill blast pierced him through and through. “Where shall I go?” he said; “what will become of us in the cottage? There is neither food nor fire, and my brother has driven me from his door.” It was just then he remembered having heard that the top of the mountain in front of him was made of crystal, and had a fire for ever burning upon it. “I will try and find it,” he said, “and then I may be able to warm myself a little.” So he went on climbing higher and higher till he reached the top, when he was startled to see twelve strange beings sitting round a huge fire. He stopped for a moment, but then said to himself, “What have I to lose? Why should I fear? God is with me. Courage!”So he advanced towards the fire, and bowing respectfully, said: “Good people, take pity on my distress. I am very poor, no one cares for me, I have not even a fire in my cottage; will you let me warm myself at yours?” They all looked kindly at him, and one of them said: “My son, come sit down with us and warm yourself.”So he sat down, and felt warm directly he was near them. But he dared not speak while they were silent. What astonished him most was that they changed seats one after another, and in such a way that each one passed round the fire and came back to his own place. When he drew near the fire an old man with long white beard and bald head arose from the flames and spoke to him thus:“Man, waste not thy life here; return to thy cottage, work, and live honestly. Take as many embers as thou wilt, we have more than we need.”And having said this he disappeared. Then the twelve filled a large sack with embers, and, putting it on the poor man’s shoulders, advised him to hasten home.Humbly thanking them, he set off. As he went he wondered why the embers did not feel hot, and why they should weigh no more than a sack of paper. He was thankful that he should be able to have a fire, but imagine his astonishment when on arriving home he found the sack to contain as many gold pieces as there had been embers; he almost went out of his mind with joy at the possession of so much money. With all his heart he thanked those who had been so ready to help him in his need.He was now rich, and rejoiced to be able to provide for his family. Being curious to find out how many gold pieces there were, and not knowing how to count, he sent his wife to his rich brother for the loan of a quart measure.This time the brother was in a better temper, so he lent what was asked of him, but said mockingly, “What can such beggars as you have to measure?”The wife replied, “Our neighbour owes us some wheat; we want to be sure he returns us the right quantity.”The rich brother was puzzled, and suspecting something he, unknown to his sister-in-law, put some grease inside the measure. The trick succeeded, for on getting it back he found a piece of gold sticking to it. Filled with astonishment, he could only suppose his brother had joined a band of robbers: so he hurried to his brother’s cottage, and threatened to bring him before the Justice of the Peace if he did not confess where the gold came from. The poor man was troubled, and, dreading to offend his brother, told the story of his journey to the Crystal Mountain.Now the elder brother had plenty of money for himself, yet he was envious of the brother’s good fortune, and became greatly displeased when he found that his brother won every one’s esteem by the good use he made of his wealth. At last he determined to visit the Crystal Mountain himself.“I may meet with as good luck as my brother,” said he to himself.Upon reaching the Crystal Mountain he found the twelve seated round the fire as before, and thus addressed them:“I beg of you, good people, to let me warm myself, for it is bitterly cold, and I am poor and homeless.”But one of them replied, “My son, the hour of thy birth was favourable; thou art rich, but a miser; thou art wicked, for thou hast dared to lie to us. Well dost thou deserve thy punishment.”Amazed and terrified he stood silent, not daring to speak. Meanwhile the twelve changed places one after another, each at last returning to his own seat. Then from the midst of the flames arose the white-bearded old man and spoke thus sternly to the rich man:“Woe unto the wilful! Thy brother is virtuous, therefore have I blessed him. As for thee, thou art wicked, and so shalt not escape our vengeance.”At these words the twelve arose. The first seized the unfortunate man, struck him, and passed him on to the second; the second also struck him and passed him on to the third; and so did they all in their turn, until he was given up to the old man, who disappeared with him into the fire.Days, weeks, months went by, but the rich man never returned, and none knew what had become of him. I think, between you and me, the younger brother had his suspicions but he very wisely kept them to himself.","['upon', 'time', 'brother', 'whose', 'father', 'left', 'small', 'fortune', 'eldest',

636,slavic,The Finest Liar in the World,"At the edge of a wood there lived an old man who had only one son, and one day he called the boy to him and said he wanted some corn ground, but the youth must be sure never to enter any mill where the miller was beardless.The boy took the corn and set out, and before he had gone very far he saw a large mill in front of him, with a beardless man standing in the doorway.‘Good greeting, beardless one!’ cried he.‘Good greeting, sonny,’ replied the man.‘Could I grind something here?’‘Yes, certainly! I will finish what I am doing and then you can grind as long as you like.’But suddenly the boy remembered what his father had told him, and bade farewell to the man, and went further down the river, till he came to another mill, not knowing that as soon as his back was turned the beardless man had picked up a bag of corn and run hastily to the same mill before him. When the boy reached the second mill, and saw a second beardless man sitting there, he did not stop, and walked on till he came to a third mill. But this time also the beardless man had been too clever for him, and had arrived first by another road. When it happened a fourth time the boy grew cross, and said to himself, ‘It is no good going on; there seems to be a beardless man in every mill’; and he took his sack from his back, and made up his mind to grind his corn where he was.The beardless man finished grinding his own corn, and when he had done he said to the boy, who was beginning to grind his, ‘Suppose, sonny, we make a cake of what you have there.’Now the boy had been rather uneasy when he recollected his father’s words, but he thought to himself, ‘What is done cannot be undone,’ and answered, ‘Very well, so let it be.’Then the beardless one got up, threw the flour into the tub, and made a hole in the middle, telling the boy to fetch some water from the river in his two hands, to mix the cake. When the cake was ready for baking they put it on the fire, and covered it with hot ashes, till it was cooked through. Then they leaned it up against the wall, for it was too big to go into a cupboard, and the beardless one said to the boy:‘Look here, sonny: if we share this cake we shall neither of us have enough. Let us see who can tell the biggest lie, and the one who lies the best shall have the whole cake.’The boy, not knowing what else to do, answered, ‘All right; you begin.’So the beardless one began to lie with all his might, and when he was tired of inventing new lies the boy said to him, ‘My good fellow, if THAT is all you can do it is not much! Listen to me, and I will tell you a true story.‘In my youth, when I was an old man, we had a quantity of beehives. Every morning when I got up I counted them over, and it was quite easy to number the bees, but I never could reckon the hives properly. One day, as I was counting the bees, I discovered that my best bee was missing, and without losing a moment I saddled a cock and went out to look for him. I traced him as far as the shore, and knew that he had crossed the sea, and that I must follow. When I had reached the other side I found a man had harnessed my bee to a plough, and with his help was sowing millet seed.‘ “That is my bee!” I shouted. “Where did you get him from?” ‘ “Brother,” replied the man, “if he is yours, take him.” And he not only gave me back my bee, but a sack of millet seed into the bargain, because he had made use of my bee. Then I put the bag on my shoulders, took the saddle from the cock, and placed it on the back of the bee, which I mounted, leading the cock by a string, so that he should have a rest. As we were flying home over the sea one of the strings that held the bag of millet broke in two, and the sack dropped straight into the ocean. It was quite lost, of course, and there was no use thinking about it, and by the time we were safe back again night had come. I then got down from my bee, and let him loose, that he might get his supper, gave the cock some hay, and went to sleep myself. But when I awoke with the sun what a scene met my eyes! During the night wolves had come and had eaten my bee. And honey lay ankle-deep in the valley and knee-deep on the hills. Then I began to consider how I could best collect some, to take home with me.‘Now it happened that I had with me a small hatchet, and this I took to the wood, hoping to meet some animal which I could kill, whose skin I might turn into a bag. As I entered the forest I saw two roe-deer hopping on one foot, so I slew them with a single blow, and made three bags from their skins, all of which I filled with honey and placed on the back of the cock. At length I reached home, where I was told that my father had just been born, and that I must go at once to fetch some holy water to sprinkle him with. As I went I turned over in my mind if there was no way for me to get back my millet seed, which had dropped into the sea, and when I arrived at the place with the holy water I saw the seed had fallen on fruitful soil, and was growing before my eyes. And more than that, it was even cut by an invisible hand, and made into a cake.‘So I took the cake as well as the holy water, and was flying back with them over the sea, when there fell a great rain, and the sea was swollen, and swept away my millet cake. Ah, how vexed I was at its loss when I was safe on earth again.‘Suddenly I remembered that my hair was very long. If I stood it touched the ground, although if I was sitting it only reached my ears. I seized a knife and cut off a large lock, which I plaited together, and when night came tied it into a knot, and prepared to use it for a pillow. But what was I to do for a fire? A tinder box I had, but no wood. Then it occurred to me that I had stuck a needle in my clothes, so I took the needle and split it in pieces, and lit it, then laid myself down by the fire and went to sleep. But ill-luck still pursued me. While I was sleeping a spark from the fire lighted on the hair, which was burnt up in a moment. In despair I threw myself on the ground, and instantly sank in it as far as my waist. I struggled to get out, but only fell in further; so I ran to the house, seized a spade, dug myself out, and took home the holy water. On the way I noticed that the ripe fields were full of reapers, and suddenly the air became so frightfully hot that the men dropped down in a faint. Then I called to them, “Why don’t you bring out our mare, which is as tall as two days, and as broad as half a day, and make a shade for yourselves?” My father heard what I said and jumped quickly on the mare, and the reapers worked with a will in the shadow, while I snatched up a wooden pail to bring them some water to drink. When I got to the well everything was frozen hard, so in order to draw some water I had to take off my head and break the ice with it. As I drew near them, carrying the water, the reapers all cried out, “Why, what has become of your head?” I put up my hand and discovered that I really had no head, and that I must have left it in the well. I ran back to look for it, but found that meanwhile a fox which was passing by had pulled my head out of the water, and was tearing at my brains. I stole cautiously up to him, and gave him such a kick that he uttered a loud scream, and let fall a parchment on which was written, “The cake is mine, and the beardless one goes empty-handed.” ‘With these words the boy rose, took the cake, and went home, while the beardless one remained behind to swallow his disappointment.","['edge', 'wood', 'live', 'call', 'want', 'corn', 'ground', 'youth',

666,slavic,The Emperor Trojan's Goat's Ears,"There once lived an emperor whose name was Trojan. This emperor had goat’s ears, and he used to call in barber after barber to shave him. But whoever went in never came out again; for while the barber was shaving him, the emperor would ask what he observed uncommon in him, and when the barber would answer that he observed his goat’s ears, the Emperor Trojan would immediately cut him into pieces.At last it came to the turn of a certain barber to go, who feigned illness, and sent his apprentice instead. When the apprentice appeared before the emperor he was asked why his master did not come, and he answered, “Because he is ill.” Then the emperor sat down, and allowed the youth to shave him. As he shaved him the apprentice noticed the emperor’s goat’s ears, but when Trojan asked him what he had observed, he answered, “I have observed nothing.”Then the emperor gave him twelve ducats, and said to him,—“From this time forth you shall always come and shave me.”When the apprentice came home, his master asked him how he got on at the emperor’s, and the youth answered,—“All well; and the emperor has told me that I am to shave him in future.”Then he showed the twelve ducats he had received; but as to the emperor’s goat’s ears, of that he said nothing.From this time forth the apprentice went regularly to Trojan to shave him, and for each shaving he received twelve ducats; but he told no one that the emperor had goat’s ears.At last it began to worry and torment him that he dare tell no one his secret; and he became sick and began to pine away. His master, who could not fail to observe this, asked him what ailed him, and after much pressing the apprentice confessed that he had something on his heart which he dared not confide to any one, and he added,—”If I could only tell it to somebody, I should feel better at once.”Then said the master,—“Tell it to me, and I will faithfully keep it from everybody else; or if you fear to trust me with it, then go to the confessor and confide it to him; but if you will not do even that, then go into the fields outside the town, there dig a hole, thrust your head into it, and tell the earth three times what you know, then throw the mould in again and fill up the hole.”The apprentice chose the last course; went into the field outside the city, dug a hole, into which he thrust his head, and called out three times,—“The Emperor Trojan has goat’s ears!”Then he filled up the hole again, and with his mind quite relieved went home.When some time had passed by, there sprang an elder-tree out of this very hole, and three slender stems grew up, beautiful and straight as tapers. Some shepherds found this elder, cut off one of the stems, and made a pipe of it. But as soon as they began to blow into the new pipe, out burst the words:“The Emperor Trojan has goat’s ears!”The news of this strange occurrence spread immediately through the whole city, and at last the Emperor Trojan himself heard the children blowing on a pipe:“The Emperor Trojan has goat’s ears!”He sent instantly for the barber’s apprentice, and shouted to him,—“Heh! what is this you have been telling the people about me?”The poor youth began at once to explain that he had indeed noticed the emperor’s ears, but had never told a soul of it. The emperor tore his sabre out of its sheath to hew the apprentice down, at which the youth was so frightened that he told the whole story in its order: how he had confessed himself to the earth; how an elder-tree had sprang up on the very spot; and how, when a pipe was made of one of its stems, the tale was sounded in every direction.Then the emperor took the apprentice with him in a carriage to the place, to convince himself of the truth of the story; and when they arrived there they found there was only a single stem left. The Emperor Trojan ordered a pipe to be made out of this stem, that he might hear how it sounded. As soon as the pipe was ready, and one of them blew into it, out poured the words:“The Emperor Trojan has goat’s ears!”Then the emperor was convinced that nothing on this earth could be hidden, spared the barber apprentice’s life, and henceforth allowed any barber, without exception, to come and shave him.","['live', 'emperor', 'whose', 'name', 'trojan', 'emperor', 'goat', 'call', 'barber',

695,slavic,The Wonderful Birch,"Once upon a time there were a man and a woman, who had an only daughter. Now it happened that one of their sheep went astray, and they set out to look for it, and searched and searched, each in n different part of the wood. Then the good wife met a witch, who said to her:`If you spit, you miserable creature, if you spit into the sheath of my knife, or if you run between my legs, I shall change you into a black sheep.’The woman neither spat, nor did she run between her legs, but yet the witch changed her into a sheep. Then she made herself look exactly like the woman, and called out to the good man:`Ho, old man, halloa! I have found the sheep already!’The man thought the witch was really his wife, and he did not know that his wife was the sheep; so he went home with her, glad at heart because his sheep was found. When they were safe at home the witch said to the man:`Look here, old man, we must really kill that sheep lest it run away to the wood again.’The man, who was a peaceable quiet sort of fellow, made no objections, but simply said:`Good, let us do so.’The daughter, however, had overheard their talk, and she ran to the flock and lamented aloud:`Oh, dear little mother, they are going to slaughter you!’`Well, then, if they do slaughter me,’ was the black sheep’s answer, `eat you neither the meat nor the broth that is made of me, but gather all my bones, and bury them by the edge of the field.’Shortly after this they took the black sheep from the flock and slaughtered it. The witch made pease-soup of it, and set it before the daughter. But the girl remembered her mother’s warning. She did not touch the soup, but she carried the bones to the edge of the field and buried them there; and there sprang up on the spot a birch tree–a very lovely birch tree.Some time had passed away–who can tell how long they might have been living there?–when the witch, to whom a child had been born in the meantime, began to take an ill-will to the man’s daughter, and to torment her in all sorts of ways.Now it happened that a great festival was to be held at the palace, and the King had commanded that all the people should be invited, and that this proclamation should be made:`Come, people all! Poor and wretched, one and all! Blind and crippled though ye be, Mount your steeds or come by sea.’And so they drove into the King’s feast all the outcasts, and the maimed, and the halt, and the blind. In the good man’s house, too, preparations were made to go to the palace. The witch said to the man:`Go you on in front, old man, with our youngest; I will give the elder girl work to keep her from being dull in our absence.’So the man took the child and set out. But the witch kindled a fire on the hearth, threw a potful of barleycorns among the cinders, and said to the girl:`If you have not picked the barley out of the ashes, and put it all back in the pot before nightfall, I shall eat you up!’Then she hastened after the others, and the poor girl stayed at home and wept. She tried to be sure to pick up the grains of barley, but she soon saw how useless her labour was; and so she went in her sore trouble to the birch tree on her mother’s grave, and cried and cried, because her mother lay dead beneath the sod and could help her no longer. In the midst of her grief she suddenly heard her mother’s voice speak from the grave, and say to her:`Why do you weep, little daughter?’`The witch has scattered barleycorns on the hearth, and bid me pick them out of the ashes,’ said the girl; `that is why I weep, dear little mother.’`Do not weep,’ said her mother consolingly. `Break off one of my branches, and strike the hearth with it crosswise, and all will be put right.’ The girl did so. She struck the hearth with the birchen branch, and lo! the barleycorns flew into the pot, and the hearth was clean. Then she went back to the birch tree and laid the branch upon the grave. Then her mother bade her bathe on one side of the stem, dry herself on another, and dress on the third. When the girl had done all that, she had grown so lovely that no one on earth could rival her. Splendid clothing was given to her, and a horse, with hair partly of gold, partly of silver, and partly of something more precious still. The girl sprang into the saddle, and rode as swift as an arrow to the palace. As she turned into the courtyard of the castle the King’s son came out to meet her, tied her steed to a pillar, and led her in. He never left her side as they passed through the castle rooms; and all the people gazed at her, and wondered who the lovely maiden was, and from what castle she came; but no one knew her–no one knew anything about her. At the banquet the Prince invited her to sit next him in the place of honour; but the witch’s daughter gnawed the bones under the table. The Prince did not see her, and thinking it was a dog, he gave her such a push with his foot that her arm was broken. Are you not sorry for the witch’s daughter? It was not her fault that her mother was a witch.Towards evening the good man’s daughter thought it was time to go home; but as she went, her ring caught on the latch of the door, for the King’s son had had it smeared with tar. She did not take time to pull it off, but, hastily unfastening her horse from the pillar, she rode away beyond the castle walls as swift as an arrow. Arrived at home, she took off her clothes by the birch tree, left her horse standing there, and hastened to her place behind the stove. In a short time the man and the woman came home again too, and the witch said to the girl:`Ah! you poor thing, there you are to be sure! You don’t know what fine times we have had at the palace! The King’s son carried my daughter about, but the poor thing fell and broke her arm.’The girl knew well how matters really stood, but she pretended to know nothing about it, and sat dumb behind the stove.The next day they were invited again to the King’s banquet.`Hey! old man,’ said the witch, `get on your clothes as quick as you can; we are bidden to the feast. Take you the child; I will give the other one work, lest she weary.’She kindled the fire, threw a potful of hemp seed among the ashes, and said to the girl:`If you do not get this sorted, and all the seed back into the pot, I shall kill you!’The girl wept bitterly; then she went to the birch tree, washed herself on one side of it and dried herself on the other; and this time still finer clothes were given to her, and a very beautiful steed. She broke off a branch of the birch tree, struck the hearth with it, so that the seeds flew into the pot, and then hastened to the castle.Again the King’s son came out to meet her, tied her horse to a pillar, and led her into the banqueting hall. At the feast the girl sat next him in the place of honour, as she had done the day before. But the witch’s daughter gnawed bones under the table, and the Prince gave her a push by mistake, which broke her leg–he had never noticed her crawling about among the people’s feet. She was VERY unlucky!The good man’s daughter hastened home again betimes, but the King’s son had smeared the door-posts with tar, and the girl’s golden circlet stuck to it. She had not time to look for it, but sprang to the saddle and rode like an arrow to the birch tree. There she left her horse and her fine clothes, and said to her mother:`I have lost my circlet at the castle; the door-post was tarred, and it stuck fast.’`And even had you lost two of them,’ answered her mother, `I would give you finer ones.’Then the girl hastened home, and when her father came home from the feast with the witch, she was in her usual place behind the stove. Then the witch said to her:`You poor thing! what is there to see here compared with what WE have seen at the palace? The King’s son carried my daughter from one room to another; he let her fall, ’tis true, and my child’s foot was broken.’The man’s daughter held her peace all the time, and busied herself about the hearth.The night passed, and when the day began to dawn, the witch awakened her husband, crying:`Hi! get up, old man! We are bidden to the royal banquet.’So the old man got up. Then the witch gave him the child, saying:`Take you the little one; I will give the other girl work to do, else she will weary at home alone.’She did as usual. This time it was a dish of milk she poured upon the ashes, saying:`If you do not get all the milk into the dish again before I come home, you will suffer for it.’How frightened the girl was this time! She ran to the birch tree, and by its magic power her task was accomplished; and then she rode away to the palace as before. When she got to the courtyard she found the Prince waiting for her. He led her into the hall, where she was highly honoured; but the witch’s daughter sucked the bones under the table, and crouching at the people’s feet she got an eye knocked out, poor thing! Now no one knew any more than before about the good man’s daughter, no one knew whence she came; but the Prince had had the threshold smeared with tar, and as she fled her gold slippers stuck to it. She reached the birch tree, and laying aside her finery, she said:`Alas I dear little mother, I have lost my gold slippers!’`Let them be,’ was her mother’s reply; `if you need them I shall give you finer ones.’Scarcely was she in her usual place behind the stove when her father came home with the witch. Immediately the witch began to mock her, saying:`Ah! you poor thing, there is nothing for you to see here, and WE–ah: what great things we have seen at the palace! My little girl was carried about again, but had the ill-luck to fall and get her eye knocked out. You stupid thing, you, what do you know about anything?’`Yes, indeed, what can I know?’ replied the girl; `I had enough to do to get the hearth clean.’Now the Prince had kept all the things the girl had lost, and he soon set about finding the owner of them. For this purpose a great banquet was given on the fourth day, and all the people were invited to the palace. The witch got ready to go too. She tied a wooden beetle on where her child’s foot should have been, a log of wood instead of an arm, and stuck a bit of dirt in the empty socket for an eye, and took the child with her to the castle. When all the people were gathered together, the King’s son stepped in among the crowd and cried:`The maiden whose finger this ring slips over, whose head this golden hoop encircles, and whose foot this shoe fits, shall be my bride.’What a great trying on there was now among them all! The things would fit no one, however.`The cinder wench is not here,’ said the Prince at last; `go and fetch her, and let her try on the things.’So the girl was fetched, and the Prince was just going to hand the ornaments to her, when the witch held him back, saying:`Don’t give them to her; she soils everything with cinders; give them to my daughter rather.’Well, then the Prince gave the witch’s daughter the ring, and the woman filed and pared away at her daughter’s finger till the ring fitted. It was the same with the circlet and the shoes of gold. The witch would not allow them to be handed to the cinder wench; she worked at her own daughter’s head and feet till she got the things forced on. What was to be done now? The Prince had to take the witch’s daughter for his bride whether he would or no; he sneaked away to her father’s house with her, however, for he was ashamed to hold the wedding festivities at the palace with so strange a bride. Some days passed, and at last he had to take his bride home to the palace, and he got ready to do so. Just as they were taking leave, the kitchen wench sprang down from her place by the stove, on the pretext of fetching something from the cowhouse, and in going by she whispered in the Prince’s ear as he stood in the yard:`Alas! dear Prince, do not rob me of my silver and my gold.’Thereupon the King’s son recognised the cinder wench; so he took both the girls with him, and set out. After they had gone some little way they came to the bank of a river, and the Prince threw the witch’s daughter across to serve as a bridge, and so got over with the cinder wench. There lay the witch’s daughter then, like a bridge over the river, and could not stir, though her heart was consumed with grief. No help was near, so she cried at last in her anguish:`May there grow a golden hemlock out of my body! perhaps my mother will know me by that token.’Scarcely had she spoken when a golden hemlock sprang up from her, and stood upon the bridge.Now, as soon as the Prince had got rid of the witch’s daughter he greeted the cinder wench as his bride, and they wandered together to the birch tree which grew upon the mother’s grave. There they received all sorts of treasures and riches, three sacks full of gold, and as much silver, and a splendid steed, which bore them home to the palace. There they lived a long time together, and the young wife bore a son to the Prince. Immediately word was brought to the witch that her daughter had borne a son–for they all believed the young King’s wife to be the witch’s daughter.`So, so,’ said the witch to herself; `I had better away with my gift for the infant, then.’And so saying she set out. Thus it happened that she came to the bank of the river, and there she saw the beautiful golden hemlock growing in the middle of the bridge, and when she began to cut it down to take to her grandchild, she heard a voice moaning:`Alas! dear mother, do not cut me so!’`Are you here?’ demanded the witch.`Indeed I am, dear little mother,’ answered the daughter `They threw me across the river to make a bridge of me.’In a moment the witch had the bridge shivered to atoms, and then she hastened away to the palace. Stepping up to the young Queen’s bed, she began to try her magic arts upon her, saying:`Spit, you wretch, on the blade of my knife; bewitch my knife’s blade for me, and I shall change you into a reindeer of the forest.’`Are you there again to bring trouble upon me?’ said the young woman.She neither spat nor did anything else, but still the witch changed her into a reindeer, and smuggled her own daughter into her place as the Prince’s wife. But now the child grew restless and cried, because it missed its mother’s care. They took it to the court, and tried to pacify it in every conceivable way, but its crying never ceased.`What makes the child so restless?’ asked the Prince, and he went to a wise widow woman to ask her advice.`Ay, ay, your own wife is not at home,’ said the widow woman; `she is living like a reindeer in the wood; you have the witch’s daughter for a wife now, and the witch herself for a mother-in- law.’`Is there any way of getting my own wife back from the wood again?’ asked the Prince.`Give me the child,’ answered the widow woman. `I’ll take it with me to-morrow when I go to drive the cows to the wood. I’ll make a rustling among the birch leaves and a trembling among the aspens–perhaps the boy will grow quiet when he hears it.’`Yes, take the child away, take it to the wood with you to quiet it,’ said the Prince, and led the widow woman into the castle.`How now? you are going to send the child away to the wood?’ said the witch in a suspicious tone, and tried to interfere.But the King’s son stood firm by what he had commanded, and said:`Carry the child about the wood; perhaps that will pacify it.’So the widow woman took the child to the wood. She came to the edge of a marsh, and seeing a herd of reindeer there, she began all at once to sing–`Little Bright-eyes, little Redskin, Come nurse the child you bore! That bloodthirsty monster, That man-eater grim, Shall nurse him, shall tend him no more. They may threaten and force as they will, He turns from her, shrinks from her still,’and immediately the reindeer drew near, and nursed and tended the child the whole day long; but at nightfall it had to follow the herd, and said to the widow woman:`Bring me the child to-morrow, and again the following day; after that I must wander with the herd far away to other lands.’The following morning the widow woman went back to the castle to fetch the child. The witch interfered, of course, but the Prince said:`Take it, and carry it about in the open air; the boy is quieter at night, to be sure, when he has been in the wood all day.’So the widow took the child in her arms, and carried it to the marsh in the forest. There she sang as on the preceding day–`Little Bright-eyes, little Redskin, Come nurse the child you bore! That bloodthirsty monster, That man-eater grim, Shall nurse him, shall tend him no more. They may threaten and force as they will, He turns from her, shrinks from her still,’and immediately the reindeer left the herd and came to the child, and tended it as on the day before. And so it was that the child throve, till not a finer boy was to be seen anywhere. But the King’s son had been pondering over all these things, and he said to the widow woman:`Is there no way of changing the reindeer into a human being again?’`I don’t rightly know,’ was her answer. `Come to the wood with me, however; when the woman puts off her reindeer skin I shall comb her head for her; whilst I am doing so you must burn the skin.’Thereupon they both went to the wood with the child; scarcely were they there when the reindeer appeared and nursed the child as before. Then the widow woman said to the reindeer:`Since you are going far away to-morrow, and I shall not see you again, let me comb your head for the last time, as a remembrance of you.’Good; the young woman stript off the reindeer skin, and let the widow woman do as she wished. In the meantime the King’s son threw the reindeer skin into the fire unobserved.`What smells of singeing here?’ asked the young woman, and looking round she saw her own husband. `Woe is me! you have burnt my skin. Why did you do that?’`To give you back your human form again.’`Alack-a-day! I have nothing to cover me now, poor creature that I am!’ cried the young woman, and transformed herself first into a distaff, then into a wooden beetle, then into a spindle, and into all imaginable shapes. But all these shapes the King’s son went on destroying till she stood before him in human form again.Alas! wherefore take me home with you again,’ cried the young woman, `since the witch is sure to eat me up?’`She will not eat you up,’ answered her husband; and they started for home with the child.But when the witch wife saw them she ran away with her daughter, and if she has not stopped she is running still, though at a great age. And the Prince, and his wife, and the baby lived happy ever afterwards.","['upon', 'time', 'woman', 'daughter', 'happen', 'sheep', 'astray', 'look', 'search', 'search', 'different', 'part', 'wood',

747,slavic,The Dwarf with the Long Beard,"In a far distant land there reigned a king, and he had an only daughter who was so very beautiful that no one in the whole kingdom could be compared to her. She was known as Princess Pietnotka, and the fame of her beauty spread far and wide. There were many princes among her suitors, but her choice fell upon Prince Dobrotek. She obtained her father’s consent to their marriage, and then, attended by a numerous suite, set off with her lover for the church, having first, as was the custom, received her royal parent’s blessing. Most of the princes who had been unsuccessful in their wooing of Pietnotka returned disappointed to their own kingdoms: but one of them, a dwarf only seven inches high, with an enormous hump on his back and a beard seven feet long, who was a powerful prince and magician, was so enraged that he determined to have his revenge. So he changed himself into a whirlwind and lay in wait to receive the princess. When the wedding procession was about to enter the church the air was suddenly filled with a blinding cloud of dust, and Pietnotka was borne up high as the highest clouds, and then right down to an underground palace. There the dwarf, for it was he who had worked this spell, disappeared, leaving her in a lifeless condition.When she opened her eyes she found herself in such a magnificent apartment that she imagined some king must have run away with her. She got up and began to walk about, when lo! as if by some unseen hand the table was laden with gold and silver dishes, filled with cakes of every kind. They looked so tempting, that in spite of her grief she could not resist tasting, and she continued to eat until she was more than satisfied. She returned to the sofa and lay down to rest, but being unable to sleep, she looked first at the door, and then at the lamp burning on the table, then at the door again, and then back to the lamp. Suddenly the door opened of itself, giving entrance to four negroes fully armed, and bearing a golden throne, upon which was seated the Dwarf with the Long Beard. He came close up to the sofa and attempted to kiss the princess, but she struck him such a blow in the face that a thousand stars swam before his eyes, and a thousand bells rang in his ears; upon which he gave such a shout, that the palace walls trembled. Yet his love for her was so great that he did his best not to show his anger, and turned away as if to leave her. But his feet became entangled in his long beard, and he fell down, dropping a cap he was carrying in his hand. Now this cap had the power of making its wearer invisible. The negroes hastened up to their master, and placing him on his throne bore him out.Directly the princess found herself alone she jumped off the sofa, locked the door, and picking up the cap ran to a mirror to try it on and see how it suited her. Imagine her amazement when looking in the glass she saw—nothing at all! She took off the cap, and behold, she was there again as large as life. She soon found out what sort of cap it was, and rejoicing in the possession of such a marvel, put it on her head again and began to walk about the room. Soon the door was burst violently open, and the dwarf entered with his beard tied up. But he found neither the princess nor the cap, and so came to the conclusion that she had taken it. In a great rage he began to search high and low; he looked under all the furniture, behind the curtains, and even beneath the carpets, but it was all in vain. Meanwhile the princess, still invisible, had left the palace and run into the garden, which was very large and beautiful. There she lived at her ease, eating the delicious fruit, drinking water from the fountain, and enjoying the helpless fury of the dwarf, who sought her untiringly. Sometimes she would throw the fruit-stones in his face, or take off the cap and show herself for an instant: then she would put it on again, and laugh merrily at his rage.One day, while playing this game, the cap caught in the branches of a gooseberry bush. The dwarf seeing this at once ran up, seized the princess in one hand and the cap in the other, and was about to carry both off when the sound of a war-trumpet was heard.The dwarf trembled with rage and muttered a thousand curses. He breathed on the princess to send her to sleep, covered her with the invisible cap, and seizing a double-bladed sword, rose up in the air as high as the clouds, so that he might fall upon his assailant and kill him at one stroke. We shall now see with whom he had to deal.After the hurricane had upset the wedding procession and carried off the princess, there arose a great tumult among those at court. The king, the princess’s attendants, and Prince Dobrotek sought her in every direction, calling her by name, and making inquiries of every one they met. At last, the king in despair declared that if Prince Dobrotek did not bring back his daughter, he would destroy his kingdom and have him killed. And to the other princes present he promised that whosoever among them should bring Pietnotka back to him should have her for his wife and receive half of the kingdom. Whereupon they all mounted their horses without loss of time and dispersed in every direction.Prince Dobrotek, overpowered with grief and dismay, travelled three days without eating, drinking, or sleeping. On the evening of the third day he was quite worn-out with fatigue, and stopping his horse in a field, got down to rest for a short time. Suddenly he heard cries, as of something in pain, and looking round saw an enormous owl tearing a hare with its claws. The prince laid hold of the first hard thing that came to his hand; he imagined it to be a stone, but it was really a skull, and aiming it at the owl, killed the bird with the first blow. The rescued hare ran up to him and gratefully licked his hands, after which it ran away: but the human skull spoke to him and said, “Prince Dobrotek, accept my grateful thanks for the good turn you have done me. I belonged to an unhappy man who took his own life, and for this crime of suicide I have been condemned to roll in the mud until I was the means of saving the life of one of God’s creatures. I have been kicked about for seven hundred and seventy years, crumbling miserably on the earth, and without exciting the compassion of a single individual. You have been the means of setting me free by making use of me to save the life of that poor hare. In return for this kindness I will teach you how to call to your aid a most marvellous horse, who during my life belonged to me. He will be able to help you in a thousand ways, and when in need of him you have only to walk out on the moorland without once looking behind you, and to say:‘Dappled Horse with Mane of Gold,Horse of Wonder! Come to me.Walk not the earth, for I am toldYou fly like birds o’er land and sea.’Finish your work of mercy by burying me here, so that I may be at rest until the day of judgment. Then depart in peace and be of good cheer.”The prince dug a hole at the foot of a tree, and reverently buried the skull, repeating over it the prayers for the dead. Just as he finished he saw a small blue flame come out of the skull and fly towards heaven: it was the soul of the dead man on its way to the angels.The prince made the sign of the cross and resumed his journey. When he had gone some way along the moorland he stopped, and without looking back tried the effect of the magic words, saying:“Dappled Horse with Mane of Gold,Horse of Wonder! Come to me.Walk not the earth, for I am toldYou fly like birds o’er land and sea.”Then amid flash of lightning and roll of thunder appeared the horse. A horse, do I say? Why, he was a miracle of wonder. He was light as air, with dappled coat and golden mane. Flames came from his nostrils and sparks from his eyes. Volumes of steam rolled from his mouth and clouds of smoke issued from his ears. He stopped before the prince, and said in a human voice, “What are your orders, Prince Dobrotek?”“I am in great trouble,” answered the prince, “and shall be glad if you can help me.” Then he told all that had happened.And the horse said, “Enter in at my left ear, and come out at my right.”The prince obeyed, and came out at the right ear clad in a suit of splendid armour. His gilded cuirass, his steel helmet inlaid with gold, and his sword and club made of him a complete warrior. Still more, he felt himself endowed with superhuman strength and bravery. When he stamped his foot and shouted the earth trembled and gave forth a sound like thunder, the very leaves fell from the trees.“What must we do? Where are we to go?” he asked.The horse replied, “Your bride, Princess Pietnotka, has been carried off by the Dwarf with the Long Beard, whose hump weighs two hundred and eighty pounds. This powerful magician must be defeated, but he lives a long way from here, and nothing can touch or wound him except the sharp smiting sword that belongs to his own brother, a monster with the head and eyes of a basilisk. We must first attack the brother.”Prince Dobrotek leaped on to the dappled horse, which was covered with golden trappings, and they set off immediately, clearing mountains, penetrating forests, crossing rivers; and so light was the steed’s step that he galloped over the grass without bending a single blade, and along sandy roads without raising a grain of dust. At last they reached a vast plain, strewn with human bones. They stopped in front of a huge moving mountain, and the horse said:“Prince, this moving mountain that you see before you is the head of the Monster with Basilisk Eyes, and the bones that whiten the ground are the skeletons of his victims, so beware of the eyes that deal death. The heat of the midday sun has made the giant sleep, and the sword with the never-failing blade lies there before him. Bend down and lie along my neck until we are near enough, then seize the sword and you have nothing more to fear. For, without the sword, not only will the monster be unable to harm you, but he himself will be completely at your mercy.”The horse then noiselessly approached the huge creature, upon which the prince bent down, and quickly picked up the sword. Then, raising himself on his steed’s back, he gave a “Hurrah!” loud enough to wake the dead. The giant lifted his head, yawned, and turned his bloodthirsty eyes upon the prince; but seeing the sword in his hand he became quiet, and said, “Knight, is it weariness of life that brings you here?”“Boast not,” replied the prince, “you are in my power. Your glance has already lost its magic charm, and you will soon have to die by this sword. But first tell me who you are.”“It is true, prince, I am in your hands, but be generous, I deserve your pity. I am a knight of the race of giants, and if it were not for the wickedness of my brother I should have lived in peace. He is the horrible dwarf with the great hump and the beard seven feet long. He was jealous of my fine figure, and tried to do me an injury. You must know that all his strength, which is extraordinary, lies in his beard, and it can only be cut off by the sword you hold in your hand. One day he came to me and said, ‘Dear brother, I pray you help me to discover the sharp smiting sword that has been hidden in the earth by a magician. He is our enemy, and he alone can destroy us both.’ Fool that I was, I believed him, and by means of a large oak tree, raked up the mountain and found the sword. Then we disputed as to which of us should have it, and at last my brother suggested that we should cease quarrelling and decide by lot. ‘Let us each put an ear to the ground, and the sword shall belong to him who first hears the bells of yonder church,’ said he. I placed my ear to the ground at once, and my brother treacherously cut off my head with the sword. My body, left unburied, became a great mountain, which is now overgrown with forests. As for my head, it is full of a life and strength proof against all dangers, and has remained here ever since to frighten all who attempt to take away the sword. Now, prince, I beg of you, use the sword to cut off the beard of my wicked brother; kill him, and return here to put an end to me: I shall die happy if I die avenged.”“That you shall be, and very soon, I promise you,” replied his listener.The prince bade the Dappled Horse with Golden Mane carry him to the kingdom of the Dwarf with the Long Beard. They reached the garden gate at the very moment when the dwarf had caught sight of Princess Pietnotka and was running after her. The war-trumpet, challenging him to fight, had obliged him to leave her, which he did, having first put on her head the invisible cap.While the prince was awaiting the answer to his challenge he heard a great noise in the clouds, and looking up saw the dwarf preparing to aim at him from a great height. But he missed his aim and fell to the ground so heavily that his body was half buried in the earth. The prince seized him by the beard, which he at once cut off with the sharp smiting sword.Then he fastened the dwarf to the saddle, put the beard in his helmet, and entered the palace. When the servants saw that he had really got possession of the terrible beard, they opened all the doors to give him entrance. Without losing a moment he began his search for Princess Pietnotka. For a long time he was unsuccessful, and was almost in despair when he came across her accidentally, and, without knowing it, knocked off the invisible cap. He saw his lovely bride sound asleep, and being unable to wake her he put the cap in his pocket, took her in his arms, and, mounting his steed, set off to return to the Monster with the Basilisk Eyes. The giant swallowed the dwarf at one mouthful, and the prince cut the monster’s head up into a thousand pieces, which he scattered all over the plain.He then resumed his journey, and on coming to the moorland the dappled horse stopped short and said, “Prince, here for the present we must take leave of each other. You are not far from home, your own horse awaits you; but before leaving, enter in at my right ear and come out at my left.”The prince did so, and came out without his armour, and clad as when Pietnotka left him.The dappled horse vanished, and Dobrotek whistled to his own horse, who ran up, quite pleased to see him again. They immediately set off for the king’s palace.But night came on before they reached the end of their journey.The prince laid the sleeping maiden on the grass, and, covering her up carefully to keep her warm, he himself fell fast asleep. By chance, a knight, one of her suitors, passed that way. Seeing Dobrotek asleep he drew his sword and stabbed him; then he lifted the princess on his horse and soon reached the king’s palace, where he addressed Pietnotka’s father in these words: “Here is your daughter, whom I now claim as my wife, for it is I who have restored her to you. She was carried off by a terrible sorcerer who fought with me three days and three nights. But I conquered him, and I have brought you the princess safely back.”The king was overjoyed at seeing her again, but finding that his tenderest efforts were powerless to awake her, he wanted to know the reason of it.“That I cannot tell you,” replied the impostor; “you see her as I found her myself.”Meanwhile, poor Prince Dobrotek, seriously wounded, was slowly recovering consciousness, but he felt so weak that he could hardly utter these words:“Come, Magic Horse with Mane of Gold,Come, Dappled Horse, O come to me.Fly like the birds as you did of old,As flashes of lightning o’er land and sea.”Instantly a bright cloud appeared, and from the midst thereof stepped the magic horse. As he already knew all that had happened, he dashed off immediately to the Mountain of Eternal Life. Thence he drew the three kinds of water: the Water that gives Life, the Water that Cures, and the Water that Strengthens. Returning to the prince, he sprinkled him first with the Life-giving Water, and instantly the body, which had become cold, was warm again and the blood began to circulate. The Water that Cures healed the wound, and the Strength-giving Water had such an effect upon him that he opened his eyes and cried out, “Oh, how well I have slept.”“You were already sleeping the eternal sleep,” replied the dappled horse. “One of your rivals stabbed you mortally, and carried off Pietnotka, whom he pretends to have rescued. But do not worry yourself, she still sleeps, and none can arouse her but you, and this you must do by touching her with the dwarf’s beard. Go now, and be happy.”The brave steed disappeared in a whirlwind, and Prince Dobrotek proceeded on his way. On drawing near the capital he saw it surrounded by a large foreign army; part of it was already taken, and the inhabitants seemed to be begging for mercy. The prince put on his invisible cap, and began to strike right and left with the sharp smiting sword. With such fury did he attack the enemy that they fell dead on all sides, like felled trees. When he had thus destroyed the whole army he went, still invisible, into the palace, where he heard the king express the utmost astonishment that the enemy had retired without fighting.“Where then is the brave warrior who has saved us?” said his majesty aloud.Every one was silent, when Dobrotek took off his magic cap, and falling on his knees before the monarch, said: “It is I, my king and father, who have routed and destroyed the enemy. It is I who saved the princess, my bride. While on my way back with her I was treacherously killed by my rival, who has represented himself to you as her rescuer, but he has deceived you. Lead me to the princess, that I may awaken her.”On hearing these words the impostor ran away as quickly as possible, and Dobrotek approached the sleeping maiden. He just touched her brow with the dwarf’s beard, upon which she opened her eyes, smiled, and seemed to ask where she was.The king, overcome with joy, kissed her fondly, and the same evening she was married to the devoted Prince Dobrotek. The king himself led her to the altar, and to his son-in-law he gave half his kingdom. So splendid was the wedding banquet, that eye has never seen, nor ear ever heard of its equal.","['distant', 'land', 'reign', 'king', 'daughter', 'beautiful', 'whole', 'kingdom', 'could', 'compare',

752,slavic,Unlooked-For Prince,"A long time ago there lived a king and queen who had no children, although they both wished very much for a little son. They tried not to let each other see how unhappy they were, and pretended to take pleasure in hunting and hawking and all sorts of other sports; but at length the king could bear it no longer, and declared that he must go and visit the furthest corners of his kingdom, and that it would be many months before he should return to his capital.By that time he hoped he would have so many things to think about that he would have forgotten to trouble about the little son who never came.The country the king reigned over was very large, and full of high, stony mountains and sandy deserts, so that it was not at all easy to go from one place to another. One day the king had wandered out alone, meaning to go only a little distance, but everything looked so alike he could not make out the path by which he had come. He walked on and on for hours, the sun beating hotly on his head, and his legs trembling under him, and he might have died of thirst if he had not suddenly stumbled on a little well, which looked as if it had been newly dug. On the surface floated a silver cup with a golden handle, but as it bobbed about whenever the king tried to seize it, he was too thirsty to wait any longer and knelt down and drank his fill.When he had finished he began to rise from his knees, but somehow his beard seemed to have stuck fast in the water, and with all his efforts he could not pull it out. After two or three jerks to his head, which only hurt him without doing any good, he called out angrily, ‘Let go at once! Who is holding me?’‘It is I, the King Kostiei,’ said a voice from the well, and looking up through the water was a little man with green eyes and a big head. ‘You have drunk from my spring, and I shall not let you go until you promise to give me the most precious thing your palace contains, which was not there when you left it.’Now the only thing that the king much cared for in his palace was the queen herself, and as she was weeping bitterly on a pile of cushions in the great hall when he had ridden away, he knew that Kostiei’s words could not apply to her. So he cheerfully gave the promise asked for by the ugly little man, and in the twinkling of an eye, man, spring, and cup had disappeared, and the king was left kneeling on the dry sand, wondering if it was all a dream. But as he felt much stronger and better he made up his mind that this strange adventure must really have happened, and he sprang on his horse and rode off with a light heart to look for his companions.In a few weeks they began to set out on their return home, which they reached one hot day, eight months after they had all left. The king was greatly beloved by his people, and crowds lined the roads, shouting and waving their hats as the procession passed along. On the steps of the palace stood the queen, with a splendid golden cushion in her arms, and on the cushion the most beautiful boy that ever was seen, wrapped about in a cloud of lace. In a moment Kostiei’s words rushed into the king’s mind, and he began to weep bitterly, to the surprise of everybody, who had expected him nearly to die of joy at the sight of his son. But try as he would and work as hard as he might he could never forget his promise, and every time he let the baby out of his sight he thought that he had seen it for the last time.However, years passed on and the prince grew first into a big boy, and then into a fine young man. Kostiei made no sign, and gradually even the anxious king thought less and less about him, and in the end forgot him altogether.There was no family in the whole kingdom happier than the king and queen and prince, until one day when the youth met a little old man as he was hunting in a lonely part of the woods. ‘How are you my unlooked-for Prince?’ he said. ‘You kept them waiting a good long time!’‘And who are you?’ asked the prince.‘You will know soon enough. When you go home give my compliments to your father and tell him that I wish he would square accounts with me. If he neglects to pay his debts he will bitterly repent it.’So saying the old man disappeared, and the prince returned to the palace and told his father what had happened.The king turned pale and explained to his son the terrible story.‘Do not grieve over it, father,’ answered the prince. ‘It is nothing so dreadful after all! I will find some way to force Kostiei to give up his rights over me. But if I do not come back in a year’s time, you must give up all hopes of ever seeing me.’Then the prince began to prepare for his journey. His father gave him a complete suit of steel armour, a sword, and a horse, while his mother hung round his neck a cross of gold. So, kissing him tenderly, with many tears they let him go.He rode steadily on for three days, and at sunset on the fourth day he found himself on the seashore. On the sand before him lay twelve white dresses, dazzling as the snow, yet as far as his eyes could reach there was no one in sight to whom they could belong. Curious to see what would happen, he took up one of the garments, and leaving his horse loose, to wander about the adjoining fields, he hid himself among some willows and waited. In a few minutes a flock of geese which had been paddling about in the sea approached the shore, and put on the dresses, struck the sand with their feet and were transformed in the twinkling of an eye into eleven beautiful young girls, who flew away as fast as they could. The twelfth and youngest remained in the water, stretching out her long white neck and looking about her anxiously. Suddenly, among the willows, she perceived the king’s son, and called out to him with a human voice:‘Oh Prince, give me back my dress, and I shall be for ever grateful to you.’The prince hastened to lay the dress on the sand, and walked away. When the maiden had thrown off the goose-skin and quickly put on her proper clothes, she came towards him and he saw that none had ever seen or told of such beauty as hers. She blushed and held out her hand, saying to him in a soft voice:‘I thank you, noble Prince, for having granted my request. I am the youngest daughter of Kostiei the immortal, who has twelve daughters and rules over the kingdoms under the earth. Long time my father has waited for you, and great is his anger. But trouble not yourself and fear nothing, only do as I bid you. When you see the King Kostiei, fall straightway upon your knees and heed neither his threats nor his cry, but draw near to him boldly. That which will happen after, you will know in time. Now let us go.’At these words she struck the ground with her foot and a gulf opened, down which they went right into the heart of the earth. In a short time they reached Kostiei’s palace, which gives light, with a light brighter than the sun, to the dark kingdoms below. And the prince, as he had been bidden, entered boldly into the hall.Kostiei, with a shining crown upon his head, sat in the centre upon a golden throne. His green eyes glittered like glass, his hands were as the claws of a crab. When he caught sight of the prince he uttered piercing yells, which shook the walls of the palace. The prince took no notice, but continued his advance on his knees towards the throne. When he had almost reached it, the king broke out into a laugh and said:‘It has been very lucky for you that you have been able to make me laugh. Stay with us in our underground empire, only first you will have to do three things. To-night it is late. Go to sleep; to-morrow I will tell you.’Early the following morning the prince received a message that Kostiei was ready to see him. He got up and dressed, and hastened to the presence chamber, where the little king was seated on his throne. When the prince appeared, bowing low before him, Kostiei began:‘Now, Prince, this is what you have to do. By to-night you must build me a marble palace, with windows of crystal and a roof of gold. It is to stand in the middle of a great park, full of streams and lakes. If you are able to build it you shall be my friend. If not, off with your head.’The prince listened in silence to this startling speech, and then returning to his room set himself to think about the certain death that awaited him. He was quite absorbed in these thoughts, when suddenly a bee flew against the window and tapped, saying, ‘Let me come in.’ He rose and opened the window, and there stood before him the youngest princess.‘What are you dreaming about, Prince?’‘I was dreaming of your father, who has planned my death.’‘Fear nothing. You may sleep in peace, and to-morrow morning when you awake you will find the palace all ready.’What she said, she did. The next morning when the prince left his room he saw before him a palace more beautiful than his fancy had ever pictured. Kostiei for his part could hardly believe his eyes, and pondered deeply how it had got there.‘Well, this time you have certainly won; but you are not going to be let off so easily. To-morrow all my twelve daughters shall stand in a row before you, and if you cannot tell me which of them is the youngest, off goes your head.’‘What! Not recognise the youngest princess!’ said the Prince to himself, as he entered his room, ‘a likely story!’‘It is such a difficult matter that you will never be able to do it without my help,’ replied the bee, who was buzzing about the ceiling. ‘We are all so exactly alike, that even our father scarcely knows the difference between us.’‘Then what must I do?’‘This. The youngest is she who will have a ladybird on her eyelid. Be very careful. Now good-bye.’Next morning King Kostiei again sent for the prince. The young princesses were all drawn up in a row, dressed precisely in the same manner, and with their eyes all cast down. As the prince looked at them, he was amazed at their likeness. Twice he walked along the line, without being able to detect the sign agreed upon. The third time his heart beat fast at the sight of a tiny speck upon the eyelid of one of the girls.‘This one is the youngest,’ he said.‘How in the world did you guess?’ cried Kostiei in a fury. ‘There is some jugglery about it! But you are not going to escape me so easily. In three hours you shall come here and give me another proof of your cleverness. I shall set alight a handful of straw, and before it is burnt up you will have turned it into a pair of boots. If not, off goes your head.’So the prince returned sadly into his room, but the bee was there before him.‘Why do you look so melancholy, my handsome Prince?’‘How can I help looking melancholy when your father has ordered me to make him a pair of boots? Does he take me for a shoemaker?’‘What do you think of doing?’‘Not of making boots, at any rate! I am not afraid of death. One can only die once after all.’‘No, Prince, you shall not die. I will try to save you. And we will fly together or die together.’As she spoke she spat upon the ground, and then drawing the prince after her out of the room, she locked the door behind her and threw away the key. Holding each other tight by the hand, they made their way up into the sunlight, and found themselves by the side of the same sea, while the prince’s horse was still quietly feeding in the neighbouring meadow. The moment he saw his master, the horse whinnied and galloped towards him. Without losing an instant the prince sprang into the saddle, swung the princess behind him, and away they went like an arrow from a bow.When the hour arrived which Kostiei had fixed for the prince’s last trial, and there were no signs of him, the king sent to his room to ask why he delayed so long. The servants, finding the door locked, knocked loudly and received for answer, ‘In one moment.’ It was the spittle, which was imitating the voice of the prince.The answer was taken back to Kostiei. He waited; still no prince. He sent the servants back again, and the same voice replied, ‘Immediately.’‘He is making fun of me!’ shrieked Kostiei in a rage. ‘Break in the door, and bring him to me!’The servants hurried to do his bidding. The door was broken open. Nobody inside; but just the spittle in fits of laughter! Kostiei was beside himself with rage, and commanded his guards to ride after the fugitives. If the guards returned without the fugitives, their heads should pay for it.By this time the prince and princess had got a good start, and were feeling quite happy, when suddenly they heard the sound of a gallop far behind them. The prince sprang from the saddle, and laid his ear to the ground.‘They are pursuing us,’ he said.‘Then there is no time to be lost,’ answered the princess; and as she spoke she changed herself into a river, the prince into a bridge, the horse into a crow, and divided the wide road beyond the bridge into three little ones. When the soldiers came up to the bridge, they paused uncertainly. How were they to know which of the three roads the fugitives had taken? They gave it up in despair and returned in trembling to Kostiei.‘Idiots!’ he exclaimed, in a passion. ‘They were the bridge and the river, of course! Do you mean to say you never thought of that? Go back at once!’ and off they galloped like lightning.But time had been lost, and the prince and princess were far on their way.‘I hear a horse,’ cried the princess.The prince jumped down and laid his ear to the ground.‘Yes,’ he said, ‘they are not far off now.’In an instant prince, princess, and horse had all disappeared, and instead was a dense forest, crossed and recrossed by countless paths. Kostiei’s soldiers dashed hastily into the forest, believing they saw before them the flying horse with its double burden. They seemed close upon them, when suddenly horse, wood, everything disappeared, and they found themselves at the place where they started. There was nothing for it but to return to Kostiei, and tell him of this fresh disaster.‘A horse! a horse!’ cried the king. ‘I will go after them myself. This time they shall not escape.’ And he galloped off, foaming with anger.‘I think I hear someone pursuing us,’ said the princess‘Yes, so do I.’‘And this time it is Kostiei himself. But his power only reaches as far as the first church, and he can go no farther. Give me your golden cross.’ So the prince unfastened the cross which was his mother’s gift, and the princess hastily changed herself into a church, the prince into a priest, and the horse into a belfry.It was hardly done when Kostiei came up.‘Greeting, monk. Have you seen some travellers on horseback pass this way?’‘Yes, the prince and Kostiei’s daughter have just gone by. They have entered the church, and told me to give you their greetings if I met you.’Then Kostiei knew that he had been hopelessly beaten, and the prince and princess continued their journey without any more adventures.","['long', 'time', 'live', 'king', 'queen', 'child', 'although', 'wish', 'much', 'little', 'unhappy', 'pretend', 'take', 'pleasure', 'hunt', 'hawk', 'sort', 'sport', 'length',

764,slavic,"Cudgel, Bestir Yourself!","A cobbler was busying himself on Saturday with mending old shoes, that he might be able to go to church on Sunday. He worked till late in the evening, and, having finished his work, early in the morning dressed himself, and took his book to service. In church he heard this doctrine, that if any one dedicates his property to the church, God will recompense him a hundredfold in another form. And as he was poor, he therefore determined to sell his cottage and goods and take the whole price to the priest at the church. He went home and told his wife of his intentions; and in a few days the money was in the hands of the parson.But day passed after day, and nothing was to be seen of a recompense. At last, when hunger sorely tried the cobbler, he dressed himself like an old beggar and went to seek for the Lord God. After wandering a couple of days he met with an old shepherd, who was pasturing a large flock of lambs. And as he was very hungry, he made up his mind to go up to the old shepherd, and ask him to give him a little to eat out of his dinner-basket.  During the meal he related all that he had done, and how it was then going with him.The old shepherd compassionated the poor cobbler, and gave him a lamb, which scattered ducats at every call: ‘Lamb, shake yourself!’ but gave it him under the condition, that in one village, through which he was obliged to pass, he was not to enter the house of his old gossip. He laid the lamb on his shoulder with great joy, thanked the old man for it, and started with speed on his way home to rejoice his wife and children. When he got behind the hill, he began to distrust the words of the old shepherd, for he could not get it into his head that an ordinary lamb would scatter ducats. Wishing, therefore, to assure himself of their truth, he placed the lamb on the ground and uttered the old man’s words: ‘Lamb, shake yourself!’ and when at the selfsame moment he espied ducats round the lamb’s feet, he considered himself the most fortunate man in the whole world.Without delay he put the lamb on his back, and went on towards home. But when he went past his gossip’s tavern, she besought him to pay her a visit, for they had not seen each other for a very long time. The cobbler at first hesitated a little, but wishing to show that he had ducats in his pocket, and that he had met with such good fortune, he went into the tavern; and, after first giving into her charge his present from the old man, with these words, But don’t say to him, “Lamb, shake yourself!’ went to the table and drank off a noggin of brandy. But his gossip, a knavish old woman, bethought herself at once that there must be some secret lying in these words. She, therefore, took the lamb into another room, and when she was there by herself, said to the lamb: ‘Lamb, shake yourself!’ when she saw that he scattered ducats she began to consider how to cheat her gossip.After a short time she determined to make the cobbler drunk, to detain him all night at her house, and next day, early, to give him instead of his lamb another like it out of her own flock; which was effected according to her intention. Well, early in the morning the cobbler took the lamb on his shoulder and now hastened straight to his wife and children, and tossed them, as they wept, a couple of ducats, that his wife might get a good meal ready. His wife could not wonder enough whence her little husband had got so much money, but she did not venture to question him. After the meal the cobbler put the lamb on the table, called his children, that they might enjoy with him the rolling ducats, and shouted: ‘Lamb, shake yourself!’ But the lamb stood as if he were made of wood, and never even moved his head. The children, who had eaten their fill, began to laugh, and the wife thought that her husband was not quite right in his head. The cobbler, angry that his wish had not come to pass, repeated once more the old man’s words, but this time, too, without effect, therefore he pushed the lamb off the table. So long as the ducats held out, there was content in the home; but as soon as they began to run short in the cottage, his wife began to reproach her husband for doing no work, and not troubling himself about a livelihood.So nothing again remained for the cobbler but, stick in hand, to go to look for the old man. He knew very well what a bad welcome he would receive from him, but what was to be done? However, the old man had compassion on the poor family, and this time gave him a tablecloth, which at every summons: ‘Tablecloth, spread yourself!’ spread itself of its own accord, and on it stood most excellent food and drink; but under the condition that he didn’t go into his gossip’s house. The cobbler, well content with the present, thanked the old man and moved towards home. In a short time he was behind the hill, sat down upon the ground, and, not from curiosity but from hunger, gave the word of command to the tablecloth to spread itself; for his inside was croaking.When, after eating his fill, he went past the tavern, his old gossip was waiting for him in front of the door; she begged him in the kindest terms not to pass her tavern, adding the proverb: ‘Whoever passes a tavern sprains his foot.’ The cobbler wavered long, but at last went in and entrusted her with the table-cloth with these words: ‘Dear gossip, don’t say, “Table-cloth, spread yourself!”‘The crafty woman gave him brandy in welcome, not for money; therefore, her gossip tossed off noggin after noggin, till there came a dizziness in his head. Then his gossip did the same with the tablecloth as with the lamb. The cobbler came to his wife and children, placed the tablecloth on the table and cried: ‘Tablecloth, spread yourself!’ But the tablecloth didn’t stir, and the cobbler began to despair and to revile the old woman, his gossip. He returned again to the old man, begged pardon of him on his knees for not fulfilling the condition that time also, and prayed him, nevertheless, to have compassion on him and to be his preserver once more. The old man for a long time refused, but at last gave him a cudgel with a silver mounting set with precious stones, and ordered him this time to visit his gossip, and take note of these words: ‘Cudgel, bestir yourself!’ The cobbler, seized with new joy, thanked the old man a hundred times, and made the more haste towards his wife and children. Still, when behind the hill, he was curious to know what the cudgel meant, and wishing to satisfy himself, said: ‘Cudgel, bestir yourself!’In a moment there stood before him a couple of stout fellows, who began to thrash him mercilessly. The cobbler, seized by cruel terror, did not know how to order them to cease beating him; at last, when already well beaten, he cried out: ‘Cudgel, leave off!’ Instantly the fellows disappeared and the cudgel stood before him. ‘You’re good, you’re good!’ said the cobbler, getting up from the ground, ‘you’ll help me to those former gifts.’When he arrived at the village, where his gossip lived, he stepped into her house and made himself at home as with an old acquaintance. She was very glad to see him, for she thought she would again make a good profit, entertained him well, and afterwards began to inquire whether he hadn’t something for her to take charge of. Then the cobbler gave up to her his cudgel with the request not to say: ‘Cudgel, bestir yourself!’ The old woman laughed in her sleeve at the simpleton, thinking to herself, He wouldn’t tell me without cause what I’m not to say!’ She went at once with the cudgel into the other room, and scarcely had she crossed the threshold, when she cried out impatiently: ‘Cudgel, bestir yourself!’ Immediately the two fellows with cudgels began to beat her, and she lost all self-possession. At her piercing shrieks the host darted up to help her, when, hey ho! he got it too.The cobbler all the time kept calling out: ‘Go it, cudgel! go it! till they give me back my lamb and my tablecloth!’ Then nothing remained to his gossip but to give up his property to him. She ordered the lamb and tablecloth to be brought. As soon as the cobbler had satisfied himself that this was really done, he shouted ‘Cudgel, leave off!’ and went with the three gifts as quick as he could to his wife and children. Then there was great joy, for they had money and victuals in abundance; and did not withal forget God and other people, but assisted every poor person.","['cobbler', 'busying', 'saturday', 'mend',

839,slavic,Kovlad - 1. The Sovereign of the Mineral Kingdom,"Once upon a time, and a long long time ago it was, there lived a widow who had a very pretty daughter. The mother, good honest woman, was quite content with her station in life. But with the daughter it was otherwise; she, like a spoilt beauty, looked contemptuously upon her many admirers, her mind was full of proud and ambitious thoughts, and the more lovers she had, the prouder she became.One beautiful moonlight night the mother awoke, and being unable to sleep, began to pray God for the happiness of her only child, though she often made her mother’s life miserable. The fond woman looked lovingly at the beautiful daughter sleeping by her side, and she wondered, as she saw her smile, what happy dream had visited her. Then she finished her prayer, and laying her head on the girl’s pillow, fell asleep. Next day she said, “Come, darling child, tell me what you were dreaming about last night, you looked so happy smiling in your sleep.”“Oh yes, mother, I remember. I had a very beautiful dream. I thought a rich nobleman came to our house, in a splendid carriage of brass, and gave me a ring set with stones, that sparkled like the stars of heaven. When I entered the church with him, it was full of people, and they all thought me divine and adorable, like the Blessed Virgin.”“Ah! my child, what sin! May God keep you from such dreams.”But the daughter ran away singing, and busied herself about the house. The same day a handsome young farmer drove into the village in his cart and begged them to come and share his country bread. He was a kind fellow, and the mother liked him much. But the daughter refused his invitation, and insulted him into the bargain.“Even if you had driven in a carriage of brass,” she said, “and had offered me a ring set with stones shining as the stars in heaven, I would never have married you—you, a mere peasant!”The young farmer was terribly upset at her words, and with a prayer for her soul, returned home a saddened man. But her mother scolded and reproached her.The next night the woman again awoke, and taking her rosary prayed with still greater fervour, that God would bless her child. This time the girl laughed as she slept.“What can the poor child be dreaming about?” she said to herself: and sighing she prayed for her again. Then she laid her head upon her pillow and tried in vain to sleep. In the morning, when her daughter was dressing, she said: “Well, my dear, you were dreaming again last night, and laughing like a maniac.”“Was I? Listen, I dreamt a nobleman came for me in a silver carriage, and gave me a golden diadem. When I entered the church with him, the people admired and worshipped me more than the Blessed Virgin.”“Ay me, what a terrible dream! what a wicked dream! Pray God not to lead you into temptation.”Then she scolded her daughter severely and went out, slamming the door after her. That same day a carriage drove into the village, and some gentlemen invited mother and daughter to share the bread of the lord of the manor. The mother considered such an offer a great honour, but the daughter refused it and replied to the gentlemen scornfully: “Even if you had come to fetch me in a carriage of solid silver and had presented me with a golden diadem, I would never have consented to be the wife of your lord.”The gentlemen turned away in disgust and returned home; the mother rebuked her severely for so much pride.“Miserable, foolish girl!” she cried, “pride is a breath from hell. It is your duty to be humble, honest, and sweet-tempered.”The daughter replied by a laugh.The third night she slept soundly, but the poor woman at her side could not close her eyes. Tormented with dark forebodings, she feared some misfortune was about to happen, and counted her beads, praying fervently. All at once the young sleeper began to sneer and laugh.“Merciful God! ah me!” cried the poor woman, “what are these dreams that worry her poor brain!”In the morning she said, “What made you sneer so frightfully last night? You must have had bad dreams again, my poor child.”“Now, mother, you look as if you were going to preach again.”“No, no; but I want to know what you were dreaming about.”“Well, I dreamt some one drove up in a golden carriage and asked me to marry him, and he brought me a mantle of cloth of pure gold. When we came into church, the crowd pressed forward to kneel before me.”The mother wrung her hands piteously, and the girl left the room to avoid hearing her lamentations. That same day three carriages entered the yard, one of brass, one of silver, and one of gold. The first was drawn by two, the second by three, the third by four magnificent horses. Gentlemen wearing scarlet gloves and green mantles got out of the brass and silver carriages, while from the golden carriage alighted a prince who, as the sun shone on him, looked as if he were dressed in gold. They all made their way to the widow and asked for her daughter’s hand.“I fear we are not worthy of so much honour,” replied the widow meekly, but when the daughter’s eyes fell upon her suitor she recognised in him the lover of her dreams, and withdrew to weave an aigrette of many-coloured feathers. In exchange for this aigrette which she offered her bridegroom, he placed upon her finger a ring set with stones that shone like the stars in heaven, and over her shoulders a mantle of cloth of gold. The young bride, beside herself with joy, retired to complete her toilette. Meanwhile the anxious mother, a prey to the blackest forebodings, said to her son-in-law, “My daughter has consented to share your bread, tell me of what sort of flour it is made?”“In our house we have bread of brass, of silver, and of gold; my wife will be free to choose.”Such a reply astonished her more than ever, and made her still more unhappy. The daughter asked no questions, was in fact content to know nothing, not even what her mother suffered. She looked magnificent in her bridal attire and golden mantle, but she left her home with the prince without saying good-bye either to her mother or to her youthful companions. Neither did she ask her mother’s blessing, though the latter wept and prayed for her safety.After the marriage ceremony they mounted the golden carriage and set off, followed by the attendants of silver and brass. The procession moved slowly along the road without stopping until it reached the foot of a high rock. Here, instead of a carriage entrance, was a large cavern which led out into a steep slope down which the horses went lower and lower. The giant Zémo-tras (he who makes the earthquakes) closed the opening with a huge stone. They made their way in darkness for some time, the terrified bride being reassured by her husband.“Fear nothing,” said he, “in a little while it will be clear and beautiful.”Grotesque dwarfs, carrying lighted torches, appeared on all sides, saluted and welcomed their King Kovlad as they illumined the road for him and his attendants. Then for the first time the girl knew she had married Kovlad, but this mattered little to her. On coming out from these gloomy passages into the open they found themselves surrounded by large forests and mountains, mountains that seemed to touch the sky. And, strange to relate, all the trees of whatsoever kind, and even the mountains that seemed to touch the sky, were of solid lead. When they had crossed these marvellous mountains the giant Zémo-tras closed all the openings in the road they had passed. They then drove out upon vast and beautiful plains, in the centre of which was a golden palace covered with precious stones. The bride was weary with looking at so many wonders, and gladly sat down to the feast prepared by the dwarfs. Meats of many kinds were served, roast and boiled, but lo! they were of metal—brass, silver, and gold. Every one ate heartily and enjoyed the food, but the young wife, with tears in her eyes, begged for a piece of bread.“Certainly, madam, with pleasure,” answered Kovlad. But she could not eat the bread which was brought, for it was of brass. Then the king sent for a piece of silver bread, still she could not eat it; and again for a slice of golden bread, that too she was unable to bite. The servants did all they could to get something to their mistress’s taste, but she found it impossible to eat anything.“I should be most happy to gratify you,” said Kovlad “but we have no other kind of food.”Then she realised for the first time in whose power she had placed herself, and she began to weep bitterly and wish she had taken her mother’s advice.“It is of no use to weep and regret,” said Kovlad, “you must have known the kind of bread you would have to break here; your wish has been fulfilled.”And so it was, for nothing can recall the past. The wretched girl was obliged henceforth to live underground with her husband Kovlad, the God of Metals, in his golden palace. And this because she had set her heart upon nothing but the possession of gold, and had never wished for anything better.","['upon', 'time', 'long', 'long', 'time', 'live', 'widow', 'pretty',

850,slavic,The Silver Tracks - The Story of the Poor Man Who Befriended a Beggar,"There were once three brothers who lived in the same village. One of them was very rich. He had houses and fields and barns. He had nothing to spend his money on for he had no children and his wife was as saving and hardworking as himself. The second brother was not so rich but he, too, was prosperous. He had one son and all his thought was to accumulate money and property in order to leave his son rich. He schemed and worked and slaved and made his wife do the same.The third brother was industrious but very poor. He worked early and late and never took a holiday. He couldn’t afford to for he had a wife and ten children and only by working every hour of the day and often far into the night could he earn enough to buy food for so large a family. He was a simple man and a good man and he taught his children that the most important thing for them to do in life was to love God and be kind to their fellowmen.Now it happened that once, when our Lord Christ was on earth testing out the hearts of men, he came in the guise of a beggar to the village where the three brothers lived. He came in a brokendown cart driving a wheezy old horse. It was cold and raining and night was falling.The Beggar knocked at the door of the richest brother and said:“I pray you in God’s name give shelter for the night to me and my horse.”“What!” cried the rich man, “do you suppose I have nothing better to do than give shelter to such as you! Be off with you or I’ll call my men and have them give you the beating you deserve!”The Beggar left without another word and went to the house of the next brother. He was civil at least to the Beggar and pretended that he was sorry to refuse him.“I’d accommodate you if I could,” he said, “but the truth is I can’t. My house isn’t as big as it looks and I have many people dependent on me. Just go on a little farther and I’m sure you’ll find some one who will take you in.”The Beggar turned his horse’s head and went to the tiny little house where the poor brother lived with his big family. He knocked on the door and begged for shelter.“Come in, brother,” said the Poor Man. “We’re pretty crowded here but we’ll find a place for you.”“And my horse,” the Beggar said; “I’m afraid to leave him out in the rain and cold.”“We’ll stable him with my donkey,” the Poor Man said. “Do you come in here by the fire and dry off and I’ll see to the horse.”The Poor Man pulled out his own cart until it was exposed to the rain in order to make a dry place in the shed for the Beggar’s cart. Then he led the Beggar’s gaunt horse into his tiny stable and fed him for the night out of his own slender store of oats and hay.He and his family shared their evening meal with the Beggar and then made up for him a bed of straw near the fire where he was able to pass the night comfortably and warmly.The next morning as he was leaving he said to the Poor Man:“You must come sometime to my house and visit me and let me return the hospitality you have shown me.”“Where do you live?” the Poor Man asked.“You can always find me,” the Beggar said, “by following the tracks of my cart. You will know them because they are broader than the tracks of any other cart. You will come, won’t you?”“Yes,” the Poor Man promised, “I will if ever I have time.”They bade each other good-by and the Beggar drove slowly off. Then the Poor Man went to the shed to get his own cart and the first thing he saw were two large silver bolts lying on the ground.“They must have fallen from the Beggar’s cart!” he thought to himself and he ran out to the road to see whether the Beggar were still in sight. But he and the cart had disappeared.“I hope he has no accident on account of those bolts!” the Poor Man said.When he went to the stable to get his donkey he found four golden horse-shoes where the Beggar’s horse had been standing.“Four golden horse-shoes!” he exclaimed. “I ought to return them and the silver bolts at once! But I can’t to-day, I’m too busy. Well, I’ll hide them safely away and some afternoon when I have a few hours to spare I’ll follow the tracks of the cart to the Beggar’s house.”That afternoon he met his two rich brothers and told them about the Beggar.“Silver bolts!” cried one.“Golden horse-shoes!” cried the other. “Take us home with you and let us see them!”So they went home with the Poor Man and saw for themselves the silver bolts and the golden horse-shoes.“Brothers,” the Poor Man said, “if either of you have time I wish you’d take these things and return them to the Beggar.”They both said, no, no, they hadn’t time, but they would like to know where the Beggar lived.“He said I could always find him,” the Poor Man said, “by following the tracks of his cart.”“The tracks of his cart!” echoed the other two. “Show us the tracks of his cart!”They went to the shed where the cart had been and followed the tracks out to the road. Even on the road they were easy to see for besides being wider than any other cart tracks they shone white like glistening silver.“H’m! H’m!” murmured the two rich brothers.“You don’t think either of you have time to follow them to the Beggar’s house?” the Poor Man said.“No! Of course not! Of course not!” they both answered.But in his heart each had already decided to go at once and see for himself what kind of a Beggar this was who had silver bolts in his cart and golden shoes on his horse.The oldest brother went the very next day driving a new wagon and a fine horse. The silver tracks led through woods and fields and over hills. They came at last to a river which was spanned by a wooden bridge. It was cunningly constructed of timbers beautifully hewn. The rich man had never seen such wood used on a bridge.By the roadside beyond the bridge there was a pigsty with one trough full of corn and another full of water. There were two sows in the sty and they were fighting each other and tearing at each other and paying no attention whatever to all the good food in the trough.A little farther on there was another river and over it another wonderful bridge, this one made entirely of stone.Beyond it the rich man came to a meadow where there was a hayrick around which two angry bulls were chasing each other and goring each other until the blood spurted.“I wonder some one doesn’t stop them!” the rich man thought to himself.The next river had an iron bridge, more beautiful than the rich man had ever supposed an iron bridge could be.Beyond the iron bridge there was a field and a bush and two angry rams that were chasing each other around the bush and fighting. Their horns cracked as they met and their hides were torn and bleeding where they had gored each other.“I never saw so many angry fighting animals!” the rich man thought to himself.The next bridge glowed in the sun like the embers of a fire for it was built entirely of shining copper—copper rivets, copper plates, copper beams, nothing but copper.The silver tracks led over the copper bridge into a broad valley. By the roadside there was a high crossbar from which depended heavy cuts of meat—lamb and pork and veal. Two large bitch dogs were jumping at the meat and then snarling and snapping at each other.The next bridge was the loveliest of them all for it was built of white gleaming silver.The rich man climbed down from his wagon and examined it closely.“It would be worth a man’s while to carry home a piece of this bridge!” he muttered to himself.He tried the rivets, he shook the railing. At last he found four loose bolts which he was able to pull out. The four together were so heavy that he was scarcely able to lift them. He looked cautiously about and when he saw that no one was looking, he slipped them one by one into the bottom of his wagon and covered them with straw. Then he turned his horse’s head and drove home as fast as he could. It was midnight when he got there and nobody about to spy on him as he hid the silver bolts in the hay.The next day when he went out alone to gloat over his treasure he found instead of four heavy silver bolts four pieces of wood!So that’s what the rich brother got for following the silver tracks.A day or two later without saying a word to any one, the second brother decided that he would follow the silver tracks and have a look at the strange Beggar whose cart had silver bolts and whose wheezy horse had golden shoes.“Perhaps if I keep my wits about me I’ll be able to pick up a few golden horse-shoes. Not many boys inherit golden horse-shoes from their fathers!”Well, the second brother went over exactly the same route and saw exactly the same things. He crossed all those wonderful bridges that his brother had crossed—the wooden bridge, the stone bridge, the iron bridge, the copper bridge, the silver bridge, and he saw all those angry animals still trying to gore each other to death.He didn’t stop at the silver bridge for he thought to himself:“Perhaps the next bridge will be golden and if it is I may be able to break off a piece of it!”Beyond the silver bridge was another broad valley and the second brother saw many strange sights as he drove through. There was a man standing alone in a field and trying to beat off a flock of ravens that were swooping down and pecking at his eyes. Near him was an old man with snow-white hair who was making loud outcries to heaven praying to be delivered from the two oxen who were munching at his white hair as though it were so much hay. They ate great wisps of it and the more they ate the more grew out.There was an apple-tree heavily laden with ripe fruit and a hungry man forever reaching up and plucking an apple. The apples were apples of Sodom and always as the hungry man raised each new one to his mouth it turned to ashes.In another place a thirsty man was reaching with a dipper into a well and always, just as he was about to scoop up some water, the well moved away from under the dipper.“What a strange country this is!” thought the second brother as he drove on.At last he reached the next bridge and sure enough it was shining gold! Every part of it—bolts and beams and pillars, all were gold. In great excitement the second brother climbed down from his wagon and began pulling and wrenching at various parts of the bridge hoping to find some loose pieces which he could break off. At last he succeeded in pulling out four long bolts which were so heavy he could scarcely lift them. After looking about in all directions to make sure that no one saw him, he put them into his wagon and covered them up with straw. Then he drove homewards as fast as he could.“Ha! Ha!” he chuckled as he hid the golden bolts in the barn. “My son will now be a richer man than my brother!”He could scarcely sleep with thinking of his golden treasure and at the first light of morning he slipped out to the barn. Imagine his rage when he found in the straw four bolts of wood!So that was all the second brother got for following the silver tracks.Well, years went by and the Poor Man worked day after day and all day and often far into the night. Some of his children died and the rest grew up and went out into the world and married and made homes of their own. Then at last his good wife died and the time came when the Poor Man was old and all alone in the world.One night as he sat on his doorstep thinking of his wife and of his children when they were little and of all the years he had worked for them to keep them fed and clothed, he happened to remember the Beggar and the promise he had made to visit him sometime.“And to think of all the years I’ve kept his golden horse-shoes and his silver bolts! Well, he’ll forgive me, I know,” thought the Poor Man, “for he’ll understand that I’ve always been too busy up to this time ever to follow the tracks of his cart. I wonder are they still there.”He went out to the roadside and peered down and how it happened I don’t know, but to his dim eyes at least there were the silver tracks as clear as ever.“Good!” cried the Poor Man. “To-morrow morning bright and early I’ll hitch up the donkey and visit my old friend, the Beggar!”So the next day he took out the silver bolts and the golden horse-shoes from the place where he had kept them hidden all these years and he put them in a bag. Then he hitched his old donkey to his old cart and started out to follow the silver tracks to the Beggar’s home.Well, he saw just exactly the same things that his brothers had seen those many years before: all those terrible fighting animals and all those unfortunate men.“I’ll have to remember and ask the Beggar what ails all these creatures,” he thought to himself.Like his brothers he passed over the wooden bridge and the stone bridge and the iron bridge and the copper bridge and the silver bridge and even the golden bridge. Beyond the golden bridge he came to a Garden that was surrounded by a high wall of diamonds and rubies and sapphires and all kinds of precious stones that blazed as brightly as the sun itself. The silver tracks turned in at the garden gate which was locked.The poor man climbed down from his cart, unhitched the donkey, and set him out to graze on the tender grass that grew by the wayside.Then he took the bag that held the golden horse-shoes and the silver bolts and he went to the garden gate. It was a very wonderful gate of beaten gold set with precious stones. For a moment the Poor Man wondered if he dare knock at so rich a gate, then he remembered that his friend the Beggar was inside and he knew that he would be made welcome.It was the Beggar himself who opened the gate. When he saw the Poor Man he smiled and held out his hands and said:“Welcome, dear friend! I have been waiting for you all these years! Come in and I will show you my Garden.”So the Poor Man went inside. And first of all he gave the Beggar his golden horse-shoes and his silver bolts.“Forgive me,” he said, “for keeping them so long, but I’ve never had time until now to return them.”The Beggar smiled.“I knew, dear friend, that they were safe with you and that you would bring them some day.”Then the Beggar put his arm over the Poor Man’s shoulder and led him through the Garden showing him the wonderful golden fruits and beautiful flowers. They sat them down beside a fountain of crystal water and while they listened to the songs of glorious birds they talked together and the Poor Man asked about the strange things he had seen along the road.“All those animals,” the Beggar said, “were once human beings who instead of fearing God and being kind to their fellowmen passed all their time fighting and cheating and cursing. The two sows were two sisters-in-law who hated each other bitterly. The two bulls and the two rams were neighbors who fought for years and years over the boundary lines of their farms and now they keep on fighting through eternity. The two bitches were two sisters who fought until they died over the inheritance left them by their father. The old man whose hair the oxen eat was a farmer who always pastured his cattle on his neighbors’ fields. Now he has his reward. The man at whose eyes the ravens peck was an ungrateful son who mistreated his parents. The man with the awful thirst that can never be quenched was a drunkard, and the one at whose lips the apples turn to ashes was a glutton.”So they talked on together, the Poor Man and the Beggar, until it was late afternoon and the Beggar said:“And now, dear friend, you will sup with me as I once supped with you.”“Thank you,” the Poor Man said, “I will. But let me first go out and see how my donkey is.”“Very well,” the Beggar said, “go. But be sure to come back for I shall be waiting for you.”So the Poor Man went out the garden gate and looked for his donkey. But the donkey was gone.“He must have started home,” the Poor Man thought. “I’ll hurry and overtake him.”So he started back afoot the way he had come. He went on and on but saw no donkey. He crossed the golden bridge and the silver bridge and the copper bridge and the iron bridge and the stone bridge and last of all the wooden bridge, but still there was no donkey.“He must have got all the way home,” he thought.When the Poor Man reached his native village things looked different. Houses that he remembered had disappeared and others had taken their places. He couldn’t find his own little house at all. He asked the people he met and they knew nothing about it. And they knew nothing about him, either, not even his name. And nobody even knew about his sons. At last he did meet one old man who remembered the family name and who told him that many years before the last of the sons had gone to another village to live.“There’s no place here for me,” the Poor Man thought. “I better go back to my friend the Beggar and stay with him. No one else wants me.”So once again he followed the silver tracks all that long way over all those bridges and when at last he reached the garden gate he was very tired, for he was old and feeble now. It was all he could do to give one faint little knock. But the Beggar heard him and came running to let him in. And when he saw him, how tired he was and how feeble, he put his arm around him and helped him into the Garden and he said:“You shall stay with me now forever and we shall be very happy together.”And the Poor Man when he looked in the Beggar’s face to thank him saw that he was not a beggar at all but the Blessed Christ Himself. And then he knew that he was in the Garden of Paradise.","['three', 'brother', 'live', 'village', 'rich', 'house', 'field', 'barn', 'nothing', 'spend', 'money', 'child', 'wife', 'save', 'hardworking',

991,slavic,The Dragon's Strength - The Story of the Youngest Prince Who Killed the Sparrow,"There was once a King who had three sons. One day the oldest son went hunting and when night fell his huntsmen came riding home without him.“Where is the prince?” the King asked.“Isn’t he here?” the huntsmen said. “He left us in midafternoon chasing a hare near the Old Mill up the river. We haven’t seen him since and we supposed he must have come home alone.”When he hadn’t returned the following day his brother, the second prince, went out to search for him.“I’ll go to the Old Mill,” he said to the King, “and see what’s become of him.”So he mounted his horse and rode up the river. As he neared the Old Mill a hare crossed his path and the second prince being a hunter like his brother at once gave chase. His attendant waited for his return but waited in vain. Night fell and still there was no sign of the second prince.The attendant returned to the palace and told the King what had happened. The King was surprised but not unduly alarmed and the following day when the Youngest Prince asked to go hunting alone the King suggested that he go in the direction of the Old Mill to find out if he could what was keeping his brothers.The Youngest Prince who had listened carefully to what his brothers’ attendants had reported decided to act cautiously. So when a hare crossed his path as he approached the Old Mill, instead of giving it chase, he rode off as though he were hunting other game. Later he returned to the Old Mill from another direction.He found an old woman sitting in front of it.“Good evening, granny,” he said in a friendly tone, pulling up his horse for a moment’s chat. “Do you live here? You know I thought the Old Mill was deserted.”The old woman looked at him and shook her head gloomily.“Deserted indeed! My boy, take an old woman’s advice and don’t have anything to do with this old mill! It’s an evil place!”“Why, granny,” the Prince said, “what’s the matter with it?”The old woman peered cautiously around and when she saw they were alone she beckoned the Prince to come near. Then she whispered:“A dragon lives here! A horrible monster! He takes the form of a hare and lures people into the mill. Then he captures them. Some of them he kills and eats and others he holds as prisoners in an underground dungeon. I’m one of his prisoners and he keeps me here to work for him.”“Granny,” the Youngest Prince said, “would you like me to rescue you?”“My boy, you couldn’t do it! You have no idea what a strong evil monster the dragon is.”“If you found out something for me, granny, I think I might be able to overcome the dragon and rescue you.”The old woman was doubtful but she promised to do anything the Youngest Prince asked.“Well then, granny, find out from the dragon where his strength is, whether in his own body or somewhere else. Find out to-night and I’ll come back to-morrow at this same hour to see you.”So that night when the dragon came home, after he had supped and when she was scratching his head to make him drowsy for bed, the old woman said to him:“Master, I think you’re the strongest dragon in the world! Tell me now, where does your strength lie—in your own beautiful body or somewhere else?”“You’re right, old woman,” the dragon grunted: “I am pretty strong as dragons go. But I don’t keep my strength in my own body. No, indeed! That would be too dangerous. I keep it in the hearth yonder.”At that the old woman ran over to the hearth and, stooping down, she kissed it and caressed it.“O beautiful hearth!” she said, “where my master’s strength is hidden! How happy are the ashes that cover your stones!”The dragon laughed with amusement.“That’s the time I fooled you, old woman! My strength isn’t in the hearth at all! It’s in the tree in front of the mill.”The old woman at once ran out of the mill and threw her arms about the tree.“O tree!” she cried, “most beautiful tree in the world, guard carefully our master’s strength and let no harm come to it!”Again the dragon laughed.“I’ve fooled you another time, old woman! Come here and scratch my head some more and this time I’ll tell you the truth for I see you really love your master.”So the old woman went back and scratched the dragon’s head and the dragon told her the truth about his strength.“I keep it far away,” he said. “In the third kingdom from here near the Tsar’s own city there is a deep lake. A dragon lives at the bottom of the lake. In the dragon there is a wild boar; in the boar a hare; in the hare a pigeon; in the pigeon a sparrow. My strength is in the sparrow. Let any one kill the sparrow and I should die that instant. But I am safe. No one but shepherds ever come to the lake and even they don’t come any more for the dragon has eaten up so many of them that the lake has got a bad name. Indeed, nowadays even the Tsar himself is hard put to it to find a shepherd. Oh, I tell you, old woman, your master is a clever one!”So now the old woman had the dragon’s secret and the next day she told it to the Youngest Prince. He at once devised a plan whereby he hoped to overcome the dragon. He dressed himself as a shepherd and with crook in hand started off on foot for the third kingdom. He traveled through villages and towns, across rivers and over mountains, and reached at last the third kingdom and the Tsar’s own city. He presented himself at the palace and asked employment as a shepherd.The guards looked at him in surprise and said:“A shepherd! Are you sure you want to be a shepherd?”Then they called to their companions: “Here’s a youth who wants to be a shepherd!” And the word went through the palace and even the Tsar heard it.“Send the youth to me,” he ordered.“Do you really want to be my shepherd?” he asked the Youngest Prince.The Youngest Prince said yes, he did.“If I put you in charge of the sheep, where would you pasture them?”“Isn’t there a lake beyond the city,” the Prince asked, “where the grazing is good?”“H’m!” said the Tsar. “So you know about that lake, too! What else do you know?”“I’ve heard the shepherds disappear.”“And still you want to try your luck?” the Tsar exclaimed.Just then the Tsar’s only daughter, a lovely Princess, who had been looking at the young stranger, slipped over to her father and whispered:“But, father, you can’t let such a handsome young man as that go off with the sheep! It would be dreadful if he never returned!”The Tsar whispered back:“Hush, child! Your concern for the young man’s safety does credit to your noble feelings. But this is not the time or the place for sentiment. We must consider first the welfare of the royal sheep.”He turned to the Youngest Prince:“Very well, young man, you may consider yourself engaged as shepherd. Provide yourself with whatever you need and assume your duties at once.”“There is one thing,” the Youngest Prince said; “when I start out to-morrow morning with the sheep I should like to take with me two strong boarhounds, a falcon, and a set of bagpipes.”“You shall have them all,” the Tsar promised.Early the next morning when the Princess peeped out of her bedroom window she saw the new shepherd driving the royal flocks to pasture. A falcon was perched on his shoulder; he had a set of bagpipes under his arm; and he was leading two powerful boarhounds on a leash.“It’s a shame!” the Princess said to herself. “He’ll probably never return and he’s such a handsome young man, too!” And she was so unhappy at thought of never again seeing the new shepherd that she couldn’t go back to sleep.Well, the Youngest Prince reached the lake and turned out his sheep to graze. He perched the falcon on a log, tied the dogs beside it, and laid his bagpipes on the ground. Then he took off his smock, rolled up his hose, and wading boldly into the lake called out in a loud voice:“Ho, dragon, come out and we’ll try a wrestling match! That is, if you’re not afraid!”“Afraid?” bellowed an awful voice. “Who’s afraid?”The water of the lake churned this way and that and a horrible scaly monster came to the surface. He crawled out on shore and clutched the Prince around the waist. And the Prince clutched him in a grip just as strong and there they swayed back and forth, and rolled over, and wrestled together on the shore of the lake without either getting the better of the other. By midafternoon when the sun was hot, the dragon grew faint and cried out:“Oh, if I could but dip my burning head in the cool water, then I could toss you as high as the sky!”“Don’t talk nonsense!” the Prince said. “If the Tsar’s daughter would kiss my forehead, then I could toss you twice as high!”After that the dragon slipped out of the Prince’s grasp, plunged into the water, and disappeared. The Prince waited for him but he didn’t show his scaly head again that day.When evening came, the Prince washed off the grime of the fight, dressed himself carefully, and then looking as fresh and handsome as ever drove home his sheep. With the falcon on his shoulder and the two hounds at his heels he came playing a merry tune on his bagpipes.The townspeople hearing the bagpipes ran out of their houses and cried to each other:“The shepherd’s come back!”The Princess ran to her window and, when she saw the shepherd alive and well, she put her hand to her heart and said:Even the Tsar was pleased.“I’m not a bit surprised that he’s back!” he said. “There’s something about this youth that I like!”The next day the Tsar sent two of his trusted servants to the lake to see what was happening there. They hid themselves behind some bushes on a little hill that commanded the lake. They were there when the shepherd arrived and they watched him as he waded out into the water and challenged the dragon as on the day before.They heard the shepherd call out in a loud voice:“Ho, dragon, come out and we’ll try a wrestling match! That is, if you’re not afraid!”And from the water they heard an awful voice bellow back:“Afraid? Who’s afraid?”Then they saw the water of the lake churn this way and that and a horrible scaly monster come to the surface. They saw him crawl out on shore and clutch the shepherd around the waist. And they saw the shepherd clutch him in a grip just as strong. And they watched the two as they swayed back and forth and rolled over and wrestled together without either getting the better of the other. By midafternoon when the sun grew hot they saw the dragon grow faint and they heard him cry out:“Oh, if I could only dip my burning head in the cool water, then I could toss you as high as the sky!”And they heard the shepherd reply:“Don’t talk nonsense! If the Tsar’s daughter would kiss my forehead, then I could toss you twice as high!”Then they saw the dragon slip out of the shepherd’s grasp, plunge into the water, and disappear. They waited but he didn’t show his scaly head again that day.So the Tsar’s servants hurried home before the shepherd and told the Tsar all they had seen and heard. The Tsar was mightily impressed with the bravery of the shepherd and he declared that if he killed that horrid dragon he should have the Princess herself for wife!He sent for his daughter and told her all that his servants had reported and he said to her:“My daughter, you, too, can help rid your country of this monster if you go out with the shepherd to-morrow and when the time comes kiss him on the forehead. You will do this, will you not, for your country’s sake?”The Princess blushed and trembled and the Tsar, looking at her in surprise, said:“What! Shall a humble shepherd face a dragon unafraid and the daughter of the Tsar tremble!”“Father,” the Princess cried, “it isn’t the dragon that I’m afraid of!”“What then?” the Tsar asked.But what it was she was afraid of the Princess would not confess. Instead she said:“If the welfare of my country require that I kiss the shepherd on the forehead, I shall do so.”So the next morning when the shepherd started out with his sheep, the falcon on his shoulder, the dogs at his heels, the bagpipes under his arm, the Princess walked beside him.Her eyes were downcast and he saw that she was trembling.“Do not be afraid, dear Princess,” he said to her. “Nothing shall harm you—I promise that!”“I’m not afraid,” the Princess murmured. But she continued to blush and tremble and, although the shepherd tried to look into her eyes to reassure her, she kept her head averted.This time the Tsar himself and many of his courtiers had gone on before and taken their stand on the hill that overlooked the lake to see the final combat of the shepherd and the dragon.When the shepherd and the Princess reached the lake, the shepherd put his falcon on the log as before and tied the dogs beside it and laid his bagpipes on the ground. Then he threw off his smock, rolled up his hose, and wading boldly into the lake called out in a loud voice:“Ho, dragon, come out and we’ll try a wrestling match! That is, if you’re not afraid!”“Afraid?” bellowed an awful voice. “Who’s afraid?”The water of the lake churned this way and that and the horrible scaly monster came to the surface. He crawled to shore and clutched the shepherd around the waist. The shepherd clutched him in a grip just as strong and there they swayed back and forth and rolled over and wrestled together on the shore of the lake without either getting the better of the other. The Princess without the least show of fear stood nearby calling out encouragement to the shepherd and waiting for the moment when the shepherd should need her help.By midafternoon when the sun was hot, the dragon grew faint and cried out:“Oh, if I could but dip my burning head in the cool water, then I could toss you as high as the sky!”“Don’t talk nonsense!” the shepherd said. “If the Tsar’s daughter would kiss my forehead then I could toss you twice as high!”Instantly the Princess ran forward and kissed the shepherd three times. The first kiss fell on his forehead, the second on his nose, the third on his mouth. With each kiss his strength increased an hundredfold and taking the dragon in a mighty grip he tossed him up so high that for a moment the Tsar and all the courtiers lost sight of him in the sky. Then he fell to earth with such a thud that he burst.Out of his body sprang a wild boar. The shepherd was ready for this and on the moment he unleashed the two hounds and they fell on the boar and tore him to pieces.Out of the boar jumped a rabbit. It went leaping across the meadow but the dogs caught it and killed it.Out of the rabbit flew a pigeon. Instantly the shepherd unloosed the falcon. It rose high in the air, then swooped down upon the pigeon, clutched it in its talons, and delivered it into the shepherd’s hands.He cut open the pigeon and found the sparrow.“Spare me! Spare me!” squawked the sparrow.“Tell me where my brothers are,” the shepherd demanded with his fingers about the sparrow’s throat.“Your brothers? They are alive and in the deep dungeon that lies below the Old Mill. Behind the mill there are three willow saplings growing from one old root. Cut the saplings and strike the root. A heavy iron door leading down into the dungeon will open. In the dungeon you will find many captives old and young, your brothers among them. Now that I have told you this are you going to spare my life?”But the shepherd wrung the sparrow’s neck for he knew that only in that way could the monster who had captured his brothers be killed.Well, now that the dragon was dead the Tsar and all his courtiers came down from the hill and embraced the shepherd and told him what a brave youth he was.“You have delivered us all from a horrid monster,” the Tsar said, “and to show you my gratitude and the country’s gratitude I offer you my daughter for wife.”“Thank you,” said the shepherd, “but I couldn’t think of marrying the Princess unless she is willing to marry me.”The Princess blushed and trembled just as she had blushed and trembled the night before and that morning, too, on the way to the lake. She tried to speak but could not at first. Then in a very little voice she said:“As a Princess I think it is my duty to marry this brave shepherd who has delivered my country from this terrible dragon, and—and I think I should want to marry him anyway.”She said the last part of her speech in such a very low voice that only the shepherd himself heard it. But that was right enough because after all it was intended only for him.So then and there beside the lake before even the shepherd had time to wash his face and hands and put on his smock the Tsar put the Princess’s hand in his hand and pronounced them betrothed.After that the shepherd bathed in the lake and then refreshed and clean he sounded his bagpipes and he and the Princess and the Tsar and all the courtiers returned to the city driving the sheep before them.All the townspeople came out to meet them and they danced to the music of the bagpipes and there was great rejoicing both over the death of the dragon and over the betrothal of the Princess and the brave shepherd.The wedding took place at once and the wedding festivities lasted a week. Such feasting as the townspeople had! Such music and dancing!When the wedding festivities were ended, the shepherd told the Tsar who he really was.“You say you’re a Prince!” the Tsar cried, perfectly delighted at this news. Then he declared he wasn’t in the least surprised. In fact, he said, he had suspected as much from the first!“Do you think it likely,” he asked somewhat pompously, “that any daughter of mine would fall in love with a man who wasn’t a prince?”“I think I’d have fallen in love with you whatever you were!” whispered the Princess to her young husband. But she didn’t let her father hear her!The Prince told the Tsar about his brothers’ captivity and how he must go home to release them, and the Tsar at once said that he and his bride might go provided they returned as soon as possible.They agreed to this and the Tsar fitted out a splendid escort for them and sent them away with his blessing.So the Prince now traveled back through the towns and villages of three kingdoms, across rivers and over mountains, no longer a humble shepherd on foot, but a rich and mighty personage riding in a manner that befitted his rank.When he reached the deserted mill, his friend the old woman was waiting for him.“I know, my Prince, you have succeeded for the monster has disappeared.”“Yes, granny, you are right: I have succeeded. I found the dragon in the lake, and the boar in the dragon, and the rabbit in the boar, and the pigeon in the rabbit, and the sparrow in the pigeon. I took the sparrow and killed it. So you are free now, granny, to return to your home. And soon all those other poor captives will be free.”He went behind the mill and found the three willow saplings. He cut them off and struck the old root. Sure enough a heavy iron door opened. This led down into a deep dungeon which was crowded with unfortunate prisoners. The Prince led them all out and sent them their various ways. He found his own two brothers among them and led them home to his father.There was great rejoicing in the King’s house, and in the King’s heart, too, for he had given up hope of ever seeing any of his sons again.The King was so charmed with the Princess that he said it was a pity that she couldn’t marry his oldest son so that she might one day be Queen.“The Youngest Prince is a capable young man,” the King said, “and there’s no denying that he managed this business of killing the dragon very neatly. But he is after all only the Youngest Prince with very little hope of succeeding to the kingdom. If you hadn’t married him in such haste one of his older brothers might easily have fallen in love with you.”“I don’t regret my haste,” the Princess said. “Besides he is now my father’s heir. But that doesn’t matter for I should be happy with the Youngest Prince if he were only a shepherd.”","['king', 'three', 'hunt', 'night', 'fell', 'huntsman', 'come', 'home', 'without', 'prince',

1013,slavic,The Prince with the Golden Hand,"There once lived a king and queen who had an only daughter. And the beauty of this princess surpassed everything seen or heard of. Her forehead was brilliant as the moon, her lips like the rose, her complexion had the delicacy of the lily, and her breath the sweetness of jessamine. Her hair was golden, and in her voice and glance there was something so enchanting that none could help listening to her or looking at her.The princess lived for seventeen years in her own rooms, rejoicing the heart of her parents, teachers, and servants. No one else ever saw her, for the sons of the king and all other princes were forbidden to enter her rooms. She never went anywhere, never looked upon the outside world, and never breathed the outer air, but she was perfectly happy.When she was eighteen it happened, either by chance or by the will of fate, that she heard the cry of the cuckoo. This sound made her strangely uneasy; her golden head drooped, and covering her eyes with her hands, she fell into thought so deep as not to hear her mother enter. The queen looked at her anxiously, and after comforting her went to tell the king about it.For many years past the sons of kings and neighbouring princes had, either personally or by their ambassadors, presented themselves at court to ask the king for the hand of his daughter in marriage. But he had always bidden them wait until another time. Now, after a long consultation with the queen, he sent messengers to foreign courts and elsewhere to proclaim that the princess, in accordance with the wishes of her parents, was about to choose a husband, and that the man of her choice would also have the right of succession to the throne.When the princess heard of this decision her joy was very great, and for days she would dream about it. Then she looked out into the garden through the golden lattice of her window, and longed with an irresistible longing to walk in the open air upon the smooth lawn. With great difficulty she at last persuaded her governesses to allow her to do so, they agreeing on condition that she should keep with them. So the crystal doors were thrown open, the oaken gates that shut in the orchard turned on their hinges, and the princess found herself on the green grass. She ran about, picking the sweet-scented flowers and chasing the many-coloured butterflies. But she could not have been a very prudent maiden, for she wandered away from her governesses, with her face uncovered.Just at that moment a raging hurricane, such as had never been seen or heard before, passed by and fell upon the garden. It roared and whistled round and round, then seizing the princess carried her far away. The terrified governesses wrung their hands, and were for a time speechless with grief. At last they rushed into the palace, and throwing themselves on their knees before the king and queen, told them with sobs and tears what had happened. They were overwhelmed with sorrow and knew not what to do.By this time quite a crowd of princes had arrived at the palace, and seeing the king in such bitter grief, inquired the reason of it.“Sorrow has touched my white hairs,” said the king. “The hurricane has carried off my dearly beloved child, the sweet Princess with the Golden Hair, and I know not where it has taken her. Whoever finds this out, and brings her back to me, shall have her for his wife, and with her half my kingdom for a wedding present, and the remainder of my wealth and titles after my death.”After hearing these words, princes and knights mounted their horses and set off to search throughout the world for the beautiful Princess with the Golden Hair, who had been carried away by Vikher.Now among the seekers were two brothers, sons of a king, and they travelled together through many countries asking for news of the princess, but no one knew anything about her. But they continued their search, and at the end of two years arrived in a country that lies in the centre of the earth, and has summer and winter at the same time.The princes determined to find out whether this was the place where the hurricane had hidden the Princess with the Golden Hair. So they began to ascend one of the mountains on foot, leaving their horses behind them to feed on the grass. On reaching the top, they came in sight of a silver palace supported on a cock’s foot, while at one of the windows the sun’s rays shone upon a head of golden hair; surely it could only belong to the princess. Suddenly the north wind blew so violently, and the cold became so intense, that the leaves of the trees withered and the breath froze. The two princes tried to keep their footing, and battled manfully against the storm, but they were overcome by its fierceness and fell together, frozen to death.Their broken-hearted parents waited for them in vain. Masses were said, charities distributed, and prayers sent up to God to pity them in their sorrow.One day when the queen, the mother of the princes, was giving a poor old man some money she said to him, “My good old friend, pray God to guard our sons and soon bring them back in good health.”“Ah, noble lady,” answered he, “that prayer would be useless. Everlasting rest is all one may ask for the dead, but in return for the love you have shown and the money you have given the poor and needy, I am charged with this message—that God has taken pity on your sorrow, and that ere long you will be the mother of a son, the like of whom has never yet been seen.”The old man, having spoken thus, vanished.The queen, whose tears were falling, felt a strange joy enter her heart and a feeling of happiness steal over her, as she went to the king and repeated the old man’s words. And so it came to pass, for a week or two later God sent her a son, and he was in no way like an ordinary child. His eyes resembled those of a falcon, and his eyebrows the sable’s fur. His right hand was of pure gold, and his manner and appearance were so full of an indescribable majesty, that he was looked upon by every one with a feeling of awe.His growth, too, was not like that of other children. When but three days old, he stepped out of his swaddling-clothes and left his cradle. And he was so strong that when his parents entered the room he ran towards them, crying out, “Good morning, dear parents, why are you so sad? Are you not happy at the sight of me?”“We are indeed happy, dear child, and we thank God for having sent us you in our great grief. But we cannot forget your two brothers; they were so handsome and brave, and worthy of a great destiny. And our sadness is increased when we remember that, instead of resting in their own country in the tomb of their forefathers, they sleep in an unknown land, perhaps without burial. Alas! it is three years since we had news of them.”At these words the child’s tears fell, and he embraced his parents and said, “Weep no more, dear parents, you shall soon be comforted: for before next spring I shall be a strong young man, and will look for my brothers all over the world. And I will bring them back to you, if not alive, yet dead: ay, though I have to seek them in the very centre of the earth.”At these words and at that which followed the king and queen were amazed. For the strange child, guided as it were by an invisible hand, rushed into the garden, and in spite of the cold, for it was not yet daylight, bathed in the early dew. When the sun had risen he threw himself down near a little wood on the fine sand, rubbed and rolled himself in it, and returned home, no longer a child but a youth.It was pleasant to the king to see his son thrive in this way, and indeed the young prince was the handsomest in the whole land. He grew from hour to hour. At the end of a month he could wield a sword, in two months he rode on horseback, in three months he had grown a beautiful moustache of pure gold. Then he put on a helmet, and presenting himself before the king and queen, said: “My much honoured parents, your son asks your blessing. I am no longer a child, and now go to seek my brothers. In order to find them I will, if necessary, go to the furthest ends of the world.”“Ah, do not venture. Stay rather with us, dear son, you are still too young to be exposed to the risks of such an undertaking.”“Adventures have no terrors for me,” replied the young hero, “I trust in God. Why should I for a moment hesitate to face these dangers? Whatever Destiny has in store for us will happen, whatever we may do to try to prevent it.”So they agreed to let him go. Weeping they bade him farewell, blessing him and the road he was to travel.A pleasant tale is soon told, but events do not pass so quickly.The young prince crossed deep rivers and climbed high mountains, till he came to a dark forest. In the distance he saw a cottage supported on a cock’s foot, and standing in the midst of a field full of poppies. As he made his ways towards it he was suddenly seized by an overpowering longing to sleep, but he urged on his horse, and breaking off the poppy heads as he galloped through the field, came up close to the house. Then he called out:“Little cot, turn around, on thy foot turn thou free;To the forest set thy back, let thy door be wide to me.”The cottage turned round with a great creaking noise, the door facing the prince. He entered, and found an old woman with thin white hair and a face covered with wrinkles, truly frightful to look upon. She was sitting at a table, her head resting on her hands, her eyes fixed on the ceiling, lost in deep thought. Near her were two beautiful girls, their complexions like lilies and roses, and in every way sweet to the eye.“Ah, how do you do, Prince with Moustache of Gold, Hero with the Golden Fist?” said old Yaga; “what has brought you here?”Having told her the object of his journey, she replied, “Your elder brothers perished on the mountain that touches the clouds, while in search of the Princess with the Golden Hair, who was carried off by Vikher, the hurricane.”“And how is this thief Vikher to be got at?” asked the prince.“Ah, my dear child, he would swallow you like a fly. It is now a hundred years since I went outside this cottage, for fear Vikher should seize me and carry me off to his palace near the sky.”“I am not afraid of his carrying me off, I am not handsome enough for that; and he will not swallow me either, for my golden hand can smash anything.”“Then if you are not afraid, my dove, I will help you to the best of my power. But give me your word of honour that you will bring me some of the Water of Youth, for it restores even to the most aged the beauty and freshness of youth.”“I give you my word of honour that I will bring you some.”“This then is what you must do. I will give you a pin-cushion for a guide; this you throw in front of you, and follow whithersoever it goes. It will lead you to the mountain that touches the clouds, and which is guarded in Vikher’s absence by his father and mother, the northern blast and the south wind. On no account lose sight of the pin-cushion. If attacked by the father, the northern blast, and suddenly seized with cold, then put on this heat-giving hood: if overpowered by burning heat of the south wind, then drink from this cooling flagon. Thus by means of the pin-cushion, the hood, and the flagon, you will reach the top of the mountain where the Princess with the Golden Hair is imprisoned. Deal with Vikher as you will, only remember to bring me some of the Water of Youth.”Our young hero took the heat-giving hood, the cooling flagon, and the pin-cushion, and, after bidding farewell to old Yaga and her two pretty daughters, mounted his steed and rode off, following the pin-cushion, which rolled before him at a great rate.Now a beautiful story is soon told, but the events of which it consists do not in real life take place so rapidly.When the prince had travelled through two kingdoms, he came to a land in which lay a very beautiful valley that stretched into the far distance, and above it towered the mountain that touches the sky. The summit was so high above the earth you might almost fancy it reached the moon.The prince dismounted, left his horse to graze, and having crossed himself began to follow the pin-cushion up steep and rocky paths. When he had got half-way there the north wind began to blow, and the cold was so intense that the wood of the trees split up and the breath froze: he felt chilled to the heart. But he quickly put on the heat-giving hood, and cried:“O Heat-Giving Hood, see I fly now to thee,Lend me quickly thine aid;O hasten to warm ere the cold has killed me,With thee I’m not afraid.”The northern blast blew with redoubled fury, but to no purpose. For the prince was so hot that he streamed with perspiration, and indeed was obliged to unbutton his coat and fan himself.Here the pin-cushion stopped upon a small snow-covered mound. The prince cleared away the snow, beneath which lay the frozen bodies of two young men, and he knew them to be those of his lost brothers. Having knelt beside them and prayed he turned to follow the pin-cushion, which had already started, and was rolling ever higher and higher. On reaching the top of the mountain he saw a silver palace supported on a cock’s foot, and at one of the windows, shining in the sun’s rays, a head of golden hair which could belong to no one but the princess. Suddenly a hot wind began to blow from the south, and the heat became so intense that leaves withered and dropped from the trees, the grass dried up, and large cracks appeared in several places of the earth’s surface. Thirst, heat, and weariness began to tell upon the young prince, so he took the cooling flagon from his pocket and cried:“Flagon, bring me quick reliefFrom this parching heat;In thy draught I have belief,Coolness it will mete.”After drinking deeply he felt stronger than ever, and so continued to ascend. Not only was he relieved from the great heat, but was even obliged to button up his coat to keep himself warm.The pin-cushion still led the way, ever climbing higher and higher, while the prince followed close behind. After crossing the region of clouds they came to the topmost peak of the mountain. Here the prince came close to the palace, which can only be likened to a dream of perfect beauty. It was supported on a cock’s foot, and was built entirely of silver, except for its steel gates and roof of solid gold. Before the entrance was a deep precipice over which none but the birds could pass. As the prince gazed upon the splendid building the princess leaned out of one of the windows, and seeing him light shone from her sparkling eyes, her lovely hair floated in the wind, and the scent of her sweet breath filled the air. The prince sprang forward and cried out:“Silver Palace, oh turn, on thy foot turn thou free,To the steep rocks thy back, but thy doors wide to me.”At these words it revolved creaking, the doorway facing the prince. As he entered it returned to its original position. The prince went through the palace till he came to a room bright as the sun itself, and the walls, floor, and ceiling of which consisted of mirrors. He was filled with wonder, for instead of one princess he saw twelve, all equally beautiful, with the same graceful movements and golden hair. But eleven were only reflections of the one real princess. She gave a cry of joy on seeing him, and running to meet him, said: “Ah, noble sir, you look like a delivering angel. Surely you bring me good news. From what family, city, or country have you come? Perhaps my dear father and mother sent you in search of me?”“No one has sent me, I have come of my own free will to rescue you and restore you to your parents.”When he had told her all that had passed she said, “Your devotion, prince, is very great; may God bless your attempt. But Vikher the hurricane is unconquerable, so, if life be dear to you, fly. Leave this place before his return, which I expect every minute; he will kill you with one glance of his eyes.”“If I should not succeed in saving you, sweet princess, life can be no longer dear to me. But I am full of hope, and I beg you first to give me some of the Strength-Giving Water from the Heroic Well, for this is drunk by the hurricane.”The princess drew a bucketful of water, which the young man emptied at one draught and then asked for another. This astonished her somewhat, but she gave it him, and when he had drunk it he said, “Allow me, princess, to sit down for a moment to take breath.”She gave him an iron chair, but directly he sat down it broke into a thousand pieces. She then brought him the chair used by Vikher himself, but although it was made of the strongest steel, it bent and creaked beneath the prince’s weight.“Now you see,” said he, “that I have grown heavier than your unconquerable hurricane: so take courage, with God’s help and your good wishes I shall overcome him. In the meantime tell me how you pass your time here.”“Alas! in bitter tears and sad reflections. My only consolation is that I have been able to keep my persecutor at a distance, for he vainly implores me to marry him. Two years have now passed away, and yet none of his efforts to win my consent have been successful. Last time he went away he told me that if on his return he had not guessed the riddles I set him (the correct explanation of these being the condition I have made for his marrying me), he would set them aside, and marry me in spite of my objections.”“Ah, then I am just in time. I will be the priest on that occasion, and give him Death for a bride.”At that moment a horrible whistling was heard.“Be on your guard, prince,” cried she, “here comes the hurricane.”The palace spun rapidly round, fearful sounds filled the building, thousands of ravens and birds of ill omen croaked loudly and flapped their wings, and all the doors opened with a tremendous noise.Vikher, mounted on his winged horse that breathed fire, leapt into the mirrored room, then stopped amazed at the sight before him. He was indeed the hurricane, with the body of a giant and the head of a dragon, and as he gazed his horse pranced and beat his wings.“What is your business here, stranger?” he shouted: and the sound of his voice was like unto a lion’s roar.“I am your enemy, and I want your blood,” replied the prince calmly.“Your boldness amuses me. At the same time, if you do not depart at once I will take you in my left hand and crush every bone in your body with my right.”“Try, if you dare, woman-stealer,” he answered.Vikher roared, breathing fire in his rage, and with his mouth wide open threw himself upon the prince, intending to swallow him. But the latter stepped lightly aside, and putting his golden hand down his enemy’s throat, seized him by the tongue and dashed him against the wall with such force that the monster bounded against it like a ball, and died within a few moments, shedding torrents of blood.The prince then drew from different springs the water that restores, that revives, and that makes young, and taking the unconscious girl in his arms he led the winged horse to the door and said:“Silver Palace, oh turn, on thy foot turn thou free,To the steep rocks thy back, the courtyard may I see.”Whereupon the palace creaked round on the cock’s foot, and the door opened on the courtyard. Mounting the horse he placed the princess before him, for she had by this time recovered from her swoon, and cried:“Fiery Horse with strength of wing,I am now your lord;Do my will in everything,Be your law my word.Where I point there you must goAt once, at once. The way you know.”And he pointed to the place where his brothers lay frozen in death. The horse rose, pranced, beat the air with his wings, then, lifting himself high in the air, came down gently where the two princes were lying. The Prince with the Golden Hand sprinkled their bodies with the Life-Restoring Water, and instantly the pallor of death disappeared, leaving in its place the natural colour. He then sprinkled them with the Water that Revives, after which they opened their eyes, got up, and looking round said, “How well we have slept: but what has happened? And how is it we see the lovely princess we sought in the society of a young man, a perfect stranger to us?”The Prince with the Golden Hand explained everything, embraced his brothers tenderly, and taking them with him on his horse, showed the latter that he wished to go in the direction of Yaga’s cottage. The horse rose up, pranced, lifted himself in the air, then, beating his wings far above the highest forests, descended close by the cottage. The prince said:“Little cot, turn around, on thy foot turn thou free,To the forest thy back, but thy door wide to me.”The cottage began to creak without delay, and turned round with the floor facing the travellers. Old Yaga was on the look-out, and came to meet them. As soon as she got the Water of Youth she sprinkled herself with it, and instantly everything about her that was old and ugly became young and charming. So pleased was she to be young again that she kissed the prince’s hands and said, “Ask of me anything you like, I will refuse you nothing.”At that moment her two beautiful young daughters happened to look out of the window, upon which the two elder princes, who were admiring them, said, “Will you give us your daughters for wives?”“That I will, with pleasure,” said she, and beckoned them to her. Then curtseying to her future sons-in-law, she laughed merrily and vanished. They placed their brides before them on the same horse, while the Prince with the Golden Hand, pointing to where he wished to go, said:“Fiery Horse with strength of wing,I am now your lord;Do my will in everything,Be your law my word.Where I point there you must goAt once, at once. The way you know.”The horse rose up, pranced, flapped his wings, and flew far above the forest. An hour or two later he descended before the palace of the Golden-Haired Princess’s parents. When the king and queen saw their only daughter who had so long been lost to them, they ran to meet her with exclamations of joy and kissed her gratefully and lovingly, at the same time thanking the prince who had restored her to them. And when they heard the story of his adventures they said: “You, Prince with the Golden Hand, shall receive our beloved daughter in marriage, with the half of our kingdom, and the right of succession to the remainder after us. Let us, too, add to the joy of this day by celebrating the weddings of your two brothers.”The Princess with the Golden Hair kissed her father lovingly and said, “My much honoured and noble sire and lord, the prince my bridegroom knows of the vow I made when carried off by the hurricane, that I would only give my hand to him who could answer aright my six enigmas: it would be impossible for the Princess with the Golden Hair to break her word.”The king was silent, but the prince said, “Speak, sweet princess, I am listening.”“This is my first riddle: ‘Two of my extremities form a sharp point, the two others a ring, in my centre is a screw.’”“A pair of scissors,” answered he.“Well guessed. This is the second: ‘I make the round of the table on only one foot, but if I am wounded the evil is beyond repair.’”“A glass of wine.”“Right. This is the third: ‘I have no tongue, and yet I answer faithfully; I am not seen, yet every one hears me.’”“True. This is the fourth: ‘Fire cannot light me; brush cannot sweep me; no painter can paint me; no hiding-place secure me.’”“Sunshine.”“The very thing. This is the fifth: ‘I existed before the creation of Adam. I am always changing in succession the two colours of my dress. Thousands of years have gone by, but I have remained unaltered both in colour and form.’”“It must be time, including day and night.”“You have succeeded in guessing the five most difficult, the last is the easiest of all. ‘By day a ring, by night a serpent; he who guesses this shall be my bridegroom.’”“It is a girdle.”“Now they are all guessed,” said she, and gave her hand to the young prince.They knelt before the king and queen to receive their blessing. The three weddings were celebrated that same evening, and a messenger mounted the winged horse to carry the good news to the parents of the young princes and to bring them back as guests. Meanwhile a magnificent feast was prepared, and invitations were sent to all their friends and acquaintances. And from that evening until the next morning they ceased not to feast and drink and dance. I too was a guest, and feasted with the rest; but though I ate and drank, the wine only ran down my beard, and my throat remained dry.","['live', 'king', 'queen', 'daughter', 'beauty', 'princess',

1041,slavic,The Sluggard,"On the banks of a certain river, where there was always good fishing, lived an old man and his three sons. The two eldest were sharp-witted, active young men, already married; the youngest was stupid and idle, and a bachelor. When the father was dying, he called his children to him and told them how he had left his property. The house was for his two married sons, with a sum of three hundred florins each. After his death he was buried with great pomp, and after the funeral there was a splendid feast. All these honours were supposed to be for the benefit of the man’s soul.When the elder brothers took possession of their inheritance, they said to the youngest: “Listen, brother; let us take charge of your share of the money, for we intend going out into the world as merchants, and when we have made a great deal of money we will buy you a hat, a sash, and a pair of red boots. You will be better at home; and mind you do as your sisters-in-law tell you.”For a long time this silly fellow had been wanting a cap, a sash, and a pair of red boots, so he was easily persuaded to give up all his money.The brothers set out on their travels, and crossed the sea in search of fortune. The “fool” of the family remained at home; and, as he was an out-and-out sluggard, he would lie whole days at a time on the warm stove without doing a stroke of work, and only obeying his sisters-in-law with the greatest reluctance. He liked fried onions, potato soup, and cider, better than anything else in the world.One day his sisters-in-law asked him to fetch them some water.It was winter, and a hard frost; moreover, the sluggard did not feel at all inclined to go out. So he said, “Go yourselves, I prefer to stay here by the fire.”“Stupid boy, go at once. We will have some onions, potato soup, and cider ready for you when you come back. If you refuse to do what we ask you we shall tell our husbands, and then there will be neither cap, sash, nor red boots for you.”At these words the sluggard thought he had better go. So he rolled off the stove, took a hatchet and a couple of pails, and went down to the river. On the surface of the water, where the ice had been broken, was a large pike. The sluggard seized him by the fins and pulled him out.“If you will let me go,” said the pike, “I promise to give you everything you wish for.”“Well then, I should like all my desires to be fulfilled the moment I utter them.”“You shall have everything you want the moment you pronounce these words:‘At my behest, and by the orders of the pike,May such and such things happen, as I like.’”“Just wait one moment while I try the effect,” said the sluggard, and began at once to say:“At my behest, and by the orders of the pike,Bring onions, cider, soup, just as I like.”That very moment his favourite dishes were before him. Having eaten a large quantity, he said, “Very good, very good indeed; but will it always be the same?”“Always,” replied the pike.The sluggard put the pike back into the river, and turning towards his buckets, said:“At my behest, and by the orders of the pike,Walk home yourselves, my pails—that I should like.”The pails, and the strong rod to which they were fastened, immediately set off and walked solemnly along, the sluggard following them with his hands in his pockets. When they reached the house he put them in their places, and again stretched himself out to enjoy the warmth of the stove. Presently the sisters-in-law said, “Come and chop some wood for us.”“Bother! do it yourselves.”“It is not fit work for women. Besides, if you don’t do it the stove will be cold, and then you will be the chief sufferer. Moreover, pay attention to what we say, for if you do not obey us, there will be no red boots, nor any other pretty things.”The sluggard then just sat up and said:“At my behest, and by the orders of the pike,Let what my sisters want be done—that’s what I like.”Instantly the hatchet came out from behind a stool and chopped up a large heap of wood, put a part of it on the stove, and retired to its corner. All this time the sluggard was eating and drinking at his ease.Another day some wood had to be brought from the forest. Our sluggard now thought he would like to show off before the villagers, so he pulled a sledge out of the shed, loaded it with onions and soup, after which he pronounced the magic words.The sledge started off, and passing through the village at a rattling pace, ran over several people, and frightened the women and children.When the forest was reached, our friend looked on while the blocks of wood and faggots cut, tied, and laid themselves on the sledge, after which they set off home again. But when they got to the middle of the village the men, who had been hurt and frightened in the morning, seized hold of the sluggard and pulled him off the sledge, dragging him along by the hair to give him a sound thrashing.At first he thought it was only a joke, but when the blows hurt his shoulders, he said:“At my behest, and by the orders of the pike,Come, faggots, haste, and my assailants strike.”In a moment all the blocks of wood and faggots jumped off the sledge and began to hit right and left, and they hit so well that the men were glad to get out of the way as best they could.The sluggard laughed at them till his sides ached; then he remounted his sledge, and was soon lying on the stove again.From that day he became famous, and his doings were talked about all through the country.At last even the king heard of him, and, his curiosity being aroused, he sent some of his soldiers to fetch him.“Now then, booby,” said the soldier, “come down off that stove and follow me to the king’s palace.”“Why should I? There is as much cider, onions, and soup as I want at home.”The man, indignant at his want of respect, struck him.Upon which the sluggard said:“At my behest, and by the orders of the pike,May this man get a taste of what a broom is like.”A large broom, and not particularly clean, immediately hopped up, and first dipping itself in a pail of water, beat the soldier so mercilessly that he was obliged to escape through the window, whence he returned to the king. His majesty, amazed at the sluggard’s refusal, sent another messenger. This man was ’cuter than his comrade, and first made inquiries as to the sluggard’s tastes. Then he went up to him and said, “Good-day, my friend; will you come with me to see the king? He wishes to present you with a cap, a waistband, and a pair of red boots.”“With the greatest pleasure; you go on, I will soon overtake you.”Then he ate as much as he could of his favourite dishes and went to sleep on the stove. He slept so long that at last his sisters-in-law woke him up and told him he would be late if he did not at once go to see the king. The lazy fellow said nothing but these words:“At my behest, and by the orders of the pike,This stove to carry me before the king I’d like.”At the very same instant the stove moved from its place and carried him right up to the palace door. The king was filled with amazement, and running out, followed by the whole court, asked the sluggard what he would like to have.“I have merely come to fetch the hat, waistband, and red boots you promised me.”Just then the charming princess Gapiomila came to find out what was going on. Directly the sluggard saw her, he thought her so enchanting that he whispered to himself:“At my behest, and by the orders of the pike,That this princess so fair may love me, I should like.”Then he ordered his stove to take him back home, and when there he continued to eat onions and soup and to drink cider.Meanwhile the princess had fallen in love with him, and begged her father to send for him again. As the sluggard would not consent, the king had him bound when asleep, and thus brought to the palace. Then he summoned a celebrated magician, who at his orders shut the princess and sluggard up in a crystal cask, to which was fastened a balloon well filled with gas, and sent it up in the air among the clouds. The princess wept bitterly, but the fool sat still and said he felt very comfortable. At last she persuaded him to exert his powers, so he said:“At my behest, and by the orders of the pike,This cask of crystal earth at once must strikeUpon the friendly island I should like.”The crystal cask immediately descended, and opened upon a hospitable island where travellers could have all they wanted by simply wishing for it. The princess and her companion walked about, eating when hungry, and drinking when athirst. The sluggard was very happy and contented, but the lady begged him to wish for a palace. Instantly the palace made its appearance. It was built of white marble, with crystal windows, roof of yellow amber, and golden furniture. She was delighted with it. Next day she wanted a good road made, along which she could go to see her father. Immediately there stretched before them a fairy-like bridge made of crystal, having golden balustrades set with diamonds, and leading right up to the king’s palace. The sluggard was just about to accompany the princess when he began to think of his own appearance, and to feel ashamed that such an awkward, stupid fellow as he should walk by the side of such a lovely and graceful creature. So he said:“At my behest, and by the orders of the pike,To be both handsome, wise, and clever I should like.”Suddenly he became as handsome, wise, and clever as it was possible to be. Then he got into a gorgeous carriage with Gapiomila, and they drove across the bridge that led to the king’s palace.There they were received with every mark of joy and affection. The king gave them his blessing, and they were married the same evening. An immense number of guests were invited to the wedding feast; I, too, was there, and drank freely of wine and hydromel. And this is the story I have done my best to tell you as faithfully as possible.","['bank', 'certain', 'river', 'always', 'good', 'fishing', 'live', 'three', 'eldest', 'sharp-witted', 'active',

1205,slavic,The Little Singing Frog - The Story of a Girl Whose Parents were Ashamed of Her,"There was once a poor laborer and his wife who had no children. Every day the woman would sigh and say:“If only we had a child!”Then the man would sigh, too, and say:“It would be pleasant to have a little daughter, wouldn’t it?”At last they went on a pilgrimage to a holy shrine and there they prayed God to give them a child.“Any kind of a child!” the woman prayed. “I’d be thankful for a child of our own even if it were a frog!”God heard their prayer and sent them a little daughter—not a little girl daughter, however, but a little frog daughter. They loved their little frog child dearly and played with her and laughed and clapped their hands as they watched her hopping about the house. But when the neighbors came in and whispered: “Why, that child of theirs is nothing but a frog!” they were ashamed and they decided that when people were about they had better keep their child hidden in a closet.So the frog girl grew up without playmates of her own age, seeing only her father and mother. She used to play about her father as he worked. He was a vine-dresser in a big vineyard and of course it was great fun for the little frog girl to hop about among the vines.Every day at noontime the woman used to come to the vineyard carrying her husband’s dinner in a basket. The years went by and she grew old and feeble and the daily trip to the vineyard began to tire her and the basket seemed to her to grow heavier and heavier.“Let me help you, mother,” the frog daughter said. “Let me carry father’s dinner to him and you sit home and rest.”So from that time on the frog girl instead of the old woman carried the dinner basket to the vineyard. While the old man ate, the frog girl would hop up into the branches of a tree and sing. She sang very sweetly and her old father, when he petted her, used to call her his Little Singing Frog.Now one day while she was singing the Tsar’s Youngest Son rode by and heard her. He stopped his horse and looked this way and that but for the life of him he couldn’t see who it was who was singing so sweetly.“Who is singing?” he asked the old man.But the old man who, as I told you before, was ashamed of his frog daughter before strangers, at first pretended not to hear and then, when the young Prince repeated his question, answered gruffly:“There’s no one singing!”But the next day at the same hour when the Prince was again riding by he heard the same sweet voice and he stopped again and listened.“Surely, old man,” he said, “there is some one singing! It is a lovely girl, I know it is! Why, if I could find her, I’d be willing to marry her at once and take her home to my father, the Tsar!”“Don’t be rash, young man,” the laborer said.“I mean what I say!” the Prince declared. “I’d marry her in a minute!”“Are you sure you would?”“Yes, I’m sure!”“Very well, then, we’ll see.”The old man looked up into the tree and called:“Come down, Little Singing Frog! A Prince wants to marry you!”So the little frog girl hopped down from among the branches and stood before the Prince.“She’s my own daughter,” the laborer said, “even if she does look like a frog.”“I don’t care what she looks like,” the Prince said. “I love her singing and I love her. And I mean what I say: I’ll marry her if she’ll marry me. My father, the Tsar, bids me and my brothers present him our brides to-morrow. He bids all the brides bring him a flower and he says he’ll give the kingdom to the prince whose bride brings the loveliest flower. Little Singing Frog, will you be my bride and will you come to Court to-morrow bringing a flower?”“Yes, my Prince,” the frog girl said, “I will. But I must not shame you by hopping to Court in the dust. I must ride. So, will you send me a snow-white cock from your father’s barnyard?”“I will,” the Prince promised, and before night the snow-white cock had arrived at the laborer’s cottage.Early the next morning the frog girl prayed to the Sun.“O golden Sun,” she said, “I need your help! Give me some lovely clothes woven of your golden rays for I would not shame my Prince when I go to Court.”The Sun heard her prayer and gave her a gown of cloth of gold.Instead of a flower she took a spear of wheat in her hand and then when the time came she mounted the white cock and rode to the palace.The guards at the palace gate at first refused to admit her.“This is no place for frogs!” they said to her. “You’re looking for a pond!”But when she told them she was the Youngest Prince’s bride, they were afraid to drive her away. So they let her ride through the gate.“Strange!” they murmured to one another. “The Youngest Prince’s bride! She looks like a frog and that was certainly a cock she was riding, wasn’t it?”They stepped inside the gates to look after her and then they saw an amazing sight. The frog girl, still seated on the white cock, was shaking out the folds of a golden gown. She dropped the gown over her head and instantly there was no frog and no white cock but a lovely maiden mounted on a snow-white horse!Well, the frog girl entered the palace with two other girls, the promised brides of the older princes. They were just ordinary girls both of them. To see them you wouldn’t have paid any attention to them one way or the other. But standing beside the lovely bride of the Youngest Prince they seemed more ordinary than ever.The first girl had a rose in her hand. The Tsar looked at it and at her, sniffed his nose slightly, and turned his head.The second girl had a carnation. The Tsar looked at her for a moment and murmured:“Dear me, this will never do!”Then he looked at the Youngest Prince’s bride and his eye kindled and he said:“Ah! This is something like!”“This, the bride of the youngest prince, is my choice.” Illustration by JaY Van Everen, published in The Laughing Prince: Jugoslav Folk and Fairy Tales by Parker Fillmore (1921), Harcourt, Brace and Company.She gave him the spear of wheat and he took it and held it aloft. Then he reached out his other hand to her and had her stand beside him as he said to his sons and all the Court:“This, the bride of the Youngest Prince, is my choice! See how beautiful she is! And yet she knows the useful as well as the beautiful for she has brought me a spear of wheat! The Youngest Prince shall be the Tsar after me and she shall be Tsarina!”So the little frog girl of whom her parents were ashamed married the Youngest Prince and when the time came wore a Tsarina’s crown.","['poor', 'laborer', 'wife', 'child', 'every', 'woman', 'would', 'sigh', 'child', 'would', 'sigh', 'would', 'pleasant', 'little', 'daughter', 'last', 'pilgrimage', 'holy', 'shrine', 'prayed',

1242,slavic,The Maid with Hair of Gold,"There was once a king so wise and clever that he understood the language of all animals. You shall hear how he gained this power.One day an old woman came to the palace and said, “I wish to speak to his majesty, for I have something of great importance to tell him.” When admitted to his presence she presented him with a curious fish, saying, “Have it cooked for yourself, and when you have eaten it you will understand all that is said by the birds of the air, the animals that walk the earth, and the fishes that live under the waters.”The king was delighted to know that which every one else was ignorant of, so he rewarded the old woman generously, and told a servant to cook the fish very carefully.“But take care,” said the monarch, “that you do not taste it yourself, for if you do you will be killed.”George, the servant, was astonished at such a threat, and wondered why his master was so anxious that no one else should eat any of the fish. Then examining it curiously he said, “Never in all my life have I seen such an odd-looking fish; it seems more like a reptile. Now where would be the harm if I did take some? Every cook tastes of the dishes he prepares.”When it was fried he tasted a small piece, and while taking some of the sauce heard a buzzing in the air and a voice speaking in his ear.“Let us taste a crumb: let us taste a little,” it said.He looked round to see where the words came from, but there were only a few flies buzzing about in the kitchen. At the same moment some one out in the yard said in a harsh jerky voice, “Where are we going to settle? Where?”And another answered, “In the miller’s barley-field; ho! for the miller’s field of barley.”When George looked towards where this strange talk came he saw a gander flying at the head of a flock of geese.“How lucky,” thought he; “now I know why my master set so much value on this fish and wished to eat it all himself.”George had now no doubt that by tasting the fish he had learnt the language of animals, so after having taken a little more he served the king with the remainder as if nothing had happened.When his majesty had dined he ordered George to saddle two horses and accompany him for a ride. They were soon off, the master in front, the servant behind.While crossing a meadow George’s horse began to prance and caper, neighing out these words, “I say, brother, I feel so light and in such good spirits to-day that in one single bound I could leap over those mountains yonder.”“I could do the same,” answered the king’s horse, “but I carry a feeble old man on my back; he would fall like a log and break his skull.”“What does that matter to you? So much the better if he should break his head, for then, instead of being ridden by an old man you would probably be mounted by a young one.”The servant laughed a good deal upon hearing this conversation between the horses, but he took care to do so on the quiet, lest the king should hear him. At that moment his majesty turned round, and, seeing a smile on the man’s face, asked the cause of it.“Oh nothing, your majesty, only some nonsense that came into my head.”The king said nothing, and asked no more questions, but he was suspicious, and distrusted both servant and horses; so he hastened back to the palace.When there he said to George, “Give me some wine, but mind you only pour out enough to fill the glass, for if you put in one drop too much, so that it overflows, I shall certainly order my executioner to cut off your head.”While he was speaking two birds flew near the window, one chasing the other, who carried three golden hairs in his beak.“Give them me,” said one, “you know they are mine.”“Not at all, I picked them up myself.”“No matter, I saw them fall while the Maid with Locks of Gold was combing out her hair. At least, give me two, then you can keep the third for yourself.”“No, not a single one.”Thereupon one of the birds succeeded in seizing the hairs from the other bird’s beak, but in the struggle he let one fall, and it made a sound as if a piece of metal had struck the ground. As for George, he was completely taken off his guard, and the wine overflowed the glass.The king was furious, and feeling convinced that his servant had disobeyed him and had learnt the language of animals, he said, “You scoundrel, you deserve death for having failed to do my bidding, nevertheless, I will show you mercy upon one condition, that you bring me the Maid with the Golden Locks, for I intend to marry her.”Alas, what was to be done? Poor fellow, he was willing to do anything to save his life, even run the risk of losing it on a long journey. He therefore promised to search for the Maid with the Golden Locks: but he knew not where or how to find her.When he had saddled and mounted his horse he allowed it to go its own way, and it carried him to the outskirts of a dark forest, where some shepherds had left a bush burning. The sparks of fire from the bush endangered the lives of a large number of ants which had built their nest close by, and the poor little things were hurrying away in all directions, carrying their small white eggs with them.“Help us in our distress, good George,” they cried in a plaintive voice; “do not leave us to perish, together with our children whom we carry in these eggs.”George immediately dismounted, cut down the bush, and put out the fire.“Thank you, brave man: and remember, when you are in trouble you have only to call upon us, and we will help you in our turn.” The young fellow went on his way far into the forest until he came to a very tall fir tree. At the top of the tree was a raven’s nest, while at the foot, on the ground, lay two young ones who were calling out to their parents and saying, “Alas, father and mother, where have you gone? You have flown away, and we have to seek our food, weak and helpless as we are. Our wings are as yet without feathers, how then shall we be able to get anything to eat? Good George,” said they, turning to the young man, “do not leave us to starve.”Without stopping to think, the young man dismounted, and with his sword slew his horse to provide food for the young birds. They thanked him heartily, and said, “If ever you should be in distress, call to us and we will help you at once.”After this George was obliged to travel on foot, and he walked on for a long time, ever getting further and further into the forest. On reaching the end of it, he saw stretching before him an immense sea that seemed to mingle with the horizon. Close by stood two men disputing the possession of a large fish with golden scales that had fallen into their net.“The net belongs to me,” said one, “therefore the fish must be mine.”“Your net would not have been of the slightest use, for it would have been lost in the sea, had I not come with my boat just in the nick of time.”“Well, you shall have the next haul I make.”“And suppose you should catch nothing? No; give me this one and keep the next haul for yourself.”“I am going to put an end to your quarrel,” said George, addressing them. “Sell me the fish: I will pay you well, and you can divide the money between you.”Thereupon he put into their hands all the money the king had given him for the journey, without keeping a single coin for himself. The fishermen rejoiced at the good fortune which had befallen them, but George put the fish back into the water. The fish, thankful for this unexpected freedom, dived and disappeared, but returning to the surface, said, “Whenever you may need my help you have but to call me, I shall not fail to show my gratitude.”“Where are you going?” asked the fisherman.“I am in search of a wife for my old master; she is known as the Maid with the Golden Locks: but I am at a loss where to find her.”“If that be all, we can easily give you information,” answered they. “She is Princess Zlato Vlaska, and daughter of the king whose crystal palace is built on that island yonder. The golden light from the princess’s hair is reflected on sea and sky every morning when she combs it. If you would like to go to the island we will take you there for nothing, in return for the clever and generous way by which you made us stop quarrelling. But beware of one thing: when in the palace do not make a mistake as to which is the princess, for there are twelve of them, but only Zlato Vlaska has hair of gold.”When George reached the island he lost no time in making his way to the palace, and demanded from the king the hand of his daughter, Princess Zlato Vlaska, in marriage to the king his master.“I will grant the request with pleasure,” said his majesty, “but only on one condition, namely, that you perform certain tasks which I will set you. These will be three in number, and must be done in three days, just as I order you. For the present you had better rest and refresh yourself after your journey.”On the next day the king said, “My daughter, the Maid with the Golden Hair, had a string of fine pearls, and the thread having broken, the pearls were scattered far and wide among the long grass of this field. Go and pick up every one of the pearls, for they must all be found.”George went into the meadow, which was of great length and stretched away far out of sight. He went down on his knees and hunted between the tufts of grass and bramble from morning until noon, but not a single pearl could he find.“Ah, if I only had my good little ants here,” he cried, “they would be able to help me.”“Here we are, young man, at your service,” answered the ants, suddenly appearing. Then they all ran round him, crying out, “What is the matter? What do you want?”“I have to find all the pearls lost in this field, and cannot see a single one: can you help me?”“Wait a little, we will soon get them for you.”He had not to wait very long, for they brought him a heap of pearls, and all he had to do was to thread them on the string. Just as he was about to make a knot he saw a lame ant coming slowly towards him, for one of her feet had been burned in the bush fire.“Wait a moment, George,” she called out; “do not tie the knot before threading this last pearl I am bringing you.”When George took his pearls to the king, his majesty first counted them to make sure they were all there, and then said, “You have done very well in this test, to-morrow I will give you another.”Early next morning the king summoned George to him and said, “My daughter, the Princess with the Golden Hair, dropped her gold ring into the sea while bathing. You must find the jewel and bring it me to-day.”The young fellow walked thoughtfully up and down the beach. The water was pure and transparent, but he could not see beyond a certain distance into its depths, and therefore could not tell where the ring was lying beneath the water.“Ah, my golden fishling, why are you not here now? You would surely be able to help me,” he said to himself, speaking aloud.“Here I am,” answered the fish’s voice from the sea, “what can I do for you?”“I have to find a gold ring which has been dropped in the sea, but as I cannot see to the bottom there is no use looking.”The fish said, “Fortunately I have just met a pike, wearing a gold ring on his fin. Just wait a moment, will you?”In a very short time he reappeared with the pike and the ring. The pike willingly gave up the jewel.The king thanked George for his cleverness, and then told him the third task. “If you really wish me to give the hand of my daughter with the golden hair to the monarch who has sent you here, you must bring me two things that I want above everything: the Water of Death and the Water of Life.”George had not the least idea where to find these waters, so he determined to trust to chance and “follow his nose,” as the saying is. He went first in one direction and then in another, until he reached a dark forest.“Ah, if my little ravens were but here, perhaps they would help me,” he said aloud.Suddenly there was heard a rushing noise, as of wings overhead, and then down came the ravens calling “Krâk, krâk, here we are, ready and willing to help you. What are you looking for?”“I want some of the Water of Death and the Water of Life: it is impossible for me to find them, for I don’t know where to look.”“Krâk, krâk, we know very well where to find some. Wait a moment.”Off they went immediately, but soon returned, each with a small gourd in his beak. One gourd contained the Water of Life, the other the Water of Death.George was delighted with his success, and went back on his way to the palace. When nearly out of the forest, he saw a spider’s web hanging between two fir trees, while in the centre was a large spider devouring a fly he had just killed. George sprinkled a few drops of the Water of Death on the spider; it immediately left the fly, which rolled to the ground like a ripe cherry, but on being touched with the Water of Life she began to move, and stretching out first one limb and then another, gradually freed herself from the spider’s web. Then she spread her wings and took flight, having first buzzed these words in the ears of her deliverer: “George, you have assured your own happiness by restoring mine, for without my help you would never have succeeded in recognising the Princess with the Golden Hair when you choose her to-morrow from among her twelve sisters.”And the fly was right, for though the king, on finding that George had accomplished the third task, agreed to give him his daughter Zlato Vlaska, he yet added that he would have to find her himself.He then led him to a large room and bade him choose from among the twelve charming girls who sat at a round table. Each wore a kind of linen head-dress that completely hid the upper part of the head, and in such a way that the keenest eye could not discover the colour of the hair.“Here are my daughters,” said the king, “but only one among them has golden hair. If you find her you may take her with you; but if you make a mistake she will remain with us, and you will have to return empty-handed.”George felt much embarrassed, not knowing what course to take.“Buzz, Buzz, come walk round these young girls, and I will tell you which is yours.”Thus spoke the fly whose life George had saved.Thus reassured he walked boldly round, pointing at them one after the other and saying, “This one has not the golden hair, nor this one either, nor this….”Suddenly, having been told by the fly, he cried, “Here we are: this is Zlato Vlaska, even she herself. I take her for my own, she whom I have won, and for whom I have paid the price with many cares. You will not refuse her me this time.”“Indeed, you have guessed aright,” replied the king.The princess rose from her seat, and letting fall her head-dress, exposed to full view all the splendour of her wonderful hair, which seemed like a waterfall of golden rays, and covered her from head to foot. The glorious light that shone from it dazzled the young man’s eyes, and he immediately fell in love with her.The king provided his daughter with gifts worthy of a queen, and she left her father’s palace in a manner befitting a royal bride. The journey back was accomplished without any mishaps.On their arrival the old king was delighted at the sight of Zlato Vlaska, and danced with joy. Splendid and costly preparations were made for the wedding. His majesty then said to George, “You robbed me of the secret of animal language. For this I intended to have your head cut off and your body thrown to birds of prey. But as you have served me so faithfully and won the princess for my bride I will lessen the punishment—that is, although you will be executed, yet you shall be buried with all the honours worthy of a superior officer.”So the sentence was carried out, cruelly and unjustly. After the execution the Princess with the Golden Hair begged the king to make her a present of George’s body, and the monarch was so much in love that he could not refuse his intended bride anything.Zlato Vlaska with her own hands replaced the head on the body, and sprinkled it with the Water of Death. Immediately the separated parts became one again. Upon this she poured the Water of Life, and George returned to life, fresh as a young roebuck, his face radiant with health and youth.“Ah me! How well I have slept,” said he, rubbing his eyes.“Yes; no one could have slept better,” answered the princess, smiling, “but without me you would have slept through eternity.”When the old king saw George restored to life, and looking younger, handsomer, and more vigorous than ever, he too wanted to be made young again. He therefore ordered his servants to cut off his head and sprinkle it with the Life-Giving Water. They cut it off, but he did not come to life again, although they sprinkled his body with all the water that was left. Perhaps they made some mistake in using the wrong water, for the head and body were joined, but life itself never returned, there being no Water of Life left for that purpose. No one knew where to get any, and none understood the language of animals.So, to make a long story short, George was proclaimed king, and the Princess with Hair of Gold, who really loved him, became his queen.","['king', 'wise', 'clever', 'understood', 'language', 'animal', 'shall', 'hear', 'gain', 'power', 'woman', 'come', 'palace', 'wish', 'speak', 'majesty', 'something', 'great', 'importance',

1244,slavic,Two in a Sack,"What a life that poor man led with his wife, to be sure! Not a day passed without her scolding him and calling him names, and indeed sometimes she would take the broom from behind the stove and beat him with it. He had no peace or comfort at all, and really hardly knew how to bear it.One day, when his wife had been particularly unkind and had beaten him black and blue, he strolled slowly into the fields, and as he could not endure to be idle he spread out his nets.What kind of bird do you think he caught in his net? He caught a crane, and the crane said, ‘Let me go free, and I’ll show myself grateful.’The man answered, ‘No, my dear fellow. I shall take you home, and then perhaps my wife won’t scold me so much.’Said the crane: ‘You had better come with me to my house,’ and so they went to the crane’s house.When they got there, what do you think the crane took from the wall? He took down a sack, and he said:‘Two out of a sack!’Instantly two pretty lads sprang out of the sack. They brought in oak tables, which they spread with silken covers, and placed all sorts of delicious dishes and refreshing drinks on them. The man had never seen anything so beautiful in his life, and he was delighted.Then the crane said to him, ‘Now take this sack to your wife.’The man thanked him warmly, took the sack, and set out.His home was a good long way off, and as it was growing dark, and he was feeling tired, he stopped to rest at his cousin’s house by the way.The cousin had three daughters, who laid out a tempting supper, but the man would eat nothing, and said to his cousin, ‘Your supper is bad.’‘Oh, make the best of it,’ said she, but the man only said: ‘Clear away!’ and taking out his sack he cried, as the crane had taught him:‘Two out of the sack!’And out came the two pretty boys, who quickly brought in the oak tables, spread the silken covers, and laid out all sorts of delicious dishes and refreshing drinks.Never in their lives had the cousin and her daughters seen such a supper, and they were delighted and astonished at it. But the cousin quietly made up her mind to steal the sack, so she called to her daughters: ‘Go quickly and heat the bathroom: I am sure our dear guest would like to have a bath before he goes to bed.’When the man was safe in the bathroom she told her daughters to make a sack exactly like his, as quickly as possible. Then she changed the two sacks, and hid the man’s sack away.The man enjoyed his bath, slept soundly, and set off early next morning, taking what he believed to be the sack the crane had given him.All the way home he felt in such good spirits that he sang and whistled as he walked through the wood, and never noticed how the birds were twittering and laughing at him.As soon as he saw his house he began to shout from a distance, ‘Hallo! old woman! Come out and meet me!’His wife screamed back: ‘You come here, and I’ll give you a good thrashing with the poker!’The man walked into the house, hung his sack on a nail, and said, as the crane had taught him:‘Two out of the sack!’But not a soul came out of the sack.Then he said again, exactly as the crane had taught him:‘Two out of the sack!’His wife, hearing him chattering goodness knows what, took up her wet broom and swept the ground all about him.The man took flight and rushed oft into the field, and there he found the crane marching proudly about, and to him he told his tale.‘Come back to my house,’ said the crane, and so they went to the crane’s house, and as soon as they got there, what did the crane take down from the wall? Why, he took down a sack, and he said:‘Two out of the sack!’And instantly two pretty lads sprang out of the sack, brought in oak tables, on which they laid silken covers, and spread all sorts of delicious dishes and refreshing drinks on them.‘Take this sack,’ said the crane.The man thanked him heartily, took the sack, and went. He had a long way to walk, and as he presently got hungry, he said to the sack, as the crane had taught him:‘Two out of the sack!’And instantly two rough men with thick sticks crept out of the bag and began to beat him well, crying as they did so:‘Don’t boast to your cousins of what you have got, One–two– Or you’ll find you will catch it uncommonly hot, One–two–‘And they beat on till the man panted out:‘Two into the sack.’The words were hardly out of his mouth, when the two crept back into the sack.Then the man shouldered the sack, and went off straight to his cousin’s house. He hung the sack up on a nail, and said: ‘Please have the bathroom heated, cousin.’The cousin heated the bathroom, and the man went into it, but he neither washed nor rubbed himself, he just sat there and waited.Meantime his cousin felt hungry, so she called her daughters, and all four sat down to table. Then the mother said:‘Two out of the sack.’Instantly two rough men crept out of the sack, and began to beat the cousin as they cried: ‘Greedy pack! Thievish pack!One–two– Give the peasant back his sack!And they went on beating till the woman called to her eldest daughter: ‘Go and fetch your cousin from the bathroom. Tell him these two ruffians are beating me black and blue.’‘I’ve not finished rubbing myself yet,’ said the peasant.And the two ruffians kept on beating as they sang:‘Greedy pack! Thievish pack! One–two– Give the peasant back his sack!Then the woman sent her second daughter and said: ‘Quick, quick, get him to come to me.’‘I’m just washing my head,’ said the man.Then she sent the youngest girl, and he said: ‘I’ve not done drying myself.’At last the woman could hold out no longer, and sent him the sack she had stolen.NOW he had quite finished his bath, and as he left the bathroom he cried:‘Two into the sack.’And the two crept back at once into the sack.Then the man took both sacks, the good and the bad one, and went away home.When he was near the house he shouted: ‘Hallo, old woman, come and meet me!’His wife only screamed out:‘You broomstick, come here! Your back shall pay for this.’The man went into the cottage, hung his sack on a nail, and said, as the crane had taught him:‘Two out of the sack.’Instantly two pretty lads sprang out of the sack, brought in oak tables, laid silken covers on them, and spread them with all sorts of delicious dishes and refreshing drinks.The woman ate and drank, and praised her husband.‘Well, now, old man, I won’t beat you any more,’ said she.When they had done eating, the man carried off the good sack, and put it away in his store-room, but hung the bad sack up on the nail. Then he lounged up and down in the yard.Meantime his wife became thirsty. She looked with longing eyes at the sack, and at last she said, as her husband had done:‘Two out of the sack.’And at once the two rogues with their big sticks crept out of the sack, and began to belabour her as they sang:‘Would you beat your husband true?Don’t cry so! Now we’ll beat you black and blue! Oh! Oh!’The woman screamed out: ‘Old man, old man! Come here, quick! Here are two ruffians pommelling me fit to break my bones.’Her husband only strolled up and down and laughed, as he said: ‘Yes, they’ll beat you well, old lady.’And the two thumped away and sang again:‘Blows will hurt, remember, crone, We mean you well, we mean you well; In future leave the stick alone,For how it hurts, you now can tell, One–two–‘At last her husband took pity on her, and cried:‘Two into the sack.’He had hardly said the words before they were back in the sack again.From this time the man and his wife lived so happily together that it was a pleasure to see them, and so the story has an end.","['life', 'poor', 'lead', 'wife', 'sure', 'pass', 'without', 'scold', 'call', 'name', 'indeed', 'sometimes', 'would', 'take', 'broom', 'behind', 'stove', 'beat', 'peace',

1323,slavic,Right Always Remains Right,"There was once upon a time a huntsman, who had a son, who was also a huntsman. He sent his son into a foreign land, to look about him and learn something additional. Here he went into a tavern, where he found a stranger, with whom he entered into conversation. They told each other all the news, till they also began to talk about right and wrong. The stranger asserted that the greatest wrong could be made right for money. But the huntsman opined that right always remained right, and offered to bet three hundred dollars upon it, if the stranger would do the same.The stranger was content therewith, and they agreed to ask three advocates the question at once. They went to the first advocate, and he said that it was possible to make wrong right for money. They then went to another. He also asserted that wrong could be made right for money. Finally, they went to a third. He also told them that wrong could be made right for money. They then went back again, and as they had been going about the whole day, it wasn’t till late in the evening that they got to their tavern. The stranger then asked the huntsman whether he still disbelieved that the greatest wrong could be made right for money, and the huntsman replied that he should soon be obliged to believe it on the assertion of the three advocates, although he was very unwilling to do so. The stranger was willing to grant him his life if he consented to pay three hundred dollars; but as they were talking about it, in came a man who overpersuaded the stranger that he must needs abide by what they had previously agreed upon. He did not, however, do this, but only, with a red-hot iron, took his eyesight from him, and told him at the same time, that he would then and then only believe that right remained right in the world, when the huntsman regained his sight.The huntsman entreated the host of the tavern to put him on the right road to the town. He put him on the road to the gallows, and went his way. When the huntsman had gone a little further, there was the end of the road, and he heard it strike eleven. He couldn’t go any further, and remained lying where he was in hope that perhaps somebody would come there in the morning. After a short time he heard a clatter, and soon somebody came up; nor was it long before a second and a third arrived. These were three evil spirits, who quitted their bodies in the night time, and perpetrated all manner of villainy in the world. They began to talk together, and one said: ‘To-day it is a year and a day since we were here together and related the good deeds that we had done during the year before. A year has again elapsed, and it is therefore time that we should ascertain which of us has done the best action during the past year.’The first spoke, and said: ‘I have deprived the inhabitants of the city of Ramul of their water supply; they can only be helped if somebody finds out what it is that stops up the spring.’ ‘What’s that?’ said the second; and the first replied: ‘I have placed a great toad on the spring out of which the water at other times flowed; if that be removed, the water will spring up again as before.’ The second said: ‘I have caused the beauty of the princess of Sarahawsky to disappear, and herself to fade away to skin and bones; she cannot be helped until the silver nail, which hangs above her bed, be pulled out.’ The third said: Yesterday I caused a person to be deprived of his eyesight with a red hot iron; he can only be helped by washing his eyes with the water that is in the well not far from this gallows.’ It then struck twelve in the town, and the three disappeared at once, but the huntsman remembered all that he had heard, and rejoiced that it was in his power to regain his eyesight.Early on the morrow he heard somebody passing by, and begged him to send him people from the town, to tell where the healing spring was. Then all manner of people came to him, but no one could show him the spring, save at length one old woman. He caused himself to be led thither, and as soon as he had washed his eyes in it, he immediately obtained his eyesight again.He now asked the way to the city of Ramul, and went thither. As soon as he arrived, he told the town council that he would restore them their water. But plenty of people had been there already, and the city had spent a great deal of money upon them, yet no one had effected aught, so, as it had been all in vain, they intended to have nothing more to do with the matter. Well, he said that he would do it all for nothing, only they must give him some labourers to help him. It was done. When they had dug as far as the place where the pipes, through which the water used to flow, were laid into the spring, he sent all the work-men away and dug a little further himself, and behold! a toad, like a boiler, was sitting on the spring. He removed it, and immediately the water began to flow, and ere long all the fountains were filled with water. The citizens got up a grand banquet in his honour, and paid him a large sum of money for what he had done.He then went on and came to Sarahawsky. Then in a short time he learnt that the princess was ill, just as he had heard, and that no physician was able to help her; moreover that the king had promised that the person who could cure her malady should obtain her to wife. He therefore equipped himself very handsomely, went to the king’s palace, and there declared that he had come from a far country, and would cure the princess. The king replied to him that he had scarce any hope left, but would nevertheless make the experiment with him. The huntsman said that he would fetch his medicine. He went out and bought all manner of sweet comfits, and then went to the princess. He gave her a first dose, and looked about to see in what part of her bed’s head the silver nail was sticking. Early on the second day he came again, gave her again some of his medicine, took the opportunity of laying hold of the nail, and pulled it till it began to move. In the afternoon the princess felt that she was better. The third day he came again, and while the princess was taking the medicine, pulled again at the bed’s head, pulled the nail clean out, and put it secretly into his pocket. At noon the princess was so far recovered, that she wanted to have her dinner, and the king invited the huntsman to a grand banquet. They settled when the wedding was to take place, but the huntsman considered that he must first go home.And when he had got home, he went again to the tavern where he had lost the sight of his eyes, and the stranger was there also. They began to tell each other all the news, and the huntsman related what he had heard under the gallows; how he had discovered the water, and finally how he had regained the sight of his eyes, and said that the stranger must now believe that in the world right always remained right. The stranger marvelled exceedingly, and said that he would believe it.After this the huntsman went on and came to his princess, and they had a grand wedding festival, which lasted a whole week. The stranger bethought himself that he, too, would go under the gallows; peradventure he might also hear some such things as the huntsman had heard, and might in consequence also obtain a princess to wife. And when the year had elapsed, he also went there. He heard it strike one, and in a short time he heard a clatter; then up came somebody again, and it wasn’t long before a second and third arrived. They began to talk together, and one said: ‘It cannot but be, that some one overheard us last year, and through that everything that we have done is ruined. Let us, therefore, make a careful search before we again recount to each other what we have done.’ They immediately began to search, and found the stranger. They tore him into three pieces and hung them up on the three corners of the gallows.When the old king died they took the huntsman for king, and if he has not died, he is reigning still at the present day, and firmly believes that in his realm right will always remain right.","['upon', 'time', 'little', 'girl', 'beautiful', 'like', 'gazelle', 'hair', 'soft', 'wave', 'deep', 'shadow', 'night',

1333,slavic,The Death of Koshchei the Deathless,"In a certain kingdom there lived a Prince Ivan. He had three sisters. The first was the Princess Marya, the second the Princess Olga, the third the Princess Anna. When their father and mother lay at the point of death, they had thus enjoined their son: `Give your sisters in marriage to the very first suitors who come to woo them. Don’t go keeping them by you!’They died, and the Prince buried them, and then, to solace his grief, he went with his sisters into the garden green to stroll. Suddenly the sky was covered by a black cloud; a terrible storm arose.`Let us go home, sisters!’ he cried.Hardly had they got into the palace, when the thunder pealed, the ceiling split open, and into the room where they were came flying a falcon bright. The Falcon smote upon the ground, became a brave youth, and said:`Hail, Prince Ivan! Before I came as a guest, but now I have come as a wooer! I wish to propose for your sister, the Princess Marya.’`If you find favour in the eyes of my sister, I will not interfere with her wishes. Let her marry you, in God’s name!’The Princess Marya gave her consent; the Falcon married her and bore her away into his own realm.Days follow days, hours chase hours; a whole year goes by. One day Prince Ivan and his two sisters went out to stroll in the garden green. Again there arose a storm-cloud, with whirlwind and lightning.`Let us go home, sisters!’ cries the Prince. Scarcely had they entered the palace when the thunder crashed, the roof burst into a blaze, the ceiling split in twain, and in flew an eagle. The Eagle smote upon the ground and became a brave youth.`Hail, Prince Ivan! I Before I came as a guest, but now I have come as a wooer!’And he asked for the hand of the Princess Olga. Prince Ivan replied:`If you find favour in the eyes of the Princess Olga, then let her marry you. I will not interfere with her liberty of choice.’The Princess Olga gave her consent and married the Eagle. The Eagle took her and carried her off to his own kingdom.Another year went by. Prince Ivan said to his youngest sister:`Let us go out and stroll in the garden green!’They strolled about for a time. Again there arose a storm-cloud, with whirlwind and lightning.`Let us return home, sister!’ said he.They returned home, but they hadn’t had time to sit down when the thunder crashed, the ceiling split open, and in flew a raven. The Raven smote upon the floor and became a brave youth. The former youths had been handsome, but this one was handsomer still.`Well, Prince Ivan! Before I came as a guest, but now I have come as a wooer! Give me the Princess Anna to wife.’`I won’t interfere with my sister’s freedom. If you gain her affections, let her marry you.’So the Princess Anna married the Raven, and he bore her away into his own realm. Prince Ivan was left alone. A whole year he lived without his sisters; then he grew weary, and said:`I will set out in search of my sisters.’He got ready for the journey, he rode and rode, and one day he saw a whole army lying dead on the plain. He cried aloud, `If there be a living man there, let him make answer! Who has slain this mighty host?’There replied unto him a living man:`All this mighty host has been slain by the fair Princess Marya Morevna.’Prince Ivan rode further on, and came to a white tent, and forth came to meet him the fair Princess Marya Morevna.`Hail, Prince!’ says she; `whither does God send you? and is it of your free will or against your will?’Prince Ivan replied, `Not against their will do brave youths ride!’`Well, if your business be not pressing, tarry awhile in my tent.’Thereat was Prince Ivan glad. He spent two nights in the tent, and he found favour in the eyes of Marya Morevna, and she married him. The fair Princess, Marya Morevna, carried him off into her own realm.They spent some time together, and then the Princess took it into her head to go a warring. So she handed over all the house- keeping affairs to Prince Ivan, and gave him these instructions:`Go about everywhere, keep watch over everything; only do not venture to look into that closet there.’He couldn’t help doing so. The moment Marya Morevna had gone he rushed to the closet, pulled open the door, and looked in– there hung Koshchei the Deathless, fettered by twelve chains. Then Koshchei entreated Prince Ivan, saying:`Have pity upon me and give me to drink! Ten years long have I been here in torment, neither eating nor drinking; my throat is utterly dried up.’The Prince gave him a bucketful of water; he drank it up and asked for more, saying:`A single bucket of water will not quench my thirst; give me more!’The Prince gave him a second bucketful. Koshchei drank it up and asked for a third, and when he had swallowed the third bucketful, he regained his former strength, gave his chains a shake, and broke all twelve at once.`Thanks, Prince Ivan!’ cried Koshchei the Deathless, `now you will sooner see your own ears than Marya Morevna!’ and out of the window he flew in the shape of a terrible whirlwind. And he came up with the fair Princess Marya Morevna as she was going her way, laid hold of her and carried her off home with him. But Prince Ivan wept full sore, and he arrayed himself and set out a- wandering, saying to himself, `Whatever happens, I will go and look for Marya Morevna!’One day passed, another day passed; at the dawn of the third day he saw a wondrous palace, and by the side of the palace stood an oak, and on the oak sat a falcon bright. Down flew the Falcon from the oak, smote upon the ground, turned into a brave youth, and cried aloud:`Ha, dear brother-in-law! how deals the Lord with you?’Out came running the Princess Marya, joyfully greeted her brother Ivan, and began inquiring after his health, and telling him all about herself. The Prince spent three days with them; then he said:`I cannot abide with you; I must go in search of my wife, the fair Princess Marya Morevna.’`Hard will it be for you to find her,’ answered the Falcon. `At all events leave with us your silver spoon. We will look at it and remember you.’ So Prince Ivan left his silver spoon at the Falcon’s, and went on his way again.On he went one day, on he went another day, and by the dawn of the third day he saw a palace still grander than the former one and hard by the palace stood an oak, and on the oak sat an eagle. Down flew the Eagle from the oak, smote upon the ground, turned into a brave youth, and cried aloud:`Rise up, Princess Olga! Hither comes our brother dear!’The Princess Olga immediately ran to meet him, and began kissing him and embracing him, asking after his health, and telling him all about herself. With them Prince Ivan stopped three days; then he said:`I cannot stay here any longer. I am going to look for my wife, the fair Princess Marya Morevna.’`Hard will it be for you to find her,’ replied the Eagle. `Leave with us a silver fork. We will look at it and remember you.’He left a silver fork behind, and went his way. He travelled one day, he travelled two days; at daybreak on the third day he saw a palace grander than the first two, and near the palace stood an oak, and on the oak sat a raven. Down flew the Raven from the oak, smote upon the ground, turned into a brave youth, and cried aloud:`Princess Anna, come forth quickly I our brother is coming.’Out ran the Princess Anna, greeted him joyfully, and began kissing and embracing him, asking after his health and telling him all about herself. Prince Ivan stayed with them three days; then he said:`Farewell! I am going to look for my wife, the fair Princess Marya Morevna.’`Hard will it be for you to find her,’ replied the Raven. `Anyhow, leave your silver snuff-box with us. We will look at it and remember you.’The Prince handed over his silver snuff-box, took his leave, and went his way. One day he went, another day he went, and on the third day he came to where Marya Morevna was. She caught sight of her love, flung her arms around his neck, burst into tears, and exclaimed:`Oh, Prince Ivan! why did you disobey me and go looking into the closet and letting out Koshchei the Deathless?’`Forgive me, Marya Morevna! Remember not the past; much better fly with me while Koshchei the Deathless is out of sight. Perhaps he won’t catch us.’So they got ready and fled. Now Koshchei was out hunting. Towards evening he was returning home, when his good steed stumbled beneath him.`Why stumblest thou, sorry jade? Scentest thou some ill?’ The steed replied:`Prince Ivan has come and carried off Marya Morevna.’ `Is it possible to catch them?’`It is possible to sow wheat, to wait till it grows up, to reap it and thresh it, to grind it to flour, to make five pies of it, to eat those pies, and then to start in pursuit–and even then to be in time.’ Koshchei galloped off and caught up Prince Ivan.`Now,’ says he, `this time I will forgive you, in return for your kindness in giving me water to drink. And a second time I will forgive you; but the third time beware! I will cut you to bits.’Then he took Marya Morevna from him, and carried her off. But Prince Ivan sat down on a stone and burst into tears. He wept and wept–and then returned back again to Marya Morevna. Now Koshchei the Deathless happened not to be at home.`Let us fly, Marya Morevna!’`Ah, Prince Ivan! he will catch us.’`Suppose he does catch us. At all events we shall have spent an hour or two together.’So they got ready and fled. As Koshchei the Deathless was returning home, his good steed stumbled beneath him.`Why stumblest thou, sorry jade? Scentest thou some ill?’`Prince Ivan has come and carried off Marya Morevna.’`Is it possible to catch them?’`It is possible to sow barley, to wait till it grows up, to reap it and thresh it, to brew beer, to drink ourselves drunk on it, to sleep our fill, and then to set off in pursuit–and yet to be in time.’Koshchei galloped off, caught up Prince Ivan:`Didn’t I tell you that you should not see Marya Morevna any more than your own ears?’And he took her away and carried her off home with him.Prince Ivan was left there alone. He wept and wept; then he went back again after Marya Morevna. Koshchei happened to be away from home at that moment.`Let us fly, Marya Morevna!’`Ah, Prince Ivan! he is sure to catch us and hew you in pieces.’`Let him hew away! I cannot live without you.So they got ready and fled.Koshchei the Deathless was returning home when his good steed stumbled beneath him.`Why stumblest thou? Scentest thou any ill?’`Prince Ivan has come and has carried off Marya Morevna.’Koshchei galloped off, caught Prince Ivan, chopped him into little pieces, put them into a barrel, smeared it with pitch and bound it with iron hoops, and flung it into the blue sea. But Marya Morevna he carried off home.At that very time the silver articles turned black which Prince Ivan had left with his brothers-in-law.`Ah!’ said they, `the evil is accomplished sure enough!’Then the Eagle hurried to the blue sea, caught hold of the barrel, and dragged it ashore; the Falcon flew away for the Water of Life, and the Raven for the Water of Death.Afterwards they all three met, broke open the barrel, took out the remains of Prince Ivan, washed them, and put them together in fitting order. The Raven sprinkled them with the Water of Death–the pieces joined together, the body became whole. The Falcon sprinkled it with the Water of Life–Prince Ivan shuddered, stood up, and said:`Ah! what a time I’ve been sleeping!’`You’d have gone on sleeping a good deal longer if it hadn’t been for us,’ replied his brothers-in-law. `Now come and pay us a visit.’`Not so, brothers; I shall go and look for Marya Morevna.’And when he had found her, he said to her:`Find out from Koshchei the Deathless whence he got so good a steed.’So Marya Morevna chose a favourable moment, and began asking Koshchei about it. Koshchei replied:`Beyond thrice nine lands, in the thirtieth kingdom, on the other side of the fiery river, there lives a Baba Yaga. She has so good a mare that she flies right round the world on it every day. And she has many other splendid mares. I watched her herds for three days without losing a single mare, and in return for that the Baba Yaga gave me a foal.’`But how did you get across the fiery river?’`Why, I’ve a handkerchief of this kind–when I wave it thrice on the right hand, there springs up a very lofty bridge, and the fire cannot reach it.’Marya Morevna listened to all this, and repeated it to Prince Ivan, and she carried off the handkerchief and gave it to him. So he managed to get across the fiery river, and then went on to the Baba Yaga’s. Long went he on without getting anything either to eat or to drink. At last he came across an outlandish bird and its young ones. Says Prince Ivan:`I’ll eat one of these chickens.’`Don’t eat it, Prince Ivan!’ begs the outlandish bird; `some time or other I’ll do you a good turn.’He went on farther and saw a hive of bees in the forest.`I’ll get a bit of honeycomb,’ says he.`Don’t disturb my honey, Prince Ivan!’ exclaims the queen- bee; `some time or other I’ll do you a good turn.’So he didn’t disturb it, but went on. Presently there met him a lioness with her cub.`Anyhow, I’ll eat this lion cub,’ says he; `I’m so hungry I feel quite unwell!’`Please let us alone, Prince Ivan!’ begs the lioness; `some time or other I’ll do you a good turn.’`Very well; have it your own way,’ says he.Hungry and faint he wandered on, walked farther and farther, and at last came to where stood the house of the Baba Yaga. Round the house were set twelve poles in a circle, and on each of eleven of these poles was stuck a human head; the twelfth alone remained unoccupied.`Hail, granny!’`Hail, Prince Ivan! wherefore have yon come? Is it of your own accord, or on compulsion?’`I have come to earn from you an heroic steed.’`So be it, Prince! You won’t have to serve a year with me, but just three days. If you take good care of my mares, I’ll give you an heroic steed. But if you don’t–why, then you mustn’t be annoyed at finding your head stuck on top of the last pole up there.’Prince Ivan agreed to these terms. The Baba Yaga gave him food and drink, and bade him set about his business. But the moment he had driven the mares afield, they cocked up their tails, and away they tore across the meadows in all directions. Before the Prince had time to look round they were all out of sight. Thereupon he began to weep and to disquiet himself, and then he sat down upon a stone and went to sleep. But when the sun was near its setting the outlandish bird came flying up to him, and awakened him, saying:`Arise, Prince Ivan! The mares are at home now.’The Prince arose and returned home. There the Baba Yaga was storming and raging at her mares, and shrieking:`Whatever did ye come home for?’`How could we help coming home?’ said they. `There came flying birds from every part of the world, and all but pecked our eyes out.’`Well, well! to-morrow don’t go galloping over the meadows, but disperse amid the thick forests.’Prince Ivan slept all night. In the morning the Baba Yaga says to him:`Mind, Prince! if you don’t take good care of the mares, if you lose merely one of them–your bold head will be stuck on that pole!’He drove the mares afield. Immediately they cocked up their tails and dispersed among the thick forests. Again did the Prince sit down on the stone, weep and weep, and then go to sleep. The sun went down behind the forest. Up came running the lioness.`Arise, Prince Ivan! The mares are all collected.’Prince Ivan arose and went home. More than ever did the Baba Yaga storm at her mares and shriek:`Whatever did ye come back home for?’`How could we help coming back? Beasts of prey came running at us from all parts of the world, and all but tore us utterly to pieces.’`Well, to-morrow run off into the blue sea.’Again did Prince Ivan sleep through the night. Next morning the Baba Yaga sent him forth to watch the mares.`If you don’t take good care of them,’ says she, `your bold head will be stuck on that pole!’He drove the mares afield. Immediately they cocked up their tails, disappeared from sight, and fled into the blue sea. There they stood, up to their necks in water. Prince Ivan sat down on the stone, wept, and fell asleep. But when the sun had set behind the forest, up came flying a bee, and said:`Arise, Prince! The mares are all collected. But when you get home, don’t let the Baba Yaga set eyes on you, but go into the stable and hide behind the mangers. There you will find a sorry colt rolling in the muck. Do you steal it, and at the dead of night ride away from the house.’Prince Ivan arose, slipped into the stable, and lay down behind the mangers, while the Baba Yaga was storming away at her mares and shrieking:`Why did ye come back?’`How could we help coming back? There came flying bees in countless numbers from all parts of the world, and began stinging us on all sides till the blood came!’The Baba Yaga went to sleep. In the dead of the night Prince Ivan stole the sorry colt, saddled it, jumped on its back, and galloped away to the fiery river. When he came to that river he waved the handkerchief three times on the right hand, and suddenly, springing goodness knows whence, there hung across the river, high in the air, a splendid bridge. The Prince rode across the bridge and waved the handkerchief twice only on the left hand; there remained across the river a thin, ever so thin a bridge!When the Baba Yaga got up in the morning the sorry colt was not to be seen! Off she set in pursuit. At full speed did she fly in her iron mortar, urging it on with the pestle, sweeping away her traces with the broom. She dashed up to the fiery river, gave a glance, and said, `A capital bridge!’ She drove on to the bridge, but had only got half-way when the bridge broke in two, and the Baba Yaga went flop into the river. There truly did she meet with a cruel death!Prince Ivan fattened up the colt in the green meadows, and it turned into a wondrous steed. Then he rode to where Marya Morevna was. She came running out, and flung herself on his neck, crying:`By what means has God brought you back to life?’`Thus and thus,’ says he. `Now come along with me.’`I am afraid, Prince Ivan! If Koshchei catches us you will be cut in pieces again.’`No, he won’t catch us! I have a splendid heroic steed now; it flies just like a bird.’ So they got on its back and rode away.Koshchei the Deathless was returning home when his horse stumbled beneath him.`What art thou stumbling for, sorry jade? Dost thou scent any ill?’`Prince Ivan has come and carried off Marya Morevna.’`Can we catch them?’`God knows! Prince Ivan has a horse now which is better than I.’`Well, I can’t stand it,’ says Koshchei the Deathless. `I will pursue.’After a time he came up with Prince Ivan, lighted on the ground, and was going to chop him up with his sharp sword. But at that moment Prince Ivan’s horse smote Koshchei the Deathless full swing with its hoof, and cracked his skull, and the Prince made an end of him with a club. Afterwards the Prince heaped up a pile of wood, set fire to it, burnt Koshchei the Deathless on the pyre, and scattered his ashes to the wind. Then Marya Morevna mounted Koshchei’s horse and Prince Ivan got on his own, and they rode away to visit first the Raven, and then the Eagle, and then the Falcon. Wherever they went they met with a joyful greeting.`Ah, Prince Ivan! why, we never expected to see you again. Well, it wasn’t for nothing that you gave yourself so much trouble. Such a beauty as Marya Morevna one might search for all the world over–and never find one like her!’And so they visited, and they feasted; and afterwards they went off to their own realm.","['make',

1362,slavic,The Abode of the Gods - 2. Time and the King of the Elements,"There was once a married pair who loved each other tenderly. The husband would not have given up his wife for all the riches in the world, while her first thought was how best to please him. So they were very happy, and lived like two grains in one ear of corn.One day while working in the fields, a great longing came over him to see her: so without waiting for the hour of sunset he ran home. Alas! she was not there. He looked high and low, he ran here, there, and everywhere, he wept, he called to her; in vain! his dear wife was not to be found.So heartbroken was he that he no longer cared to live. He could think of nothing but the loss of his dear wife and how to find her again. At last he determined to travel all over the world in search of her. So he began to walk straight on, trusting God to direct his steps. Sad and thoughtful, he wandered for many days, until he reached a cottage close by the shores of a large lake. Here he stopped, hoping to find out news. On entering the cottage he was met by a woman, who tried to prevent him entering.“What do you want here, unlucky wretch?” said she. “If my husband sees you, he will kill you instantly.”“Who is your husband then?” asked the traveller.“What! you do not know him? My husband is the Water-King; everything under water obeys him. Depart quickly, for if he finds you here he will certainly devour you.”“Perhaps after all he would take pity on me. But hide me somewhere, for I am worn and weary, and without shelter for the night.”So the Water-Queen was persuaded, and hid him behind the stove. Almost immediately after the Water-King entered. He had barely crossed the threshold when he called out, “Wife, I smell human flesh; give it me quickly, for I am hungry.” She dared not disobey him, and so she had to tell him of the traveller’s hiding-place. The poor man became terribly frightened, and trembled in every limb, and began to stammer out excuses.“I assure you I have done no harm. I came here in search of news of my poor wife. Oh, do help me to find her; I cannot live without her.”“Well,” replied the Water-King, “as you love your wife so tenderly I will forgive you for coming here, but I cannot help you to find her, for I do not know where she is. Yet I remember seeing two ducks on the lake yesterday, perchance she is one of them. But I should advise you to ask my brother the Fire-King; he may be able to tell you more.”Happy to have escaped so easily, he thanked the Water-King and set out to find the Fire-King. But the latter was unable to help him, and could only advise him to consult his other brother, the Air-King. But the Air-King, though he had travelled all over the earth, could only say he thought he had seen a woman at the foot of the Crystal Mountain.But the traveller was cheered at the news, and went to seek his wife at the foot of the Crystal Mountain, which was close to their cottage. On reaching it he began at once to climb the mountain by making his way up the bed of the torrent that came rushing down there. Several ducks that were in the pools near the waterfall called out, “My good man, don’t go up there; you’ll be killed.”But he walked fearlessly on till he came to some thatched cottages, at the largest of which he stopped. Here a crowd of wizards and witches surrounded him, screaming at the top of their voices, “What are you looking for?”“My wife,” said he.“She is here,” they cried, “but you cannot take her away unless you recognise her among two hundred women all exactly like her.”“What! Not know my own wife? Why, here she is,” said he, as he clasped her in his arms. And she, delighted to be with him again, kissed him fondly. Then she whispered:“Dearest, though you knew me to-day I doubt whether you will to-morrow, for there will be so many of us all alike. Now I will tell you what to do. At nightfall go to the top of the Crystal Mountain, where live the King of Time and his court. Ask him how you may know me. If you are good and honest he will help you; if not, he will devour you whole at one mouthful.”“I will do what you advise, dear one,” he replied, “but tell me, why did you leave me so suddenly? If you only knew what I have suffered! I have sought you all over the world.”“I did not leave you willingly,” said she. “A countryman asked me to come and look at the mountain torrent. When we got there he sprinkled some water over himself, and at once I saw wings growing out of his shoulders, and he soon changed his shape entirely into that of a drake; and I too became a duck at the same time, and whether I would or no I was obliged to follow him. Here I was allowed to resume my own form; and now there is but the one difficulty of being recognised by you.”So they parted, she to join the other women, he to continue his way to the Crystal Mountain. At the top he found twelve strange beings sitting round a large fire: they were the attendants of the King of Time. He saluted them respectfully.“What dost thou want?” said they.“I have lost my dear wife. Can you tell me how to recognise her among two hundred other women all exactly alike?”“No,” said they, “but perhaps our King can.”Then arose from the midst of the flames an old man with bald head and long white beard, who, on hearing his request, replied: “Though all these women be exactly alike, thy wife will have a black thread in the shoe of her right foot.”So saying he vanished, and the traveller, thanking the twelve, descended the mountain.Sure it is that without the black thread he would never have recognised her. And though the Magician tried to hide her, the spell was broken; and the two returned rejoicing to their home, where they lived happily ever after.","['traveller', 'start', 'journey', 'stretch', 'door', 'come', 'yawn', 'hurry', 'ready', 'mean', 'merely', 'tail', 'quietly', 'ready', 'master', 'wait']","['married', 'pair', 'love', 'tenderly', 'husband', 'would', 'give', 'wife', 'rich', 'world', 'first', 'thought', 'best', 'please', 'happy', 'live', 'like', 'grain_corn', 'work', 'field', 'great', 'longing', 'come', 'without', 'wait', 'hour', 'sunset', 'home', 'look', 'high', 'everywhere', 'wept', 'call', 'vain', 'dear', 'wife', 'found', 'heartbroken', 'longer', 'care', 'live', 'could', 'think', 'nothing', 'loss', 'dear', 'wife', 'find', 'last', 'determine', 'travel', 'world', 'search', 'begin', 'walk', 'straight', 'trust', 'direct', 'step', 'thoughtful', 'wander', 'many', 'reach', 'cottage', 'close', 'shore', 'large', 'lake', 'stop', 'find', 'news', 'enter', 'cottage', 'woman', 'prevent', 'enter', 'want', 'unlucky', 'wretch', 'husband', 'kill', 'instantly', 'husband', 'traveller', 'know', 'husband', 'water-king', 'everything', 'water', 'obeys', 'depart', 'quickly', 'find', 'certainly', 'devour', 'perhaps', 'would', 'take', 'pity', 'hide', 'somewhere', 'worn', 'weary', 'without', 'shelter_night', 'water-queen', 'persuade', 'behind_stove', 'almost', 'immediately', 'water-king', 'enter', 'barely', 'cross_threshold', 'call', 'wife', 'smell_human', 'flesh', 'give', 'quickly', 'hungry', 'dare_disobey', 'tell', 'traveller', 'hiding-place', 'poor', 'become', 'terribly_frighten', 'tremble', 'every', 'limb', 'begin', 'stammer', 'excuse', 'assure', 'harm', 'come', 'search', 'news', 'poor', 'wife', 'help', 'find', 'live', 'without', 'well', 'reply', 'water-king', 'love', 'wife', 'tenderly', 'forgive', 'come', 'help', 'find', 'know', 'remember', 'duck', 'lake', 'yesterday', 'perchance', 'advise', 'brother', 'fire-king', 'able', 'tell', 'happy', 'escape', 'easily', 'thanked', 'water-king', 'find', 'fire-king', 'latter', 'unable', 'help', 'could', 'advise', 'consult', 'brother', 'air-king', 'air-king', 'though', 'travel', 'earth', 'could', 'thought', 'woman', 'foot', 'crystal', 'mountain', 'traveller', 'cheer', 'news', 'seek', 'wife', 'foot', 'crystal', 'mountain', 'close', 'cottage', 'reach', 'begin', 'climb', 'mountain', 'make', 'torrent', 'come', 'rush', 'several', 'duck', 'pool', 'near', 'waterfall', 'call', 'good', 'kill', 'walk', 'fearlessly', 'till', 'come', 'thatch', 'cottage', 'large', 'stop', 'crowd', 'wizard', 'witch', 'surround', 'scream', 'voice', 'look', 'wife', 'take', 'away', 'unless', 'recognise', 'among', 'hundred', 'woman', 'exactly_like', 'know', 'wife', 'clasped', 'delighted', 'kiss', 'fondly', 'whisper', 'dearest', 'though', 'knew', 'to-day', 'doubt_whether', 'to-morrow', 'many', 'alike', 'tell', 'nightfall', 'crystal', 'mountain', 'live', 'king', 'time', 'court', 'know', 'good', 'honest', 'help', 'devour', 'whole', 'mouthful', 'advise', 'dear', 'reply', 'tell', 'leave', 'suddenly', 'knew', 'suffer', 'sought', 'world', 'leave', 'willingly', 'countryman', 'come', 'look', 'mountain', 'torrent', 'sprinkle_water', 'wing', 'grow', 'shoulder', 'soon', 'change_shape', 'entirely', 'drake', 'become', 'duck', 'time', 'whether', 'would', 'oblige', 'follow', 'allow', 'resume', 'form', 'difficulty', 'recognise', 'part', 'join', 'woman', 'continue', 'crystal', 'mountain', 'found', 'twelve', 'strange', 'being', 'round', 'large', 'fire', 'attendant', 'king', 'time', 'salute', 'respectfully', 'dost_thou', 'want', 'lose', 'dear', 'wife', 'tell', 'recognise', 'among', 'hundred', 'woman', 'exactly_alike', 'perhaps', 'king', 'arose', 'midst', 'flame', 'bald_head', 'long', 'white_beard', 'hearing', 'request', 'reply', 'though', 'woman', 'exactly_alike', 'wife', 'black', 'thread', 'shoe', 'right', 'foot', 'vanished', 'traveller', 'thank', 'twelve', 'descend', 'mountain', 'sure', 'without', 'black', 'thread', 'would', 'never', 'recognise', 'though', 'magician', 'hide', 'spell_broken', 'return', 'rejoice', 'home', 'live_happily', 'ever']",slavic,sid1362
1443,slavic,The Pigeon's Bride - The Story of a Princess Who Kissed and Told,"There was once a King who had an only daughter. She was as lovely as a princess ought to be and by the time she reached a marriageable age the fame of her beauty had spread far and wide over all the world. Neighboring kings and even distant ones were already sending envoys to her father’s court begging permission to offer their sons as suitors to the Princess’s hand. As he had no son of his own the Princess’s father was delighted that the day was fast approaching when he might have a son-in-law, and long before even the name of any particular prince was discussed the Princess’s mother had planned the wedding down to its last detail.The Princess alone was uninterested.“I’m not ready to get married yet,” she’d say to her parents every day when they’d begin telling her about the various princes who were anxious to gain her favor. “Why such haste? I’m young and there’s plenty of time. Besides, just now I’m too busy with my embroidery to be bothered with a crowd of young men.”With that, before the King could reprove her, the Princess would throw her arms about his neck, kiss him under the corner of his mustache, and go flying off to the tower-room where she had her embroidery frame.Her mother, the Queen, was much upset by the Princess’s attitude.“In my youth,” she said, “girls were not like this. We were brought up to think that courtship and marriage were the most important events in our lives. I don’t know what’s getting into the heads of the young girls nowadays!”But the King, who was still smiling from the tickling little kiss which the Princess had planted under the corner of his mustache, always answered:“Tut! Tut! We needn’t worry yet! Take my word for it when some particular young man comes along she’ll be interested fast enough!”At this the Queen, ending the discussion every day with the same words, would shake her head and declare:“I tell you it isn’t natural for a girl to be more interested in embroidery than in a long line of handsome young suitors!”The Princess was interested in her embroidery—there’s no doubt about that. She spent every moment she could in the tower-room, working and singing. The tower was high up among the treetops. It was reached by winding stairs so narrow and so many that no one any older than the Princess would care to climb them. The Princess flew up them like a bird, scarcely pausing for breath. At the top of the stairs was a trap-door which was the only means of entrance into the tower-room. Once in the tower-room with the bolt of the trap-door securely fastened, the Princess was safe from interruption and could work away at her embroidery to her heart’s content. The tower had windows on all sides, so the Princess as she sat at her embroidery frame could look out north, east, south, and west.The clouds sailed by in the sky, the wind blew and at once the leaves in the treetops began murmuring and whispering among themselves, and the birds that went flying all over the world would often alight on some branch near the tower and sing to the Princess as she worked or chatter some exciting story that she could almost understand.“What!” the Princess would think to herself as she looked out north, east, south, and west. “Leave my tower and my beautiful embroidery to become the wife of some conceited young man! Never!”From this remark you can understand perfectly well that the particular young man of whom her father spoke had not yet come along. And I’m sure you’ll also know that shutting herself up in the tower-room and bolting the trap-door was not going to keep him away when it was time for him to come. Yet I don’t believe that you’d have recognized him when he did come any more than the Princess did. This is how it happened:One afternoon when as usual she was working at her embroidery and singing as she worked, suddenly there was a flutter of wings at the eastern window and a lovely Pigeon came flying into the room. It circled three times about the Princess’s head and then alighted on the embroidery frame. The Princess reached out her hand and the bird, instead of taking fright, allowed her to stroke its gleaming neck. Then she took it gently in her hands and fondled it to her bosom, kissing its bill and smoothing its plumage with her lips.“You beautiful thing!” she cried. “How I love you!”“If you really love me,” the Pigeon said, “have a bowl of milk here at this same hour to-morrow and then we’ll see what we’ll see.”With that the bird spread its wings and flew out the western window.The Princess was so excited that for the rest of the afternoon she forgot her embroidery.“Did the Pigeon really speak?” she asked herself as she stood staring out the western window, “or have I been dreaming?”The next day when she climbed the winding stairs she went slowly for she carried in her hands a brimming bowl of milk.“Of course it won’t come again!” she said, and she made herself sit down quietly before the embroidery frame and work just as though she expected nothing.But exactly at the same hour as the day before there was a flutter of wings at the eastern window, the sound of a gentle coo! coo! and there was the Pigeon ready to be loved and caressed.“You beautiful creature!” the Princess cried, kissing its coral beak and smoothing its neck with her lips, “how I love you! And see, I have brought you the bowl of milk that you asked for!”The bird flew over to the bowl, poised for a moment on its brim, then splashed into the milk as though to take a bath.The Princess laughed and clapped her hands and then, as she looked, she saw a strange thing happen. The bird’s feathers opened like a shirt and out of the feather shirt stepped a handsome youth.(You remember I told you how surprised the Princess was going to be. And you’re surprised, too, aren’t you?)He was so handsome that all the Princess could say was, “Oh!”He came slowly towards her and knelt before her.“Dear Princess,” he said, “do not be frightened. If it had not been for your sweet words yesterday when you said you loved me I should never have been able to leave this feather shirt. Do not turn from me now because I am a man and not a pigeon. Love me still if you can, for I love you. It was because I fell in love with you yesterday when I saw you working at your embroidery that I flew in by the open window and let you caress me.”For a long time the Princess could only stare at the kneeling youth, too amazed to speak. He was so handsome that she forgot all about the pigeon he used to be, she forgot her embroidery, she forgot everything. She hadn’t supposed that any young man in the whole world could be so handsome! Why, just looking at him, she could be happy forever and ever and ever!“Would you rather I were still a pigeon?” the young man asked.“No! No! No!” the Princess cried. “I like you ever so much better this way!”The young man gravely bowed his head and kissed her hand and the Princess blushed and trembled and wished he would do it again. She had never imagined that any kiss could be so wonderful!They passed the afternoon together and it seemed to the Princess it was the happiest afternoon of all her life. As the sun was sinking the youth said:“Now I must leave you and become a pigeon again.”“But you’ll come back, won’t you?” the Princess begged.“Yes, I’ll come back to-morrow but on one condition: that you don’t tell any one about me. I’ll come back every day at the same hour but if ever you tell about me then I won’t be able to come back any more.”“I’ll never tell!” the Princess promised.Then the youth kissed her tenderly, dipped himself in the milk, went back into his feather shirt, and flew off as a pigeon.The next day he came again and the next and the next and the Princess fell so madly in love with him that all day long and all night long, too, she thought of nothing else. She no longer touched her embroidery but day after day sat idle in the tower-room just awaiting the hour of his arrival. And every day it seemed to the King and the Queen and all the people about the Court that the Princess was becoming more and more beautiful. Her cheeks kept growing pinker, her eyes brighter, her lovely hair more golden.“I must say sitting at that foolish embroidery agrees with her,” the King said.“No, it isn’t that,” the Queen told him. “It’s the big bowl of milk she drinks every afternoon. You know milk is very good for the complexion.”“Milk indeed!” murmured the Princess to herself, and she blushed rosier than ever at thought of her wonderful secret.But a princess can’t keep growing more and more beautiful without everybody in the world hearing about it. The neighboring kings soon began to feel angry and suspicious.“What ails this Princess?” they asked among themselves. “Isn’t one of our sons good enough for her? Is she waiting for the King of Persia to come as a suitor or what? Let us stand together on our rights and demand to know why she won’t consider one of our sons!”So they sent envoys to the Princess’s father and he saw at once that the matter had become serious.“My dear,” he said to the Princess, “your mother and I have humored you long enough. It is high time that you had a husband and I insist that you allow the sons of neighboring kings to be presented to you next week.”“I won’t do it!” the Princess declared. “I’m not interested in the sons of the neighboring kings and that’s all there is about it!”Her father looked at her severely.“Is that the way for a princess to talk? Persist in this foolishness and you may embroil your country in war!”“I don’t care!” the Princess cried, bursting into tears. “I can’t marry any of them, so why let them be presented?”“Why can’t you marry any of them?”“I just can’t!” the Princess insisted.At first, in spite of the pleadings of both parents, she would tell them no more, but her mother kept questioning her until at last in self-defense the Princess confessed that she had a true love who came to her in the tower every afternoon in the form of a pigeon.“He’s a prince,” she told them, “the son of a distant king. At present he is under an enchantment that turns him into a pigeon. When the enchantment is broken he is coming as a prince to marry me.”“My poor child!” the Queen cried. “Think no more about this Pigeon Prince! The enchantment may last a hundred years and then where will you be!”“But he is my love!” the Princess declared, “and if I can’t have him I won’t have any one!”When the King found that nothing they could say would move her from this resolution, he sighed and murmured:“Very well, my dear. If it must be so, it must be. This afternoon when your lover comes, bring him down to me that I may talk to him.”But that afternoon the Pigeon did not come. Nor the next afternoon either, nor the next, and then too late the Princess remembered his warning that if she told about him he could never come back.So now she sat in the tower-room idle and heartbroken, reproaching herself that she had betrayed her lover and praying God to forgive her and send him back to her. And the roses faded from her cheeks and her eyes grew dull and the people about the Court began wondering why they had ever thought her the most beautiful princess in the world.At last she went to the King, her father, and said:“As my love can no longer come back to me because I forgot my promise and betrayed him, I must go out into the world and hunt him. Unless I find him life will not be worth the living. So do not oppose me, father, but help me. Have three pairs of iron shoes made for me and three iron staffs. I will wander over the wide world until these are worn out and then, if by that time I have not found him, I will come home to you.”So the King had three pairs of iron shoes made for the Princess and three iron staffs and she set forth on her quest. She traveled through towns and cities and many kingdoms, over rough mountains and desert places, looking everywhere for her enchanted love. But nowhere could she find any trace of him.At the end of the first year she had worn out the first pair of iron shoes and the first iron staff. At the end of the second year she had worn out the second pair of iron shoes and the second iron staff. At the end of the third year, when she had worn out the third pair of iron shoes and the third staff, she returned to her father’s palace looking thin and worn and sad.“My poor child,” the King said, “I hope now you realize that the Pigeon Prince is gone forever. Think no more about him. Go back to your embroidery and when the roses begin blooming in your cheeks again we’ll find some young prince for you who isn’t enchanted.”But the Princess shook her head.“Let me try one thing more, father,” she begged, “and then if I don’t find my love I’ll do as you say.”The King agreed to this.“Well, then,” the Princess said, “build a public bath-house and have the heralds proclaim that the King’s daughter will sit at the entrance and will allow any one to bathe free of charge who will tell her the story of the strangest thing he has ever heard or seen.”So the King built the bath-house and sent out his heralds far and wide. Men and women from all over the world came and bathed and told the Princess stories of this marvel and that, but never, alas, a word of an enchanted pigeon.The days went by and the Princess grew more and more discouraged.“Isn’t it sad,” the courtiers began whispering, “how the Princess has lost her looks! Do you suppose she ever was really beautiful or did we just imagine it?”And the neighboring kings when they heard this remarked softly among themselves:“It’s just as well we didn’t hurry one of our sons into a marriage with this young woman!”Now there was a poor widow who lived near the bath-house. She had a daughter, a pretty young girl, who used to sit at the window and watch the Princess as people came and told her their stories.“Mother,” the girl said one day, “every one in the world goes to the bath-house and I want to go, too!”“Nonsense!” the mother said. “What story could you tell the Princess?”“But everybody else goes and I don’t see why I can’t!”“Well, my dear,” the mother promised, “you may just as soon as you see or hear something strange. Talk no more about it now but go, fetch me a pitcher of water from the town well.”The girl obediently took an empty pitcher and went to the town well. Just as she had filled the pitcher she heard some one say:“Mercy me, I fear I’ll be late!”She turned around and what do you think she saw? A rooster in wooden shoes with a basket under his wing!“I fear I’ll be late! I fear I’ll be late!” the rooster kept repeating as he hurried off making a funny little clatter with his wooden shoes.“How strange!” the girl thought to herself. “A rooster with wooden shoes! I’m sure the Princess would love to hear about him! I’ll follow him and see what he does.”He went to a garden where he filled his basket with fresh vegetables—with onions and beans and garlic. Then he hurried home to a little house. The girl slipped in after him and hid behind the door.“Thank goodness, I’m on time!” the rooster murmured.He put a big bowl on the table and filled it with milk.“There!” he said. “Now I’m ready for them!”Presently twelve beautiful pigeons came flying in by the open door. Eleven of them dipped in the bowl of milk, their feather shirts opened, and out they stepped eleven handsome youths. But the Twelfth Pigeon perched disconsolately on the windowsill and remained a pigeon. The eleven laughed at him and said:“Poor fellow, your bride betrayed you, didn’t she? So you have to remain shut up in your feather shirt while we go off and have a jolly time!”“Yes,” the Twelfth Pigeon said, “she broke her promise and now she goes wandering up and down the world hunting for me. If she doesn’t find me I shall nevermore escape the feather shirt but shall have to fly about forever as a pigeon. But I know she will find me for she will never stop until she does. And when she finds me, then the enchantment will be broken forever and I can marry her!”The eleven youths went laughing arm in arm out of the house and in a few moments the solitary Pigeon flew after them. Instantly the girl slipped out from behind the door and hurried home with her pitcher of water. Then she ran quickly across to the bath-house and all out of breath she cried to the Princess:“O Princess, I have such a wonderful story to tell you all about a rooster with wooden shoes and twelve pigeons only eleven of them are not pigeons but handsome young men and the twelfth one has to stay in his feather shirt because—”At mention of the enchanted pigeons, the Princess turned pale. She held up her hand and made the girl pause until she had her breath, then she questioned her until she knew the whole story.“It must be my love!” the Princess thought to herself. “Thank God I have found him at last!”The next day at the same hour she went with the girl to the town well and when the rooster clattered by in his wooden shoes they followed him home and slipping into the house they hid behind the door and waited. Presently twelve pigeons flew in. Eleven of them dipped in the milk and came out handsome young men. The Twelfth sat disconsolately on the window sill and remained a pigeon. The eleven laughed at him and twitted him with having had a bride that had betrayed him. Then the eleven went away laughing arm in arm. Before the Twelfth could fly after them, the Princess ran out from behind the door and cried:“My dear one, I have found you at last!”The Pigeon flew into her hands and she took him and kissed his coral beak and smoothed his gleaming plumage with her lips. Then she put him in the milk and the feather shirt opened and her own true love stepped out.She led him at once to her father and when the King found him well trained in all the arts a prince should know he accepted him as his future son-in-law and presented him to the people.So after all the Princess’s mother was able to give her daughter the gorgeous wedding she had planned for years and years. Preparations were begun at once but the Queen insisted on making such vast quantities of little round cakes and candied fruits and sweetmeats of all kinds that it was three whole months before the wedding actually took place. By that time the roses were again blooming in the Princess’s cheeks, her eyes were brighter than before, and her long shining hair was more golden than ever.All the neighboring kings were invited to the wedding and when they saw the bride they shook their heads sadly and said among themselves:“Lost her looks indeed! What did people mean by saying such a thing? Why, she’s the most beautiful princess in the world! What a pity she didn’t marry one of our sons!”But when they met the Prince of her choice, they saw at once why the Princess had fallen in love with him.“Any girl would!” they said.It was a big wedding, as I told you before, and the only guest present who was not a king or a queen or a royal personage of some sort was the poor girl who saw the rooster with wooden shoes in the first place. The Queen, of course, had wanted only royalty but the Princess declared that the poor girl was her dear friend and would have to be invited. So the Queen, when she saw that the Princess was set on having her own way, had the poor girl come to the palace before the wedding and decked her out in rich clothes until people were sure that she was some strange princess whom the bride had met on her travels.“My dear,” whispered the Princess as they sat down beside each other at the wedding feast, “how beautiful you look!”“But I’m not as beautiful as you!” the girl said.The Princess laughed.“Of course not! No one can be as beautiful as I am because I have the secret of beauty!”“Dear Princess,” the poor girl begged, “won’t you tell me the secret of beauty?”The Princess leaned over and whispered something in the poor girl’s ear.It was only one word:“Happiness!”","['story', 'good', 'soul', 'uncle', 'grandmother', 'heaven', 'take', 'glory', 'tell', 'unless', 'spectacle', 'upside', 'fancy', 'give',

1447,slavic,The Enchanted Knife,"Once upon a time there lived a young man who vowed that he would never marry any girl who had not royal blood in her veins. One day he plucked up all his courage and went to the palace to ask the emperor for his daughter. The emperor was not much pleased at the thought of such a match for his only child, but being very polite, he only said:‘Very well, my son, if you can win the princess you shall have her, and the conditions are these. In eight days you must manage to tame and bring to me three horses that have never felt a master. The first is pure white, the second a foxy-red with a black head, the third coal black with a white head and feet. And besides that, you must also bring as a present to the empress, my wife, as much gold as the three horses can carry.’The young man listened in dismay to these words, but with an effort he thanked the emperor for his kindness and left the palace, wondering how he was to fulfil the task allotted to him. Luckily for him, the emperor’s daughter had overheard everything her father had said, and peeping through a curtain had seen the youth, and thought him handsomer than anyone she had ever beheld.So returning hastily to her own room, she wrote him a letter which she gave to a trusty servant to deliver, begging her wooer to come to her rooms early the next day, and to undertake nothing without her advice, if he ever wished her to be his wife.That night, when her father was asleep, she crept softly into his chamber and took out an enchanted knife from the chest where he kept his treasures, and hid it carefully in a safe place before she went to bed.The sun had hardly risen the following morning when the princess’s nurse brought the young man to her apartments. Neither spoke for some minutes, but stood holding each other’s hands for joy, till at last they both cried out that nothing but death should part them. Then the maiden said:‘Take my horse, and ride straight through the wood towards the sunset till you come to a hill with three peaks. When you get there, turn first to the right and then to the left, and you will find yourself in a sun meadow, where many horses are feeding. Out of these you must pick out the three described to you by my father. If they prove shy, and refuse to let you get near them, draw out your knife, and let the sun shine on it so that the whole meadow is lit up by its rays, and the horses will then approach you of their own accord, and will let you lead them away. When you have them safely, look about till you see a cypress tree, whose roots are of brass, whose boughs are of silver, and whose leaves are of gold. Go to it, and cut away the roots with your knife, and you will come to countless bags of gold. Load the horses with all they can carry, and return to my father, and tell him that you have done your task, and can claim me for your wife.’The princess had finished all she had to say, and now it depended on the young man to do his part. He hid the knife in the folds of his girdle, mounted his horse, and rode off in search of the meadow. This he found without much difficulty, but the horses were all so shy that they galloped away directly he approached them. Then he drew his knife, and held it up towards the sun, and directly there shone such a glory that the whole meadow was bathed in it. From all sides the horses rushed pressing round, and each one that passed him fell on its knees to do him honour.But he only chose from them all the three that the emperor had described. These he secured by a silken rope to his own horse, and then looked about for the cypress tree. It was standing by itself in one corner, and in a moment he was beside it, tearing away the earth with his knife. Deeper and deeper he dug, till far down, below the roots of brass, his knife struck upon the buried treasure, which lay heaped up in bags all around. With a great effort he lifted them from their hiding place, and laid them one by one on his horses’ backs, and when they could carry no more he led them back to the emperor. And when the emperor saw him, he wondered, but never guessed how it was the young man had been too clever for him, till the betrothal ceremony was over. Then he asked his newly made son-in-law what dowry he would require with his bride. To which the bridegroom made answer, ‘Noble emperor! all I desire is that I may have your daughter for my wife, and enjoy for ever the use of your enchanted knife.’","['always', 'giant', 'giant',

1475,slavic,"The Story of the Plentiful Tablecloth, the Avenging Wand, the Sash that Becomes a Lake and the Terrible Helmet","Now it once happened that one of the king’s herdsmen had three sons. Two of these lads were supposed to be very sharp-witted, while the youngest was thought to be very stupid indeed. The elder sons helped their father to look after the flocks and herds, while the fool, so they called him, was good for nothing but sleeping and amusing himself.He would pass whole days and nights slumbering peacefully on the stove, only getting off when forced to by others, or when he was too warm and wished to lie on the other side, or when, hungry and thirsty, he wanted food and drink.His father had no love for him, and called him a ne’er-do-well. His brothers often tormented him by dragging him off the stove, and taking away his food—indeed, he would many a time have gone hungry if his mother had not been good to him and fed him on the quiet. She caressed him fondly, for why should he suffer, thought she, if he does happen to have been born a fool? Besides, who can understand the ways of God? It sometimes happens that the wisest men are not happy, while the foolish, when harmless and gentle, lead contented lives.One day, on their return from the fields, the fool’s two brothers dragged him off the stove, and taking him into the yard, where they gave him a sound thrashing, they turned him out of the house, saying, “Go, fool, and lose no time, for you shall have neither food nor lodging until you bring us a basket of mushrooms from the wood.”The poor lad was so taken by surprise he hardly understood what his brothers wanted him to do. After pondering for a while he made his way towards a small oak forest, where everything seemed to have a strange and marvellous appearance, so strange that he did not recognise the place. As he walked he came to a small dead tree-stump, on the top of which he placed his cap, saying, “Every tree here raises its head to the skies and wears a good cap of leaves, but you, my poor friend, are bare-headed; you will die of cold. You must be among your brothers, as I am among mine—a born fool. Take then my cap.” And, throwing his arms round the dead stump, he wept and embraced it tenderly. At that moment an oak which stood near began to walk towards him as if it were alive. The poor fellow was frightened, and about to run away, but the oak spake like a human being and said, “Do not fly; stop a moment and listen to me. This withered tree is my son, and up to this time no one has grieved for his dead youth but me. You have now watered him with your tears, and in return for your sympathy you shall henceforward have anything you ask of me, on pronouncing these words:“‘O Oak Tree so green, and with acorns of gold,Your friendship to prove I will try;In Heaven’s good name now to beg I’ll make bold,My needs, then, oh kindly supply.’”At the same moment a shower of golden acorns fell. The fool filled his pockets, thanked the oak, and bowing to her returned home.“Well, stupid, where are the mushrooms?” cried one of his brothers.“I have some mushrooms off the oak in my pockets.”“Eat them yourself then, for you will get nothing else, you good-for-nothing. What have you done with your cap?”“I put it on a poor stump of a tree that stood by the wayside, for its head was uncovered, and I was afraid it might freeze.”He then scrambled on to the top of the stove, and as he lay down some of the golden acorns fell out of his pocket. So bright were they, they shone like sunbeams in the room. In spite of the fool’s entreaties the brothers picked them up and gave them to their father, who hastened to present them to the king, telling him that his idiot son had gathered them in the wood. The king immediately sent a detachment of his guards to the forest to find the oak which bore golden acorns. But their efforts were fruitless, for, though they hunted in every nook and corner of the forest, they found not a single oak that bore acorns of gold.At first the king was very angry, but when he grew calmer he sent for his herdsman and said to him, “Tell your son, the fool, that he must bring me, by this evening, a cask filled to the brim with these precious golden acorns. If he obeys my commands you shall never lack bread and salt, and you may rest assured that my royal favour will not fail you in time of need.”The herdsman gave his youngest son the king’s message.“The king, I see,” he replied, “is fond of a good bargain; he does not ask, he commands—and insists upon a fool fetching him acorns of solid gold in return for promises made of air. No, I shall not go.”And neither prayers nor threats were of the slightest avail to make him change his mind. At last his brothers pulled him forcibly off the stove, put his coat on him and a new cap, and dragged him into the yard, where they gave him a good beating and drove him away, saying, “Now, you stupid, lose no time; be off, and be quick. If you return without the golden acorns you shall have neither supper nor bed.”What was the poor fellow to do? For a long time he wept, then crossing himself he went in the direction of the forest. He soon reached the dead stump, upon which his cap still rested, and going up to the mother oak, said to her:“O Oak Tree so green, and with acorns of gold,In my helplessness I to thee cry;In Heaven’s great name now to beg I make bold,My pressing needs pray satisfy.”The oak moved, and shook its branches: but instead of golden acorns, a tablecloth fell into the fool’s hands. And the tree said, “Keep this cloth always in your possession, and for your own use. When you want a benefit by it, you need only say:“‘O Tablecloth, who for the poor,The hungry, and thirsty, makes cheer,May he who begs from door to doorFeed off you without stint or fear.’”When it had uttered these words the oak ceased to speak, and the fool, thanking her, bowed, and turned towards home. On his way he wondered to himself how he should tell his brothers, and what they would say, but above all he thought how his good mother would rejoice to see the feast-giving tablecloth. When he had walked about half the distance he met an old beggar who said to him, “See what a sick and ragged old man I am: for the love of God give me a little money or some bread.”The fool spread his tablecloth on the grass, and inviting the beggar to sit down, said:“O Tablecloth, who for the poor,The hungry, and thirsty, makes cheer,May he who begs from door to doorFeed off you without stint or fear.”Then a whistling was heard in the air, and overhead something shone brightly. At the same instant a table, spread as for a royal banquet, appeared before them. Upon it were many different kinds of food, flasks of mead, and glasses of the choicest wine. The plate was of gold and silver.The fool and the beggar man crossed themselves and began to feast. When they had finished the whistling was again heard, and everything vanished. The fool folded up his tablecloth and went on his way. But the old man said, “If you will give me your tablecloth you shall have this wand in exchange. When you say certain words to it, it will set upon the person or persons pointed out, and give them such a thrashing, that to get rid of it they will give you anything they possess.”The fool thought of his brothers and exchanged the tablecloth for the wand, after which they both went on their respective ways.Suddenly the fool remembered that the oak had ordered him to keep the tablecloth for his own use, and that by parting with it he had lost the power of giving his mother an agreeable surprise. So he said to the wand:“Thou self-propelling, ever willing, fighting Wand,Run quick and bringMy feast-providing tablecloth back to my hand,Thy praise I’ll sing.”The wand went off like an arrow after the old man, quickly overtook him, and throwing itself upon him began to beat him dreadfully, crying out in a loud voice:“For others’ goods you seem to have a liking,Stop, thief, or sure your back I’ll keep on striking.”The poor beggar tried to run away, but it was of no use, for the wand followed him, striking all the time and repeating the same words over and over again. So in spite of his anxiety to keep the tablecloth he was forced to throw it away and flee.The wand brought the cloth back to the fool, who again went on his way towards home, thinking of the surprise in store for his mother and brothers. He had not gone very far when a traveller, carrying an empty wallet, accosted him, saying, “For the love of God, give me a small coin or a morsel of food, for my bag is empty and I am very hungry. I have, too, a long journey before me.”The fool again spread his tablecloth on the grass and said:“O Tablecloth, who for the poor,The hungry, and thirsty, makes cheer,May he who begs from door to doorFeed off you without stint or fear.”A whistling was heard in the air, something shone brightly overhead, and a table, spread as for a royal feast, placed itself before them. It was laid with a numerous variety of dishes, hydromel and costly wines. The fool and his guest sat down, crossed themselves, and ate to their hearts’ content. When they had finished whistling was again heard, and everything vanished. The fool folded the cloth up carefully, and was about to continue his journey when the traveller said, “Will you exchange your tablecloth for my waistband? When you say to it certain words it will turn into a deep lake, upon which you may float at will. The words run thus:“‘O marvellous, wonderful, lake-forming Band,For my safety, and not for my fun,Bear me in a boat on thy waves far from land,So that I from my foes need not run.’”The fool thought his father would find it very convenient always to have water at hand for the king’s flocks, so he gave his tablecloth in exchange for the belt, which he wound round his loins, and taking the wand in his hand, they went off in opposite directions. After a little while the fool began to reflect on what the oak had told him about keeping the tablecloth for his own use, and he remembered, too, that he was depriving himself of the power of giving his mother a pleasant surprise. Thereupon he said the magic words to his wand:“Thou self-propelling, ever willing, fighting Wand,Run quick and bringMy feast-providing tablecloth back to my hand,Thy praise I’ll sing.”The wand at once started in pursuit of the poor traveller, whom it began to beat, at the same time crying out:“For others’ goods you seem to have a liking,Stop, thief, or sure your back I’ll keep on striking.”The man was scared out of his wits, and tried to escape the wand’s blows, but it was of no use, so he was forced to throw the tablecloth away and run at the top of his speed. The wand brought the tablecloth back to his master. The latter hid it under his coat, rearranged the waistband, and taking the faithful wand in his hand, again went towards home. As he walked he rejoiced to think of the pleasure he should have in exercising the wand on his wicked brothers, of his father’s satisfaction when, by the help of the waistband, he could always have water for the king’s flocks, even in the driest weather, and of his mother’s joy on witnessing the wonders of the feast-giving tablecloth. These pleasant thoughts were interrupted by a soldier, lame, clothed in rags, and covered with wounds. He had once been a famous warrior.“I am pursued by misfortunes,” said he to the fool. “I was once a brave soldier, and fought valiantly in my youth. Now I am lamed for life, and on this lonely road have found no one to give me a morsel of food. Have pity on me and give me a little bread.”The fool sat down on the grass, and spreading out his tablecloth, said:“O Tablecloth, who for the poor,The hungry, and thirsty, makes cheer,May he who begs from door to doorFeed off you without stint or fear.”A whistling was heard in the air, something bright shone overhead, and then before them stood a table, spread as for a royal feast, loaded with dainty dishes, mead, and costly wines. When they had eaten and drunk as much as they wanted the whistling was again heard, and then everything vanished.The fool was folding up his tablecloth, when the soldier said:“Will you give me your tablecloth in exchange for this six-horned helmet? It will fire itself off and instantly destroy the object pointed out. You have but to turn it round on your head and repeat these words:“‘O Magic Helmet, never thouDost want for powder nor shot;Allay my fears and fire nowJust where I point. Fail not.’You will see that it fires off immediately: and even if your enemy were a mile away he would fall.”The fool was delighted with the idea, and thought how useful such a hat would be in any sudden danger; it would even serve him to defend his country, the king, or himself. So he handed the tablecloth to the soldier, put the helmet on his head, took his wand in his hand, and again set his face towards home.When he had gone some distance, and the soldier was almost out of sight, he began to think of what the oak had said about not parting with the tablecloth, and of how his dear mother could not now enjoy the pleasant surprise he had been dreaming about. So he said to the wand:“Thou self-propelling, ever willing, fighting Wand,Run quick, and bringMy feast-providing tablecloth back to my hand,Thy praise I’ll sing.”The wand dashed after the soldier, and having reached him began to beat him, crying out:“For others’ goods you seem to have a liking,Stop, thief, or sure your back I’ll keep on striking.”The soldier was still a powerful man, and in spite of his wound turned right about face, intending to give blow for blow. But the wand was too much for him, and he soon found resistance useless. So, overcome by pain rather than fear, he threw away the tablecloth and took to his heels.The faithful wand brought the tablecloth back to his master, who, glad to have it again, once more turned towards home.He soon left the forest, crossed the fields, and came in sight of his father’s house. At a little distance therefrom his brothers met him, and said crossly, “Well, stupid, where are the golden acorns?”The fool looked at them and laughed in their faces. Then he said to his wand:“O self-propelling, ever willing, fighting WandStrike with thy usual fireMy ever-scolding, teasing, worrying brother band,For they have roused my ire.”The wand needed no second bidding, and darting out of his hand began to thrash the brothers soundly, crying out like a reasoning creature:“Your brother has often your blows felt, alack!Now taste it yourselves; hope you like it, whack, whack.”The brothers were overpowered, and felt all the while as if boiling water were being poured over their heads. Yelling with pain they began to run at full speed, and soon disappeared with clouds of dust flying round them.The wand then came back to the fool’s hand. He went into the house, climbed on the stove, and told his mother all that had happened. Then he cried:“O Tablecloth, who for the poor,The hungry, and thirsty, makes cheer,Let us within our cottage doorFeed off you without stint or fear.”A whistling was heard in the air, something bright shone overhead, and then a table, laid as for a royal banquet, was placed before them, covered with dainty meats, glasses, and bottles of mead and wine. The whole service was of gold and silver. As the fool and his mother were about to begin the feast the herdsman entered. He stopped, dumb with amazement, but when invited to partake, began to eat and drink with great enjoyment.At the end of the meal the whistling was again heard, and everything vanished completely.The herdsman set off in hot haste to the court, to tell the king of this new marvel. Thereupon his majesty sent one of his heroes in search of the fool, whom he found stretched on the stove.“If you value your life, listen, and obey the king’s orders,” said the paladin. “He commands you to send him by me your tablecloth, then you shall have your share of his royal favour. But if not you will always remain a poor fool, and will, moreover, be treated as a refractory prisoner. We teach them how to behave; you understand?”“Oh yes, I understand.” And then he pronounced the magic words:“O self-propelling, ever willing, fighting Wand,Go, soundly thrash that man—The most deceiving, dangerous wretch in all the land,So hurt him all you can.”The wand sprang from the fool’s hand with the speed of lightning and struck the paladin three times in the face. He immediately fled, but the wand was after him, hitting him all the time, and crying out:“Mere promises are children’s play,So do not throw your breath away,But think of something true to say,You rogue, when next you come our way.”Defeated and filled with consternation, the paladin returned to the king and told him about the wand, and how badly he had been beaten. When the king heard that the fool possessed a wand that struck of itself, he wanted it so much that for a time he forgot all about the tablecloth, and sent some of his soldiers with orders to bring him back the wand.When they entered the cottage, the fool, as usual, was lying on the stove.“Deliver up the wand to us instantly,” said they; “the king is willing to pay any price you ask, but if you refuse he will take it from you by force.”Instead of replying the fool unwound the waistband, saying to it as he did so:“O marvellous, wonderful, lake-forming Band,For my safety, and not for my fun,Bear me in a boat on thy waves far from land,So that I from my foes need not run.”There was a shimmering in the air, while at the same moment everything around them disappeared, and a beautiful lake, long, wide, and deep, was seen, surrounded by green fields. Fish with golden scales and eyes of pearls played in the clear water. In the centre, in a small silver skiff, rowed a man, whom the soldiers recognised as the fool.They remained some time looking at this miracle, and then ran off to tell the king. Now when the king heard thereof he was so anxious to possess the lake, or rather the waistband that produced the lake, that he sent a whole battalion of soldiers to take the fool prisoner.This time they managed to get hold of him while he was asleep, but as they were about to tie his hands he turned his hat round and said:“O Magic Helmet, never thouDost want for powder nor shot,Allay my fears and fire nowJust where I point. Fail not.”Instantly a hundred bullets whistled through the air, amid clouds of smoke and loud reports. Many of the soldiers fell dead, others took refuge in the wood, whence they returned to the king to give an account of what had taken place.Whereupon the king flew into a violent rage, furious that he had as yet failed to take the fool. But his wish to possess the feast-giving tablecloth, the magic wand, the lake-forming sash, and above all the helmet with twenty-four horns, was stronger than ever.Having reflected for some days on the best ways and means to attain his object, he resolved to try the effect of kindness, and sent for the fool’s mother.“Tell your son, the fool,” said his majesty to the woman, “that my charming daughter and I send greeting, and that we shall consider it an honour if he will come here and show us the marvellous things he possesses. Should he feel inclined to make me a present of them, I will give him half my kingdom and will make him my heir. You may also say that the princess, my daughter, will choose him for her husband.”The good woman hastened home to her son, whom she advised to accept the king’s invitation and show him his treasures. The fool wound the waistband round his loins, put the helmet on his head, hid the tablecloth in his breast, took his magic wand in his hand, and started off to go to the court.The king was not there on his arrival, but he was received by the paladin, who saluted him courteously. Music played, and the troops did him military honours—in fact, he was treated far better than he had expected. On being presented to the king he took off his helmet, and bowing low, said: “O king, I am come to lay at the foot of your throne my tablecloth, waistband, wand, and helmet. In return for these gifts I beg that your favour may be shown to the most humble of your subjects.”“Tell me then, fool, what price you want for these goods?”“Not money, sire, a fool of my sort cares very little about money. Has not the king promised my mother that he will give me in exchange the half of his kingdom, and the hand of his daughter in marriage? These are the gifts I claim.”After these words the paladin was filled with envy at the good fortune of the fool, and made a sign for the guards to enter. The soldiers seized the poor fellow, dragged him out into the courtyard, and they killed him treacherously to the sound of drums and trumpets, after which they covered him over with earth.Now it happened that when the soldiers stabbed him his blood spurted out, and some of the drops fell beneath the princess’s window. The maiden wept bitterly at the sight, watering the blood-stained ground with her tears. And lo! marvellous to relate, an apple-tree grew out of the blood-sprinkled earth. And it grew so rapidly that its branches soon touched the windows of her rooms; by noon it was covered with blossom, while at eventide ripe red apples hung thereon. As the princess was admiring them she noticed that one of the apples trembled, and when she touched it, it fell into the bosom of her dress. This took her fancy, and she held it in her hand.Meanwhile the sun had set, night had fallen, and every one in the palace was asleep, except the guard, the paladin, and the princess. The guard, sword in hand, patrolled up and down, for it was his duty. The princess toyed with her pretty little apple, and could not sleep. The paladin, who had gone to bed, was aroused by a sound that made his blood run cold, for the avenging wand stood before him and began to beat him soundly. And although he rushed from the room trying to escape from it, it followed him, crying out:“False paladin, you worthless man,Do not so envious be;Why act unjustly, when you canBoth just and honest be?For others’ goods why have you such a liking?You rogue, you thief, be sure I’ll keep on striking.”The unhappy man wept and cried for mercy, but the wand still continued to strike.The princess was distressed on hearing these cries of distress, and she watered her much-cherished apple with her tears. And, strange to tell, the apple grew and changed its shape. Thus continuing to change, it suddenly turned into a handsome young man, even the very same who had been killed that morning.“Lovely princess, I salute you,” said the fool. “The cunning of the paladin caused my death, but with your tears you have restored me to life. Your father promised to give you to me: are you willing?”“If such be the king’s wish, I consent,” replied she, as she gave him her hand with a tender look.As he spoke the door opened, admitting the helmet, which placed itself upon his head; the sash, which wound itself round his waist; the tablecloth, which hid itself in one of his pockets; and the avenging wand, which placed itself in his hand. Then came the king, all out of breath, and wondering what the noise was about. He was amazed to see the fool alive again, and even more so that he should be with the princess.The young fellow, fearing the king’s wrath, cried out:“O marvellous, wonderful, lake-forming Band,For my safety, and not for my fun,Bear us in a boat on thy waves far from land,So that we from our foes need not run.”There was a shimmering in the air, and then everything disappeared, while on the lawn before the palace stretched a wide deep lake, in the crystal water of which swam little fish with eyes of pearl and scales of gold. Far away rowed the princess and the fool in a silver skiff. The king stood on the shores of the lake and signed to them to return. When they had landed they knelt at his feet and avowed their mutual love. Upon which his majesty bestowed his blessing, the lake disappeared, and they again found themselves in the princess’s apartments.The king called a special meeting of his council, at which he explained how things had turned out—that he had made the fool his heir, and betrothed him to his daughter, and had put the paladin in prison.The fool gave the king his magic treasures, and told him what words to say in each case.Next day all their wishes were fulfilled. The fool of the family was married to the princess, and at the same time received half the kingdom, with the promise of succession to the throne. And the wedding feast, to which all the rich and noble of the land were invited, exceeded in its magnificence and splendour any other festival ever seen or heard of.","['fisherman', 'plenty', 'money',

1633,slavic,The Wonderful Hair,"There once lived a man who was very poor, and who had many children; so many that he was unable to support them. As he could not endure the idea of their perishing of hunger, he was often tempted to destroy them; his wife alone prevented him. One night, as he lay asleep, there appeared to him a lovely child in a vision. The child said,—“Oh, man! I see your soul is in danger, in the thought of killing your helpless children. But I know you are poor, and am come here to help you. You will find under your pillow in the morning a looking-glass, a red handkerchief, and an embroidered scarf. Take these three things, but show them to no one, and go to the forest. In that forest you will find a rivulet. Walk by the side of this rivulet until you come to its source; there you will see a girl, as bright as the sun, with long hair streaming down her shoulders. Take care that she does you no harm. Say not a word to her; for if you utter a single syllable, she will change you into a fish, or some other creature, and eat you. Should she ask you to comb her hair, obey her. As you comb it, you will find one hair as red as blood; pull it out, and run away with it. Be swift, for she will follow you. Then throw on the ground, first the embroidered scarf, then the red handkerchief, and last of all the looking-glass; they will delay her pursuit of you. Sell the hair to some rich man; but see that you do not allow yourself to be cheated, for it is of boundless worth. Its produce will make you rich, and thus you will be able to feed your children.”Next morning, when the poor man awoke, he found under his pillow exactly the things the child had told him of in his dream. He went immediately into the forest, and when he had discovered the rivulet he walked by the side of it, on and on, until he reached its source. There he saw a girl sitting on the bank, threading a needle with the rays of the sun. She was embroidering a net made of the hair of heroes, spread on a frame before her. He approached and bowed to her. The girl got up and demanded,—”Where did you come from, strange knight?”The man remained silent. Again she asked him,—“Who are you, and why do you come here?” And many other questions. But he remained silent as a stone, indicating with his hands only that he was dumb and in need of help. She told him to sit at her feet, and when he had gladly done so, she inclined her head towards him, that he might comb her hair. He began to arrange her hair as if to comb it, but as soon as he had found the red one, he separated it from the rest, plucked it out, leapt up, and ran from her with his utmost speed.The girl sprang after him, and was soon at his heels. The man, turning round as he ran, and seeing that his pursuer would soon overtake him, threw the embroidered scarf on the ground, as he had been told. When the girl saw it, she stopped and began to examine it; turning it over on both sides, and admiring the embroidery. Meanwhile the man gained a considerable distance in advance. The girl tied the scarf round her bosom and recommenced the pursuit. When the man saw that she was again about to overtake him, he threw down the red handkerchief. At the sight of it, the girl again stopped, examined, and wondered at it; the peasant, in the meantime, was again enabled to increase the distance between them. When the girl perceived this, she became furious, and throwing away both scarf and handkerchief began to run with increased speed after him. She was just upon the point of catching the poor peasant, when he threw the looking-glass at her feet. At the sight of the looking-glass, the like of which she had never seen before, the girl checked herself, picked it up, and looked in it. Seeing her own face, she fancied there was another girl looking at her. While she was thus occupied the man ran so far that she could not possibly overtake him. When the girl saw that further pursuit was useless, she turned back, and the peasant, joyful and unhurt, reached his home. Once within doors he showed the hair to his wife and children, and told them all that had happened to him; but his wife only laughed at the story. The peasant, however, took no heed of her ridicule, but went to a neighbouring town to sell the hair. He was soon surrounded by a crowd of people, and some merchants began to bid for his prize. One merchant offered him one gold piece, another two, for the single hair, and so on, until the price rose to a hundred gold pieces. Meanwhile the king, hearing of the wonderful red hair, ordered the peasant to be called in, and offered him a thousand gold pieces for it. The man joyfully sold it for that sum.What wonderful kind of hair was this after all? The king split it carefully open from end to end, and in it was found the story of many marvellous secrets of nature, and of things that had happened since the creation of the world.Thus the peasant became rich, and henceforth lived happily with his wife and children. The child he had seen in his dream was an angel sent down from heaven to succour him, and to reveal to mankind the knowledge of many wonderful things which had hitherto remained unexplained.","['upon', 'time', 'three', 'sister', 'young', 'prettier', 'name', 'fatima', 'sister', 'dear', 'prettiest', 'fatima', 'reply', 'next', 'sister', 'rubbed', 'dirt', 'fatima', 'face',

1684,slavic,The Laughing Prince: The Boy Who Could Talk Nonsense,"There was once a farmer who had three sons and one little daughter. The eldest son was a studious boy who learned so much out of books that the farmer said:“We must send Mihailo to school and make a priest of him.”The second boy was a trader. Whatever you had he would get it from you by offering you something else for it. And always what he gave you was worth less than what you gave him.“Jakov will make a fine peddler,” the farmer said. “He’s industrious and sharp and some day he will probably be a rich man.”But Stefan, the farmer’s youngest son, had no special talent and because he didn’t spend all his time with his nose in a book and because he never made the best of a bargain his brothers scorned him. Militza, his little sister, loved him dearly for he was kind and jolly and in the evening he was always ready to tell her stories and play with her. But the farmer, of course, listened to the older brothers.“I don’t know about poor Stefan,” he used to say. “He’s a good boy but he talks nonsense. I suppose he’ll have to stay on the farm and work.”Now the truth is the farm was a fine place for Stefan for he was strong and lusty and he liked to plow and harvest and he had a wonderful way with the animals. He talked to them as if they were human beings and the horses all whinnied when he came near, and the cows rubbed their soft noses against his shoulder, and as for the pigs—they loved him so much that whenever they saw him they used to run squealing between his legs.“Stefan is nothing but a farmer!” Mihailo used to say as though being a farmer was something to be ashamed of.And Jakov said:“If the village people could see the pigs following him about, how they’d laugh at him! I hope when I go to the village to live he won’t be visiting me all the time!”Another thing the older brothers couldn’t understand about Stefan was why he was always laughing and joking. He did the work of two men but whether he was working or resting you could always hear him cracking his merry jokes and laughing his jolly laugh.“I think he’s foolish!” Mihailo said.Jakov hoped that the village people wouldn’t hear about his carryings on.“They’d laugh at him,” he said, “and they’d laugh at us, too, because we’re his brothers.”But Stefan didn’t care. The more they frowned at him, the louder he laughed, and in spite of their dark looks he kept on cracking his merry jokes and talking nonsense. And every evening after supper his little sister, Militza, clapped her hands and cried:“Now, Stefan, tell me a story! Tell me a story!”“Father,” Mihailo would say, “you ought to make him keep quiet! He’s foolish and all he does is fill Militza’s head with nonsense!”This always made Militza very indignant and she would stamp her little foot and say:“He isn’t foolish! He knows more than any one! And he can do more things than any one else and he’s the handsomest brother in the world!”You see Militza loved Stefan dearly and when you love a person of course you think that person is wonderful. But the father supposed that Mihailo must be right for Mihailo studied in books. So he shook his head and sighed every time he thought of Stefan.Now the kingdom in which the three brothers lived was ruled over by a great Tsar who had an only daughter. In disappointment that he had no son, the Tsar was having his daughter brought up as though she were a boy. He sent all over the world for tutors and teachers and had the poor girl taught statecraft and law and philosophy and all the other things that the heir to the throne ought to know.The Princess because she was an obedient girl and because she loved her father tried to spend all her time in study. But the dry old scholars whom the Tsar employed as teachers were not amusing companions for a young girl and the first lady-in-waiting who was in constant attendance was scarcely any better for she, too, was old and thin and very prim.If the poor little Princess between her geography lesson and her arithmetic lesson would peep for a moment into a mirror, the first lady-in-waiting would tap her arm reprovingly and say:“My dear, vanity is not becoming in a princess!”One day the little Princess lost her temper and answered sharply:“But I’m a girl even if I am a princess and I love to look in mirrors and I love to make myself pretty and I’d love to go to a ball every night of my life and dance with handsome young men!”“You talk like the daughter of a farmer!” the first lady-in-waiting said.Then the Princess, because she lost her temper still further, said something she should not have said.“I wish I were the daughter of a farmer!” she declared. “Then I could wear pretty ribbons and go dancing and the boys would come courting me! As it is I have to spend all my time with funny old men and silly old women!”Now even if her tutors and teachers were funny looking old men, even if the first lady-in-waiting was a silly old woman, the Princess should not have said so. It hurt the feelings of the first lady-in-waiting and made her angry and she ran off to the Tsar at once and complained most bitterly.“Is this my reward after all my years of loving service to your daughter?” she asked. “It is true that I’ve grown old and thin looking after her manners and now she calls me a silly old woman! And all the learned wise men and scholars that you have gathered from the far corners of the earth—she points her finger at them and calls them funny old men!”The fact is they were funny looking, most of them, but yet the first lady-in-waiting was right: the Princess should not have said so.“And think of her ingratitude to yourself, O Tsar!” the first lady-in-waiting continued. “You plan to make her the heir to your throne and yet she says she wishes she were a farmer’s daughter so that she could deck herself out in ribbons and have the boys come courting her! A nice thing for a princess to say!”The Tsar when he heard this fell into an awful rage. (The truth is whatever temper the Princess had she inherited direct from her father.)“Wow! Wow!” he roared, just that way. “Send the Princess to me at once. I’ll soon have her singing another tune!”So the first lady-in-waiting sent the Princess to her father and as soon as he saw her he began roaring again and saying:“Wow! Wow! What do you mean—funny old men and silly old women?”Now whenever the Tsar began roaring and saying, “Wow! Wow!” the Princess always stiffened, and instead of being the sweet and obedient daughter she usually was she became obstinate. Her pretty eyes would flash and her soft pretty face would harden and people would whisper: “Mercy on us, how much she looks like her father!”“That’s just what I mean!” the Princess said. “They’re a lot of funny old men and silly old women and I’m tired of them! I want to be amused! I want to laugh!”“Wow! Wow! Wow!” roared the Tsar. “A fine princess you are! Go straight back to the schoolroom and behave yourself!”So the little Princess marched out of the throne room holding her head very high and looking so much like the Tsar that the first lady-in-waiting was positively frightened.The Princess went back to the schoolroom but she did not behave herself. She was really very naughty. When the poor man who knew more than anybody in the world about the influence of the stars upon the destinies of nations came to give her a lesson, she threw his book out the window. When the superannuated old general who was teaching her military manœuvers offered her a diagram on which the enemy was represented by a series of black dots and our soldiers by a series of red dots, she took the paper and tore it in two. And worst of all when the old scholar who was teaching her Turkish—for a princess must be able to speak all languages—dropped his horn spectacles on the floor, she deliberately stepped on them and broke them.When the Tsar heard all these things he just wow-wowed something terrible.“Lock that young woman in her chamber!” he ordered. “Feed her on bread and water until she’s ready to apologize!”But the Princess, far from being frightened by this treatment, calmly announced:“I won’t eat even your old bread and water until you send me some one who will make me laugh!”Now this frightened the Tsar because he knew how obstinate the Princess could be on occasions. (He ought to know, too, for the Princess had that streak of obstinacy direct from himself.)“This will never do!” he said.He hurried to the Princess’s chamber. He found her in bed with her pretty hair spread out on the pillow like a golden fan.“My dear,” the Tsar said, “I was joking. You don’t have to eat only bread and water. You may have anything you want.”“Thank you,” the Princess said, “but I’ll never eat another bite of anything until you send me some one who will make me laugh. I’m tired of living in this gloomy old castle with a lot of old men and old women who do nothing but instruct me and with a father who always loses his temper and says, ‘Wow! Wow!'”“But it’s a beautiful castle!” the poor Tsar said. “And I’m sure we’re all doing our very best to educate you!”“But I want to be amused as well as educated!” the little Princess said. And then, because she felt she was going to cry, she turned her face to the wall and wouldn’t say another word.What was the Tsar to do? He called together his councilors and asked them how was the Princess to be made to laugh. The councilors were wise about state matters but not one of them could suggest a means of amusing the Princess. The Master of Ceremonies did indeed begin to say something about a nice young man but instantly the Tsar roared out such a wrathful, “Wow! Wow!” that the Master of Ceremonies coughed and pretended he hadn’t spoken.Then the Tsar called together the scholars and the teachers and the first lady-in-waiting. He glared at them savagely and roared:“Wow! Wow! A nice lot you are! I put you in charge of my daughter and not one of you has sense enough to know that the poor child needs a little amusement! I have a good mind to have you all thrown into the dungeon!”“But, Your Majesty,” quavered one poor old scholar, “I was not employed as a buffoon but as a teacher of astrology!”“And I,” another said, “as a teacher of languages!”“And I as a teacher of philosophy!”“Silence!” roared the Tsar. “Between you all you have about killed my poor child! Now I ask you: With all your learning doesn’t one of you know how to make a young girl laugh?”Apparently not one of them did, for no one answered.“Not even you?” the Tsar said, looking at the first lady-in-waiting.“When you called me to Court,” the first lady-in-waiting answered, drawing herself up in a most refined manner, “you said you wished me to teach your daughter etiquette. As you said nothing about amusement, quite naturally I confined myself to the subject of behavior. If I do say it myself, no one has ever been more devoted to duty than I. I am constantly saying to her: ‘That isn’t the way a princess should act!’ In fact for years there has hardly been a moment in the day when I haven’t corrected her for something!”“Poor child!” groaned the Tsar. “No wonder she wants a change! Oh, what fools you all are in spite of your learning! Don’t you know that a young girl is a young girl even if she is a Princess!”Well, the scholars weren’t any more help to the Tsar than the councilors, and finally in desperation he sent heralds through the land to announce that to any one who could make the Princess laugh he would give three bags of gold.Three bags of gold don’t grow on the bushes every day and instantly all the youths and men and old men who had stories that their sweethearts and their wives and their daughters laughed at hurried to the castle.One by one they were admitted to the Princess’s chamber. They entered hopefully but when they saw the Tsar sitting at one side of the door muttering, “Wow! Wow!” in his beard, and the old first lady-in-waiting at the other side of the door watching them scornfully, and the Princess herself in bed with her lovely hair spread out like a golden fan on the pillow, they forgot their funny stories and hemmed and hawed and stammered and had finally, one after another, to be turned out in disgrace.One day went by and two and three and still the Princess refused to eat. In despair the Tsar sent out his heralds again. This time he said that to any one who would make the Princess laugh he would give the Princess’s hand in marriage and make him joint heir to the kingdom.“I had expected to wed her to the son of some great Tsar,” he sighed, “but I’d rather marry her to a farmer than see her die of starvation!”The heralds rode far and wide until every one, even the people on the most distant farms, had heard of the Tsar’s offer.“I won’t try again,” said Mihailo, the oldest son of the farmer I’ve already told you about. “When I went there the day before yesterday I began telling her a funny story out of my Latin book but instead of laughing she said: ‘Oh, send him away!’ So now she’ll have to starve to death for all of me!”“Me, too!” said Jakov, the second son. “When I tried to tell her that funny story of how I traded the moldy oats for the old widow’s fat pig, instead of laughing she looked me straight in the face and said: ‘Cheat!'”“Stefan ought to go,” Mihailo suggested. “Maybe she’d laugh at him! Everybody else does!”He spoke sneeringly but Stefan only smiled.“Who knows? Perhaps I will go. If I do make her laugh then, O my brothers, the laugh will be on you for I shall become Tsar and you two will be known as my two poor brothers. Ho! Ho! Ho! What a joke that would be!”Stefan laughed loud and heartily and his little sister joined him, but his brothers looked at him sourly.“He grows more foolish all the time!” they told each other.When they were gone to bed, Militza slipped over to Stefan and whispered in his ear:“Brother, you must go to the Princess. Tell her the story that begins: In my young days when I was an old, old man…. I think she’ll just have to laugh, and if she laughs then she can eat and she must be very hungry by this time.”At first Stefan said no, he wouldn’t go, but Militza insisted and finally, to please her, he said he would.So early the next morning he dressed himself in his fine Sunday shirt with its blue and red embroidery. He put on his bright red Sunday sash and his long shiny boots. Then he mounted his horse and before his brothers were awake rode off to the Tsar’s castle.There he awaited his turn to be admitted to the Princess’s chamber. When he came in he was so young and healthy and vigorous that he seemed to bring with him a little of the freshness of outdoors. The first lady-in-waiting looked at him askance for without doubt he was a farmer lad and his table manners probably were not good. Well, he was a farmer lad and for that reason he didn’t know that she was first lady-in-waiting. He glanced at her once and thought: “What an ugly old woman!” and thereafter he didn’t think of her at all. He glanced likewise at the Tsar and the Tsar reminded him of a bull of his own. He wasn’t afraid of the bull, so why be afraid of the Tsar?Suddenly he saw the Princess lying in bed with her lovely hair spread out on the pillow like a golden fan and for a moment he couldn’t speak. Then he knelt beside the bed and kissed her hand.“Princess,” he said, “I’m not learned and I’m not clever and I don’t suppose I can succeed where so many wise men have failed. And even if I do make you laugh you won’t have to marry me unless you want to because the reason I really came was to please Militza.”“Yes, Princess, my little sister, Militza. She loves me very much and so she thinks the stories I tell are funny and she laughs at them. Last night she said to me: ‘Stefan, you must go to the Princess and tell her the story that begins: In my young days when I was an old, old man…. I think she’ll just have to laugh and if she laughs then she can eat and she must be very hungry by this time.'”“I am,” the Princess said, with a catch in her voice. Then she added: “I think I like that little sister of yours and I think I like you, too. I wish you would tell me the story that begins: In my young days when I was an old, old man….”“But, Princess, it’s a very foolish story.”“The foolisher, the better!”Just here the first lady-in-waiting tried to correct the Princess for of course she should have said: “The more foolish, the better!” but the Tsar shut her up with a black frown and one fierce, “Wow!”“Well, then,” Stefan began:In my young days when I was an old, old man I used to count my bees every morning. It was easy enough to count the bees but not the beehives because I had too many hives. One day when I finished counting I found that my best bee was missing. At once I saddled a rooster and set out to find him.“Father!” cried the Princess. “Did you hear what Stefan said? He said he saddled his rooster!”“Umph!” muttered the Tsar, and the first lady-in-waiting said severely:“Princess, do not interrupt! Young man, continue.”His track led to the sea which I rode across on a bridge. The first thing I saw on the other side of the sea was my bee. There he was in a field of millet harnessed to a plow. “That’s my bee!” I shouted to the man who was driving him. “Is that so?” the man said, and without any words he gave me back my bee and handed me a bag of millet to pay for the plowing. I took the bag and tied it securely on the bee. Then I unsaddled the rooster and mounted the bee. The rooster, poor thing, was so tired that I had to take him by the hand and lead him along beside us.“Father!” the Princess cried, “did you hear that? He took the rooster by the hand! Isn’t that funny!”“Umph!” grunted the Tsar, and the first lady-in-waiting whispered:“Hush! Let the young man finish!”Whilst we were crossing the bridge, the string of the bag broke and all my millet spilled out. When night came I tied the rooster to the bee and lay down on the seashore to sleep. During the night some wolves came and killed my bee and when I woke up I found that all the honey had run out of his body. There was so much honey that it rose up and up until it reached the ankles of the valleys and the knees of the mountains. I took a hatchet and swam down to a forest where I found two deer leaping about on one leg. I shot at the deer with my hatchet, killed them, and skinned them. With the skins I made two leather bottles. I filled these with the honey and strapped them over the rooster’s back. Then I rode home. I no sooner arrived home than my father was born. “We must have holy water for the christening,” I said. “I suppose I must go to heaven to fetch some.” But how was I to get there? I thought of my millet. Sure enough the dampness had made it grow so well that its tops now reached the sky. So all I had to do was to climb a millet stalk and there I was in heaven. Up there they had mown down some of my millet which they baked into a loaf and were eating with boiled milk. “That’s my millet!” I said. “What do you want for it?” they asked me. “I want some holy water to christen my father who has just been born.” So they gave me some holy water and I prepared to descend again to earth. But on earth there was a violent storm going on and the wind carried away my millet. So there I was with no way of getting down. I thought of my hair. It was so long that when I stood up it covered my ears and when I lay down it reached all the way to earth. So I pulled out a hair, tied it to a tree of heaven, and began descending by it. When it grew dark I made a knot in the hair and just sat where I was. It was cold, so I took a needle which I happened to have in my coat, split it up, and lighted a fire with the chips.“Oh, father!” the Princess cried, “Stefan says he split a needle into kindling wood! Isn’t he funny!”“If you ask me—” the first lady-in-waiting began, but before she could say more the Tsar reached over and stepped on her toe so hard that she was forced to end her sentence with a little squeally, “Ouch!” The Princess, you see, was smiling and the Tsar was hoping that presently she would burst into a laugh. So he motioned Stefan to continue.Then I lay down beside the fire and fell asleep. While I slept a spark from the fire fell on the hair and burned it through. I fell to earth with such force that I sank into the ground up to my chest. I couldn’t budge, so I was forced to go home and get a spade and dig myself out. On the way home I crossed a field where the reapers were cutting corn. The heat was so great that they had to stop work.”I’ll get our mare,” I said, “and then you’ll feel cooler.” You know our mare is two days long and as broad as midnight and she has willow trees growing on her back. So I ran and got her and she cast such a cool shadow that the reapers were at once able to go back to work. Now they wanted some fresh drinking water, but when they went to the river they found it had frozen over. They came back to me and asked me would I get them some water. “Certainly,” I said. I went to the river myself, then I took off my head and with it I broke a hole in the ice. After that it was easy enough to fetch them some water. “But where is your head?” they asked. “Oh!” I said, “I must have forgotten it!”“Oh, father!” the Princess cried with a loud laugh, “he says he forgot his head! Then, Stefan, what did you do? What did you do?”I ran back to the river and got there just as a fox was sniffing at my skull. “Hi, there!” I said, pulling the fox’s tail. The fox turned around and gave me a paper on which was written these words: NOW THE PRINCESS CAN EAT FOR SHE HAS LAUGHED AND STEFAN AND HIS LITTLE SISTER ARE VERY HAPPY.“What nonsense!” the first lady-in-waiting murmured with a toss of her head.“Yes, beautiful nonsense!” the Princess cried, clapping her hands and going off into peal after peal of merry laughter. “Isn’t it beautiful nonsense, father? And isn’t Stefan a dear lad? And, father, I’m awfully hungry! Please have some food sent in at once and Stefan must stay and eat with me.”So the Tsar had great trays of food brought in: roast birds and vegetables and wheaten bread and many kinds of little cakes and honey and milk and fruit. And Stefan and the Princess ate and made merry and the Tsar joined them and even the first lady-in-waiting took one little cake which she crumbled in her handkerchief in a most refined manner.Then Stefan rose to go and the Tsar said to him:“Stefan, I will reward you richly. You have made the Princess laugh and besides you have not insisted on her marrying you. You are a fine lad and I shall never forget you.”“But, father,” the Princess said, “I don’t want Stefan to go. He amuses me and I like him. He said. I needn’t marry him unless I wanted to but, father, I think I want to.”“Wow! Wow!” the Tsar roared. “What! My daughter marry the son of a farmer!”“Now, father,” the Princess said, “it’s no use your wow-wowing at me and you know it isn’t. If I can’t marry Stefan I won’t marry any one. And if I don’t marry any one I’m going to stop eating again. So that’s that!” And still holding Stefan’s hand, the Princess turned her face to the wall.What could the poor Tsar do? At first he fumed and raged but as usual after a day or two he came around to the Princess’s way of thinking. In fact it soon seemed to him that Stefan had been his choice from the first and when one of his councilors remarked: “Then, Your Majesty, there’s no use sending word to the neighboring kings that the Princess has reached a marriageable age and would like to look over their sons,” the Tsar flew into an awful temper and roared:“Wow! Wow! You blockhead! Neighboring kings, indeed, and their good-for-nothing sons! No, siree! The husband I want for my daughter is an honest farmer lad who knows how to work and how to play! That’s the kind of son-in-law we need in this kingdom!So Stefan and the little Princess were married and from that day the castle was no longer gloomy but rang with laughter and merriment. Presently the people of the kingdom, following the example of their rulers, were laughing, too, and cracking jokes and, strange to say, they soon found they were working all the better for their jollity.Laughter grew so fashionable that even Mihailo and Jakov were forced to take it up. They didn’t do it very well but they practised at it conscientiously. Whenever people talked about Stefan, they always pushed forward importantly and said:“Ho! Ho! Ho! Do you mean Stefan, the Laughing Prince? Ha! Ha! Ha! Why, do you know, he’s our own brother!”As for Militza, the Princess had her come to the castle and said to her:“I owe all my happiness to you, my dear, for you it was who knew that of course I would laugh at Stefan’s nonsense! What sensible girl wouldn’t?”","['time', 'little', 'girl', 'whose', 'father', 'mother', 'dead', 'poor', 'longer', 'little', 'room', 'live', 'sleep', 'last', 'nothing', 'else', 'clothes', 'wear',

1700,slavic,Tears of Pearls,"Once upon a time there lived a very rich widow, with whom lived three children—a handsome stepson; his sister, who was marvellously beautiful; and her own daughter, passably good-looking.All three children lived under the same roof, but, as is often the case where there are step-parents, they were treated very differently. The lady’s own daughter was bad-tempered, disobedient, vain, and of a tell-tale disposition: yet she was made much of, praised, and caressed. The step-children were treated very harshly: the boy, kind-hearted and obliging, was made to do all sorts of hard unpleasant work, was constantly scolded, and looked upon as a good-for-nothing. The step-daughter, who was not only exceedingly pretty but was as sweet as an angel, was found fault with on all occasions, and her life made utterly miserable.It is, after all, but natural to love one’s own children better than those of others, but the feeling of love should be governed by the laws of fairness. Now this wicked woman was blind to the faults of the child she loved, and to the good qualities of her husband’s children, whom she hated.When in a bad temper she was fond of boasting of the handsome fortune she intended securing for her own daughter, even though the step-children should be unprovided for. But, as the old proverb says, “Man proposes, but God disposes.” We shall therefore see how things turned out.One Sunday morning, before going to church, the step-daughter went into the garden to pick some flowers for decorating the altar. She had only gathered a few roses when, looking up, she saw quite close to her three young men robed in dazzling white garments. They sat on a bench shaded by shrubs, while near them was an old man who asked her for alms.She felt rather nervous before the strangers, but when she saw the old man she took her last penny from her purse and gave it him. He thanked her, and raising his hand over the girl’s head, said to the men: “This orphan girl is pious, patient under misfortune, and kind to the poor, with whom she shares the little she has. Tell me what you wish for her.”The first said, “I wish that when she weeps her tears may be changed into so many pearls.”“And I,” replied the second, “that when she smiles sweet roses may fall from her lips.”“My wish,” said the third, “is that whenever she dips her hands into water there shall appear in it shining gold-fish.”“All these gifts shall be hers,” added the old man. And with these words they vanished.The maiden was filled with awe, and fell on her knees in prayer. Then her heart was filled with joy and peace, and she went back into the house. She had scarcely crossed the threshold when her stepmother came forward, and looking at her sternly, said, “Well, where have you been?”The poor child began to cry, when—marvel of marvels—instead of tears, pearls fell from her eyes.Notwithstanding her rage, the stepmother picked them up as quickly as possible, while the girl smiled as she watched her. And as she smiled roses fell from her lips, and her stepmother was beside herself with delight.The girl then went to put the flowers she had gathered in water; and as she dipped her fingers in it while arranging them, pretty little gold-fish appeared in the bowl.From that day these marvels were constantly occurring; the tears were changed into pearls, the smiles scattered roses, and the water, even if she dipped but the tips of her fingers in, was filled with gold-fish.The stepmother softened and became more gentle, while little by little she managed to draw from her step-child the secret of these gifts.So next Sunday morning she sent her own daughter into the garden to gather flowers, under pretence of their being for the altar. When she had picked a few, she raised her eyes and saw the three young men sitting on a low seat, while near them stood the little old man with white hair, begging for alms. She pretended to be shy before the young men, but at the beggar’s request drew from her pocket a gold piece, and gave it him, evidently much against her will. He put it in his pocket, and turning to his companions, said: “This girl is the spoilt child of her mother; she is bad-tempered and naughty, while her heart is hardened against the poor. It is easy to understand why, for the first time in her life, she has been so generous to-day. Tell me what gifts you would wish me to bestow upon her.”The first said, “May her tears be changed into lizards.”“And her smile produce hideous toads,” added the second.“And when her hands touch the water may it be filled with serpents,” said the third.“So let it be,” cried the old man. And they all vanished.The poor girl was terrified, and went back to tell her mother what had happened. And it was even so; for if she smiled hideous toads fell from her mouth, her tears were changed into lizards, and the water in which she dipped but the tips of her fingers was filled with serpents.The stepmother was in despair, but she only loved her child the more, and hated the orphans with a yet more bitter hatred. Indeed, she worried them to such an extent that the boy determined to put up with it no longer, but to seek his fortune elsewhere. So he tied up his belongings in a handkerchief, took a loving farewell of his sister, commending her to God’s care, and left his home. The great world lay before him, but which path to take he knew not. Turning to the cemetery where his parents lay side by side, he wept and prayed, kissed the earth that covered them three times, and set off on his travels.At that moment he felt something hard in the folds of his tunic, and pressing on his heart. Wondering what it could be, he put in his hand and drew thence a charming portrait of his dearly loved sister, surrounded with pearls, roses, and gold-fish. So great was his astonishment he could hardly believe his eyes. But he was very happy, and kissed the picture over and over again; then, with one more look at the cemetery, he made the sign of the cross and departed.Now a beautiful story is soon told, but the acts of which it is the sum pass more slowly.After many adventures of little importance he reached the capital of a kingdom by the sea, and there obtained the post of under-gardener at the royal palace, with good food and wages.In his prosperity he did not forget his unhappy sister, for he felt very uneasy about her. When he had a few moments to himself he would sit down in some retired spot and gaze upon her portrait with a sad heart and eyes filled with tears. For the picture was a faithful likeness of her, and he looked upon it as a gift from his parents.Now the king had noticed this habit of his, and one day while he sat by a stream looking at the picture he came quietly behind him, and glanced over his shoulder to see what he was so attentively regarding.“Give me that portrait,” said the monarch.The boy handed it him. The king examined it closely, and admiring it greatly, said: “I have never seen such a beautiful face in all my life, never even dreamed of such loveliness. Come, tell me, is the original of the picture living?”The lad burst into tears, and told him it was the living image of his sister, who a short time since had received as a special mark of favour from God, that her tears should be changed into pearls, her smiles into roses, and the touch of her hands in water should produce beautiful gold-fish.The king commanded him to write to his stepmother at once and bid her send her lovely step-daughter to the chapel of the palace, where the king would be waiting to marry her. The letter also contained promises of special royal favours.The lad wrote the letter, which the king sent by a special messenger.Now a good story is soon told, but the deeds of which it is the sum are not performed so quickly.When the stepmother received the letter she determined to say nothing about it to her step-child, but she showed it to her own daughter, and talked the matter over with her. Then she went to learn the art of sorcery from a witch, and having found out all it was necessary to know, set off with both of the girls. On approaching the capital, the wicked woman pushed her step-child out of the carriage and repeated some magic words over her. After this she became very small and covered with feathers, then in a moment she was changed into a wild-duck. She began to quack, and made for the water, as ducks do, and swam to a far distance. The stepmother bade her farewell in the following words: “By the strength of my hate may my will be fulfilled. Swim about the banks in the form of a duck, and rejoice in thy liberty. During that time my daughter shall take thy form, shall marry the king, and shall enjoy the good fortune fate destined for thee.”At the conclusion of these words her own child became endowed with all the graces and beauty of her unfortunate step-sister. The two then continued their journey, arriving at the royal chapel at the appointed hour. The king received them with all honours, while the deceitful woman gave away her own daughter, whom the bridegroom believed to be the original of the beautiful picture. After the ceremony the mother went away loaded with presents. The king, as he looked at his young wife, could not understand why he did not feel for her the sympathy and admiration he had felt for the portrait she so much resembled. But it could not be altered now; what is done is done. So he admired her beauty and looked forward to the pleasure of seeing pearls fall from her eyes, roses from her lips, and gold-fish at the touch of her fingers.During the wedding feast the newly-made bride forgot herself and smiled at her husband; immediately a number of hideous toads escaped from her lips. The king, overcome with horror and disgust, rushed away from her, upon which she began to cry, but instead of pearls, lizards fell from her eyes. The majordomo ordered water to be brought for her to wash her hands, but no sooner had she dipped the tips of her fingers in the bowl than it was filled with serpents that hissed and twisted and threw themselves among the wedding guests. The panic was general, and a scene of great confusion followed. The guard was called in, and had the greatest trouble to clear the hall of the disgusting reptiles.The bridegroom had taken refuge in the garden, and when he saw the young man coming towards him, whom he thought had deceived him, his anger overcame him, and he struck the poor lad with so much force that he fell down dead.The queen ran forward sobbing, and taking the king by the hand, said: “What have you done? You have killed my innocent brother. It is neither my fault, nor was it his, that since the wedding I have by some enchantment lost the marvellous power I possessed before. This evil will pass away in time, but time can never restore to me my dear brother, my own mother’s son.”“Forgive me, dear wife; in a moment of irritation I thought he had deceived me, and I wanted to punish him, but did not mean to kill. I regret it deeply, but it cannot be helped now. Forgive me my fault as I forgive yours, with all my heart.”“You have my forgiveness, but I beg you to see that your wife’s brother has an honourable burial.”Her wishes were carried out, and the orphan lad, who had passed as her brother, was laid in a handsome coffin. The chapel was hung with black, and at night a guard was placed both inside and out.Towards midnight the church doors silently opened, and while the guards were overcome by sleep a pretty little duck entered unnoticed. She stopped in the middle of the aisle, shook herself, and pulled out her feathers one by one. Then it took the form of the beautiful step-daughter, for it was she. She went up to her brother’s coffin and stood gazing at him, and as she looked she wept sorrowfully. Then she put on her feathers again and went out a duck. When the guards awoke they were astonished to find a quantity of fine pearls in the coffin. Next day they told the king that the doors had opened of themselves towards midnight, that they had been overcome by sleep, and that on awakening they had found a large number of pearls in the coffin, but knew not how they got there. The king was very much surprised, especially at the appearance of the pearls, that ought to have been produced by his wife’s tears. On the second night he doubled the guard, and impressed upon them the necessity for watchfulness.At midnight the doors again opened silently as before, the soldiers went to sleep, and the same little duck entered, and, taking out her feathers, appeared as a lovely maiden. She could not help smiling as she looked upon the sleeping soldiers, the number of which had been doubled on her account; and as she smiled a number of roses fell from her lips. As she drew near her brother her tears fell in torrents, leaving a profusion of fine pearls. After some time she put on her feathers and went out a duck. When the guards awoke they took the roses and the pearls to the king. He was still more surprised to see roses with the pearls, for these roses should have fallen from his wife’s lips. He again increased the number of the guard, and threatened them with the most severe punishment if they failed to watch all night. They did their best to obey, but in vain; they could only sleep. When they awoke they found, not only roses and pearls, but little gold-fish swimming in the holy water.The amazed king could only conclude that their sleep was caused by magic. On the fourth night he not only increased the number of soldiers, but, unknown to every one, hid himself behind the altar, where he hung a mirror, through which he could see everything that passed without being seen.At midnight the doors opened. The soldiers, under the influence of sleep, had let fall their arms and lay on the ground. The king kept his eyes fixed on the mirror, through which he saw a little wild-duck enter. It looked timidly round on all sides, then, reassured at the sight of the sleeping guards, advanced to the centre of the nave and took off its feathers, thus appearing as a young maiden of exquisite beauty.The king, overwhelmed with joy and admiration, had a presentiment that this was his true bride. So when she drew near the coffin he crept noiselessly out of his hiding-place, and with a lighted taper set fire to the feathers. They flared up immediately, and with such a bright light that the soldiers were aroused. The girl ran towards the monarch, wringing her hands and weeping tears of pearl.“What have you done?” cried she. “How can I now escape my stepmother’s vengeance? For it is by her magic that I have been changed into a wild-duck.”When the king had heard all, he ordered some of his soldiers to seize the wife he had married and to take her right out of the country. He sent others to take the wicked stepmother prisoner, and to burn her as a witch. Both commands were instantly carried out. Meanwhile the girl drew from the folds of her gown three small bottles, filled with three different kinds of water, which she had brought from the sea.The first possessed the virtue of restoring life. This she sprinkled over her brother, whereupon the chill and rigidity of death disappeared, the colour came to his face, and warm red blood flowed from his wound. Upon the wound she poured water from the second bottle, and it was immediately healed. When she had made use of the third kind of water he opened his eyes, looked at her with astonishment, and threw himself joyfully into her arms.The king, enraptured at this sight, conducted the two back to the palace.So instead of a funeral there was a wedding, to which a large number of guests were immediately invited. Thus the orphan maid was married to the king, while her brother became one of his majesty’s nobles. And the magnificence of the wedding feast was greater than anything seen or heard of.","['know', 'sort', 'world', 'good', 'people', 'fear', 'feel', 'shame', 'brother', 'certain', 'kingdom', 'certain',

1711,slavic,The Goat's Ears of the Emperor,"Once upon a time there lived an emperor whose name was Trojan, and he had ears like a goat. Every morning, when he was shaved, he asked if the man saw anything odd about him, and as each fresh barber always replied that the emperor had goat’s ears, he was at once ordered to be put to death.Now after this state of things had lasted a good while, there was hardly a barber left in the town that could shave the emperor, and it came to be the turn of the Master of the Company of Barbers to go up to the palace. But, unluckily, at the very moment that he should have set out, the master fell suddenly ill, and told one of his apprentices that he must go in his stead.When the youth was taken to the emperor’s bedroom, he was asked why he had come and not his master. The young man replied that the master was ill, and there was no one but himself who could be trusted with the honour. The emperor was satisfied with the answer, and sat down, and let a sheet of fine linen be put round him. Directly the young barber began his work, he, like the rest, remarked the goat’s ears of the emperor, but when he had finished and the emperor asked his usual question as to whether the youth had noticed anything odd about him, the young man replied calmly, ‘No, nothing at all.’ This pleased the emperor so much that he gave him twelve ducats, and said, ‘Henceforth you shall come every day to shave me.’So when the apprentice returned home, and the master inquired how he had got on with the emperor, the young man answered, ‘Oh, very well, and he says I am to shave him every day, and he has given me these twelve ducats’; but he said nothing about the goat’s ears of the emperor.From this time the apprentice went regularly up to the palace, receiving each morning twelve ducats in payment. But after a while, his secret, which he had carefully kept, burnt within him, and he longed to tell it to somebody. His master saw there was something on his mind, and asked what it was. The youth replied that he had been tormenting himself for some months, and should never feel easy until some one shared his secret.‘Well, trust me,’ said the master, ‘I will keep it to myself; or, if you do not like to do that, confess it to your pastor, or go into some field outside the town and dig a hole, and, after you have dug it, kneel down and whisper your secret three times into the hole. Then put back the earth and come away.’The apprentice thought that this seemed the best plan, and that very afternoon went to a meadow outside the town, dug a deep hole, then knelt and whispered to it three times over, ‘The Emperor Trojan has goat’s ears.’ And as he said so a great burden seemed to roll off him, and he shovelled the earth carefully back and ran lightly home.Weeks passed away, and there sprang up in the hole an elder tree which had three stems, all as straight as poplars. Some shepherds, tending their flocks near by, noticed the tree growing there, and one of them cut down a stem to make flutes of; but, directly he began to play, the flute would do nothing but sing: ‘The Emperor Trojan has goat’s ears.’ Of course, it was not long before the whole town knew of this wonderful flute and what it said; and, at last, the news reached the emperor in his palace. He instantly sent for the apprentice and said to him:‘What have you been saying about me to all my people?’The culprit tried to defend himself by saying that he had never told anyone what he had noticed; but the emperor, instead of listening, only drew his sword from its sheath, which so frightened the poor fellow that he confessed exactly what he had done, and how he had whispered the truth three times to the earth, and how in that very place an elder tree had sprung up, and flutes had been cut from it, which would only repeat the words he had said. Then the emperor commanded his coach to be made ready, and he took the youth with him, and they drove to the spot, for he wished to see for himself whether the young man’s confession was true; but when they reached the place only one stem was left. So the emperor desired his attendants to cut him a flute from the remaining stem, and, when it was ready, he ordered his chamberlain to play on it. But no tune could the chamberlain play, though he was the best flute player about the court–nothing came but the words, ‘The Emperor Trojan has goat’s ears.’ Then the emperor knew that even the earth gave up its secrets, and he granted the young man his life, but he never allowed him to be his barber any more.","['bathing', 'river', 'depth', 'great', 'danger', 'drown', 'passing', 'along', 'road', 'heard', 'help', 'riverside', 'begin', 'scold', 'careless', 'deep', 'water', 'make', 'attempt', 'help', 'please', 'help', 'first', 'scold', 'afterwards', 'give', 'assistance', 'advice', 'crisis']","['upon', 'time', 'live', 'emperor', 'whose_name', 'trojan', 'like', 'goat', 'every_morning', 'shave', 'anything', 'fresh', 'barber', 'always', 'reply', 'emperor', 'goat', 'order', 'death', 'state', 'thing', 'last', 'good', 'hardly', 'barber', 'left', 'town', 'could', 'shave', 'emperor', 'come', 'turn', 'master', 'company', 'barber', 'palace', 'unluckily', 'moment', 'master', 'fell', 'suddenly', 'told', 'apprentice', 'must', 'stead', 'youth', 'take', 'emperor', 'bedroom', 'come', 'master', 'young', 'reply', 'master', 'could', 'trust', 'honour', 'emperor', 'satisfied', 'answer', 'sheet', 'fine_linen', 'round', 'directly', 'young', 'barber', 'begin', 'work', 'like', 'rest', 'remark', 'goat', 'emperor', 'finish', 'emperor', 'usual', 'question', 'whether', 'youth', 'notice', 'anything', 'young', 'reply', 'calmly', 'nothing', 'pleased', 'emperor', 'much', 'give', 'twelve', 'ducat', 'henceforth', 'shall', 'come', 'every', 'shave', 'apprentice', 'return_home', 'master', 'inquire', 'emperor', 'young', 'answer', 'well', 'shave', 'every', 'give', 'twelve', 'ducat', 'nothing', 'goat', 'emperor', 'time', 'apprentice', 'regularly', 'palace', 'receive', 'morning', 'twelve', 'ducat', 'payment', 'secret', 'carefully', 'kept', 'burnt', 'within', 'long', 'tell', 'somebody', 'master', 'something', 'mind', 'youth', 'reply', 'torment', 'month', 'never', 'feel', 'easy', 'share', 'secret', 'well', 'trust', 'master', 'keep', 'like', 'confess', 'pastor', 'field', 'outside_town', 'hole', 'kneel', 'whisper', 'secret', 'three', 'time', 'hole', 'back', 'earth', 'come', 'away', 'apprentice', 'thought', 'seem', 'best', 'plan', 'afternoon', 'meadow', 'outside_town', 'deep_hole', 'knelt', 'whisper', 'three', 'time', 'emperor', 'trojan', 'goat', 'great', 'burden', 'seem', 'roll', 'shovel', 'earth', 'carefully', 'back', 'lightly', 'home', 'week_pass', 'away', 'sprang', 'hole', 'elder', 'tree', 'three', 'stem', 'straight', 'poplar', 'shepherd', 'tend_flock', 'near', 'notice', 'tree', 'grow', 'stem', 'make', 'flute', 'directly', 'begin', 'play_flute', 'would', 'nothing', 'sing', 'emperor', 'trojan', 'goat', 'course', 'long', 'whole', 'town', 'knew', 'wonderful', 'flute', 'last', 'news', 'reach', 'emperor', 'palace', 'instantly', 'sent', 'apprentice', 'people', 'culprit', 'defend', 'never', 'told', 'anyone', 'notice', 'emperor', 'instead', 'listen', 'drew_sword', 'sheath', 'frighten', 'poor_fellow', 'confess', 'exactly', 'whisper', 'truth', 'three', 'time', 'earth', 'place', 'elder', 'tree', 'sprung', 'flute', 'would', 'repeat_word', 'emperor', 'command', 'coach', 'make', 'ready', 'take', 'youth', 'drove', 'spot', 'wish', 'whether', 'young', 'confession', 'true', 'reach', 'place', 'stem', 'left', 'emperor', 'desire', 'attendant', 'flute', 'remain', 'stem', 'ready', 'order', 'chamberlain', 'play_tune', 'could', 'chamberlain', 'play', 'though', 'best', 'flute', 'player', 'court–nothing', 'come', 'word', 'emperor', 'trojan', 'goat', 'emperor', 'knew', 'even', 'earth', 'give', 'secret', 'grant', 'young', 'life', 'never', 'allow', 'barber']",slavic,sid1711
1862,slavic,"Long, Broad and Quick-Eye","Once upon a time there lived a king who had an only son whom he loved dearly. Now one day the king sent for his son and said to him:‘My dearest child, my hair is grey and I am old, and soon I shall feel no more the warmth of the sun, or look upon the trees and flowers. But before I die I should like to see you with a good wife; therefore marry, my son, as speedily as possible.’‘My father,’ replied the prince, ‘now and always, I ask nothing better than to do your bidding, but I know of no daughter-in-law that I could give you.’On hearing these words the old king drew from his pocket a key of gold, and gave it to his son, saying:‘Go up the staircase, right up to the top of the tower. Look carefully round you, and then come and tell me which you like best of all that you see.’So the young man went up. He had never before been in the tower, and had no idea what it might contain.The staircase wound round and round and round, till the prince was almost giddy, and every now and then he caught sight of a large room that opened out from the side. But he had been told to go to the top, and to the top he went. Then he found himself in a hall, which had an iron door at one end. This door he unlocked with his golden key, and he passed through into a vast chamber which had a roof of blue sprinkled with golden stars, and a carpet of green silk soft as turf. Twelve windows framed in gold let in the light of the sun, and on every window was painted the figure of a young girl, each more beautiful than the last. While the prince gazed at them in surprise, not knowing which he liked best, the girls began to lift their eyes and smile at him. He waited, expecting them to speak, but no sound came.Suddenly he noticed that one of the windows was covered by a curtain of white silk.He lifted it, and saw before him the image of a maiden beautiful as the day and sad as the tomb, clothed in a white robe, having a girdle of silver and of pearls. The prince stood and gazed at her, as if he had been turned into stone, but as he looked the sadness which, was on her face seemed to pass into his heart, and he cried out:‘This one shall be my wife. This one and no other.’As he said the words the young girl blushed and hung her head, and all the other figures vanished.The young prince went quickly back to his father, and told him all he had seen and which wife he had chosen. The old man listened to him full of sorrow, and then he spoke:‘You have done ill, my son, to search out that which was hidden, and you are running to meet a great danger. This young girl has fallen into the power of a wicked sorcerer, who lives in an iron castle. Many young men have tried to deliver her, and none have ever come back. But what is done is done! You have given your word, and it cannot be broken. Go, dare your fate, and return to me safe and sound.’So the prince embraced his father, mounted his horse, and set forth to seek his bride. He rode on gaily for several hours, till he found himself in a wood where he had never been before, and soon lost his way among its winding paths and deep valleys. He tried in vain to see where he was: the thick trees shut out the sun, and he could not tell which was north and which was south, so that he might know what direction to make for. He felt in despair, and had quite given up all hope of getting out of this horrible place, when he heard a voice calling to him.‘Hey! hey! stop a minute!’The prince turned round and saw behind him a very tall man, running as fast as his legs would carry him.‘Wait for me,’ he panted, ‘and take me into your service. If you do, you will never be sorry.’‘Who are you?’ asked the prince, ‘and what can you do?’‘Long is my name, and I can lengthen my body at will. Do you see that nest up there on the top of that pine-tree? Well, I can get it for you without taking the trouble of climbing the tree,’ and Long stretched himself up and up and up, till he was very soon as tall as the pine itself. He put the nest in his pocket, and before you could wink your eyelid he had made himself small again, and stood before the prince.‘Yes; you know your business,’ said he, ‘but birds’ nests are no use to me. I am too old for them. Now if you were only able to get me out of this wood, you would indeed be good for something.’‘Oh, there’s no difficulty about that,’ replied Long, and he stretched himself up and up and up till he was three times as tall as the tallest tree in the forest. Then he looked all round and said, ‘We must go in this direction in order to get out of the wood,’ and shortening himself again, he took the prince’s horse by the bridle, and led him along. Very soon they got clear of the forest, and saw before them a wide plain ending in a pile of high rocks, covered here and there with trees, and very much like the fortifications of a town.As they left the wood behind, Long turned to the prince and said, ‘My lord, here comes my comrade. You should take him into your service too, as you will find him a great help.’‘Well, call him then, so that I can see what sort of a man he is.’‘He is a little too far off for that,’ replied Long. ‘He would hardly hear my voice, and he couldn’t be here for some time yet, as he has so much to carry. I think I had better go and bring him myself,’ and this time he stretched himself to such a height that his head was lost in the clouds. He made two or three strides, took his friend on his back, and set him down before the prince. The new-comer was a very fat man, and as round as a barrel.‘Who are you?’ asked the prince, ‘and what can you do?’‘Your worship, Broad is my name, and I can make myself as wide as I please.’‘Let me see how you manage it.’‘Run, my lord, as fast as you can, and hide yourself in the wood,’ cried Broad, and he began to swell himself out.The prince did not understand why he should run to the wood, but when he saw Long flying towards it, he thought he had better follow his example. He was only just in time, for Broad had so suddenly inflated himself that he very nearly knocked over the prince and his horse too. He covered all the space for acres round. You would have thought he was a mountain!At length Broad ceased to expand, drew a deep breath that made the whole forest tremble, and shrank into his usual size.‘You have made me run away,’ said the prince. ‘But it is not every day one meets with a man of your sort. I will take you into my service.’So the three companions continued their journey, and when they were drawing near the rocks they met a man whose eyes were covered by a bandage.‘Your excellency,’ said Long, ‘this is our third comrade. You will do well to take him into your service, and, I assure you, you will find him worth his salt.’‘Who are you?’ asked the prince. ‘And why are your eyes bandaged? You can never see your way!’‘It is just the contrary, my lord! It is because I see only too well that I am forced to bandage my eyes. Even so I see as well as people who have no bandage. When I take it off my eyes pierce through everything. Everything I look at catches fire, or, if it cannot catch fire, it falls into a thousand pieces. They call me Quickeye.’And so saying he took off his bandage and turned towards the rock. As he fixed his eyes upon it a crack was heard, and in a few moments it was nothing but a heap of sand. In the sand something might be detected glittering brightly. Quickeye picked it up and brought it to the prince. It turned out to be a lump of pure gold.‘You are a wonderful creature,’ said the prince, ‘and I should be a fool not to take you into my service. But since your eyes are so good, tell me if I am very far from the Iron Castle, and what is happening there just now.’‘If you were travelling alone,’ replied Quickeye, ‘it would take you at least a year to get to it; but as we are with you, we shall arrive there to-night. Just now they are preparing supper.’‘There is a princess in the castle. Do you see her?’‘A wizard keeps her in a high tower, guarded by iron bars.’‘Ah, help me to deliver her!’ cried the prince.And they promised they would.Then they all set out through the grey rocks, by the breach made by the eyes of Quickeye, and passed over great mountains and through deep woods. And every time they met with any obstacle the three friends contrived somehow to put it aside. As the sun was setting, the prince beheld the towers of the Iron Castle, and before it sank beneath the horizon he was crossing the iron bridge which led to the gates. He was only just in time, for no sooner had the sun disappeared altogether, than the bridge drew itself up and the gates shut themselves.There was no turning back now!The prince put up his horse in the stable, where everything looked as if a guest was expected, and then the whole party marched straight up to the castle. In the court, in the stables, and all over the great halls, they saw a number of men richly dressed, but every one turned into stone. They crossed an endless set of rooms, all opening into each other, till they reached the dining-hall. It was brilliantly lighted; the table was covered with wine and fruit, and was laid for four. They waited a few minutes expecting someone to come, but as nobody did, they sat down and began to eat and drink, for they were very hungry.When they had done their supper they looked about for some place to sleep. But suddenly the door burst open, and the wizard entered the hall. He was old and hump-backed, with a bald head and a grey beard that fell to his knees. He wore a black robe, and instead of a belt three iron circlets clasped his waist. He led by the hand a lady of wonderful beauty, dressed in white, with a girdle of silver and a crown of pearls, but her face was pale and sad as death itself.The prince knew her in an instant, and moved eagerly forward; but the wizard gave him no time to speak, and said:‘I know why you are here. Very good; you may have her if for three nights following you can prevent her making her escape. If you fail in this, you and your servants will all be turned into stone, like those who have come before you.’ And offering the princess a chair, he left the hall.The prince could not take his eyes from the princess, she was so lovely! He began to talk to her, but she neither answered nor smiled, and sat as if she were made of marble. He seated himself by her, and determined not to close his eyes that night, for fear she should escape him. And in order that she should be doubly guarded, Long stretched himself like a strap all round the room, Broad took his stand by the door and puffed himself out, so that not even a mouse could slip by, and Quickeye leant against a pillar which stood in the middle of the floor and supported the roof. But in half a second they were all sound asleep, and they slept sound the whole night long.In the morning, at the first peep of dawn, the prince awoke with a start. But the princess was gone. He aroused his servants and implored them to tell him what he must do.‘Calm yourself, my lord,’ said Quickeye. ‘I have found her already. A hundred miles from here there is a forest. In the middle of the forest, an old oak, and on the top of the oak, an acorn. This acorn is the princess. If Long will take me on his shoulders, we shall soon bring her back.’ And sure enough, in less time than it takes to walk round a cottage, they had returned from the forest, and Long presented the acorn to the prince.‘Now, your excellency, throw it on the ground.’The prince obeyed, and was enchanted to see the princess appear at his side. But when the sun peeped for the first time over the mountains, the door burst open as before, and the wizard entered with a loud laugh. Suddenly he caught sight of the princess; his face darkened, he uttered a low growl, and one of the iron circlets gave way with a crash. He seized the young girl by the hand and bore her away with him.All that day the prince wandered about the castle, studying the curious treasures it contained, but everything looked as if life had suddenly come to a standstill. In one place he saw a prince who had been turned into stone in the act of brandishing a sword round which his two hands were clasped. In another, the same doom had fallen upon a knight in the act of running away. In a third, a serving man was standing eternally trying to convey a piece of beef to his mouth, and all around them were others, still preserving for evermore the attitudes they were in when the wizard had commanded ‘From henceforth be turned into marble.’ In the castle, and round the castle all was dismal and desolate. Trees there were, but without leaves; fields there were, but no grass grew on them. There was one river, but it never flowed and no fish lived in it. No flowers blossomed, and no birds sang.Three times during the day food appeared, as if by magic, for the prince and his servants. And it was not until supper was ended that the wizard appeared, as on the previous evening, and delivered the princess into the care of the prince.All four determined that this time they would keep awake at any cost. But it was no use. Off they went as they had done before, and when the prince awoke the next morning the room was again empty.With a pang of shame, he rushed to find Quickeye. ‘Awake! Awake! Quickeye! Do you know what has become of the princess?’Quickeye rubbed his eyes and answered: ‘Yes, I see her. Two hundred miles from here there is a mountain. In this mountain is a rock. In the rock, a precious stone. This stone is the princess. Long shall take me there, and we will be back before you can turn round.’So Long took him on his shoulders and they set out. At every stride they covered twenty miles, and as they drew near Quickeye fixed his burning eyes on the mountain; in an instant it split into a thousand pieces, and in one of these sparkled the precious stone. They picked it up and brought it to the prince, who flung it hastily down, and as the stone touched the floor the princess stood before him. When the wizard came, his eyes shot forth flames of fury. Cric-crac was heard, and another of his iron bands broke and fell. He seized the princess by the hand and led her off, growling louder than ever.All that day things went on exactly as they had done the day before. After supper the wizard brought back the princess, and looking him straight in the eyes he said, ‘We shall see which of us two will gain the prize after all!’That night they struggled their very hardest to keep awake, and even walked about instead of sitting down. But it was quite useless. One after another they had to give in, and for the third time the princess slipped through their fingers.When morning came, it was as usual the prince who awoke the first, and as usual, the princess being gone, he rushed to Quickeye.‘Get up, get up, Quickeye, and tell me where is the princess?’Quickeye looked about for some time without answering. ‘Oh, my lord, she is far, very far. Three hundred miles away there lies a black sea. In the middle of this sea there is a little shell, and in the middle of the shell is fixed a gold ring. That gold ring is the princess. But do not vex your soul; we will get her. Only to-day, Long must take Broad with him. He will be wanted badly.’So Long took Quickeye on one shoulder, and Broad on the other, and they set out. At each stride they left thirty miles behind them. When they reached the black sea, Quickeye showed them the spot where they must seek the shell. But though Long stretched down his hand as far as it would go, he could not find the shell, for it lay at the bottom of the sea.‘Wait a moment, comrades, it will be all right. I will help you,’ said Broad.Then he swelled himself out so that you would have thought the world could hardly have held him, and stooping down he drank. He drank so much at every mouthful, that only a minute or so passed before the water had sunk enough for Long to put his hand to the bottom. He soon found the shell, and pulled the ring out. But time had been lost, and Long had a double burden to carry. The dawn was breaking fast before they got back to the castle, where the prince was waiting for them in an agony of fear.Soon the first rays of the sun were seen peeping over the tops of the mountains. The door burst open, and finding the prince standing alone the wizard broke into peals of wicked laughter. But as he laughed a loud crash was heard, the window fell into a thousand pieces, a gold ring glittered in the air, and the princess stood before the enchanter. For Quickeye, who was watching from afar, had told Long of the terrible danger now threatening the prince, and Long, summoning all his strength for one gigantic effort, had thrown the ring right through the window.“There was a great black crow in the room with them.” Illustration by Katharine Pyle. Published in Wonder Tales from Many Lands by Katharine Pyle (1920), George G. Harrap & Company.The wizard shrieked and howled with rage, till the whole castle trembled to its foundations. Then a crash was heard, the third band split in two, and a crow flew out of the window.Then the princess at length broke the enchanted silence, and blushing like a rose, gave the prince her thanks for her unlooked-for deliverance.But it was not only the princess who was restored to life by the flight of the wicked black crow. The marble figures became men once more, and took up their occupations just as they had left them off. The horses neighed in the stables, the flowers blossomed in the garden, the birds flew in the air, the fish darted in the water. Everywhere you looked, all was life, all was joy!And the knights who had been turned into stone came in a body to offer their homage to the prince who had set them free.‘Do not thank me,’ he said, ‘for I have done nothing. Without my faithful servants, Long, Broad, and Quickeye, I should even have been as one of you.’With these words he bade them farewell, and departed with the princess and his faithful companions for the kingdom of his father.The old king, who had long since given up all hope, wept for joy at the sight of his son, and insisted that the wedding should take place as soon as possible.All the knights who had been enchanted in the Iron Castle were invited to the ceremony, and after it had taken place, Long, Broad, and Quickeye took leave of the young couple, saying that they were going to look for more work.The prince offered them all their hearts could desire if they would only remain with him, but they replied that an idle life would not please them, and that they could never be happy unless they were busy, so they went away to seek their fortunes, and for all I know are seeking still.","['upon', 'time', 'woman', 'bake', 'five', 'come', 'oven', 'overbaked', 'crust', 'hard', 'daughter',

1917,slavic,Beauty and the Horns - The Story of an Enchanted Maiden,"There was once a rich man who when he was dying called his son to his bedside and said:“Danilo, my son, I am leaving you my riches. The only thing I ask of you is this: close your ears to all reports of an enchanted maiden who is known as Peerless Beauty and when the time comes that you wish to marry choose for wife some quiet sensible girl of your native village.”Now if the father had not mentioned Peerless Beauty all might have been well. Danilo might never have heard of her and after a time he would probably have fallen in love with a girl of his native village and married her. As it was, after his father’s death he kept saying to himself:“Peerless Beauty, the enchanted maiden of whom my father warned me! I wonder is she really as beautiful as all that! I wonder where she lives!”He thought about her until he could think of nothing else.“Peerless Beauty! Peerless Beauty! Oh, I must see this enchanted maiden even if it costs me my life!”His father had a brother, a wise old man, who was supposed to know everything in the world.“I will go to my uncle,” the young man said. “Perhaps he will tell me where I can find Peerless Beauty.”So he went to his uncle and said:“My dear uncle, my father as he lay dying told me about a wonderful maiden called Peerless Beauty. Can you tell me where she lives because I want to see her for myself and judge whether she is as beautiful as my father said.”His uncle looked at him gravely and shook his head.“My poor boy, how can I tell you where that enchanted maiden lives when I know it would mean death to you if ever you saw her? Think no more about her but go, find some suitable maid in the village, and marry her like a sensible young man.”But his uncle’s words, far from dissuading Danilo, only excited him the more.“If my uncle knows where Peerless Beauty lives,” he thought, “other men also know.”So one by one he went to all the old men in the village and asked them what they knew of Peerless Beauty. One by one they shook their heads and told him that Peerless Beauty was no maiden for him to be thinking about.“Put her out of your mind,” they said. “These enchanted maidens are a snare to young men. What you want to do is marry some quiet industrious girl here in the village and settle down like a sensible young man.”But the oftener Danilo heard this advice, the more firmly convinced he became that it was just what he did not want to do.“Time enough to settle down after I’ve seen Peerless Beauty,” he told himself. “She must be beautiful indeed, or all these old men would not be so anxious to keep me from seeing her. Well, if they won’t tell me where she is, I’ll go out in the world and find her for myself.”So he put on rich clothes as befitted his wealth, took a bag of the gold his father had left him, mounted his horse, and rode off into the world. Everywhere he went he made inquiries about Peerless Beauty and everywhere he found old men who knew about the enchanted maiden but would tell him nothing. Every one of them advised him to go home like a sensible young man and think no more about her. But all they said only made him the more determined to see the maiden for himself.Finally one day as evening approached he came to a little hut in the woods. At the door of the hut sat a poor old woman. She held out her hand as he passed and begged an alms. Danilo, being a kind hearted young man, gave her a gold piece.“May God reward you!” the old woman said.“Granny,” Danilo asked, “can you tell me the way to Peerless Beauty?”“Aye, my son, that I can but he is a rash youth who seeks that maiden! It were better for you to turn back than to go on!”“But I’m not going to turn back!” Danilo declared. “Whatever the outcome I’m going to find Peerless Beauty and see for myself why all men fear her.”When the old woman saw that Danilo was determined, she gave up pleading with him and pointed out a faint trail in the forest which, she told him, would lead him to Peerless Beauty’s castle.He slept that night in the old woman’s hut and early next morning set out on the forest trail. By afternoon he reached the castle.“What do you want?” the guards demanded roughly.“I want to see Peerless Beauty.”“Have you gold?” they asked him.Danilo showed them his bag of ducats.They led him into a hall of the castle and told him to put his gold on a table. If he did so, perhaps Peerless Beauty would show herself and perhaps she wouldn’t.Danilo did as the guards directed and then faced a curtain behind which, they told him, Peerless Beauty was seated. The curtain opened a little, but instead of showing her face Peerless Beauty extended only one finger. However, that finger was so ravishingly beautiful that Danilo almost fainted with delight. He would have stayed gazing on that one enchanting finger for hours if the guards had not taken him roughly by the shoulders and thrown him out of the castle.“Come again when you’ve got more gold!” they shouted after him.Like a man in a dream Danilo rode back to the old woman’s hut.“Now, my son, are you satisfied?” she asked him. “Are you ready now to go home and settle down like a sensible young man?”“Oh, granny!” Danilo raved. “Such a finger! I must see that finger again if it cost me my whole fortune!”He slept that night in the old woman’s hut and the next day returned to his native village. There he got another bag of the golden ducats which his father had left him and at once started back to the castle of Peerless Beauty.This time that heartless maiden stripped him again of his gold, showed him two of her enchanting fingers, and as before had her guards throw him out of the castle.“Come again when you’ve got more gold!” they shouted after him.That’s exactly what the poor young man did. He went back and back until the fortune that his father had left him was entirely squandered. And all he had seen of Peerless Beauty up to that time were the fingers of one hand! Shouldn’t you suppose that now with all his wealth lost he would get over his foolish infatuation? Well, he didn’t.“I must go back again!” he kept telling himself.His gold was gone but he still had his father’s house. It was a big old house with garrets and cellars.“Perhaps if I hunt I shall find some treasures hidden away in odd corners,” Danilo said.So he hunted upstairs and down. He opened old boxes and rummaged about among the dark rafters. One day he came upon a funny looking little cap.“I wonder whose this was,” he thought to himself.He went to a mirror and tried the cap on. Then a strange thing happened. The moment the cap touched his head, Danilo disappeared.“Ah!” he cried, “it’s a magic cap and the moment I put it on I become invisible! Now I can slip into Peerless Beauty’s chamber and see her lovely face!”With his magic cap pulled tightly down over his forehead, he set off once more for Peerless Beauty’s castle. Sure enough he was able to pass unseen the guards at the gate, he was able to go boldly into the great hall, and beyond it through the curtain into Peerless Beauty’s own chamber.The Beauty was seated with her back to the curtain and a serving maid was combing out her hair for the night. It was lovely hair and it fell down over Beauty’s shoulders like a mantle of gold. At mere sight of it Danilo was so overcome with emotion that he sighed.“What’s that?” Beauty cried. “There’s some one in my chamber!”The serving maid looked under the bed and behind the chairs and in the corners.“There’s no one here, my lady.”“That’s strange!” Beauty said. “I feel as though some one were looking at me.”When Danilo saw the actual face of the enchanted maiden, it was all he could do to keep from crying aloud. She was so unutterably beautiful that he almost swooned away in ecstacy.Presently the maiden went to bed and fell into an uneasy sleep. The light of a single candle shed a faint radiance over her face making it lovelier than ever. Through all the long hours of night Danilo stood perfectly still, gazing at her, afraid almost to breathe lest he should disturb her.“Unless I win her for wife,” he thought to himself, “I shall nevermore be happy!”When morning came the maiden awoke with a start and said:“There’s some one looking at me! Who is it? Who is it?”“It’s only your poor Danilo,” a voice answered.“Danilo? Who is Danilo?”“The youth whom you have been treating so cruelly. But though you have treated me cruelly, I love you still!”“If you love me still,” the maiden said, “let me see you.”Danilo took off the magic cap and there he stood, a handsome youth, at the foot of her bed. Then the crafty maiden spoke him fair and Danilo told her about the magic cap, and when she said to him that she repented having treated him so cruelly and asked him to let her see the cap, the poor young man was so dazzled by her beauty and her seeming kindness that he handed it to her at once.Instantly she clapped it on her head and disappeared. Then she laughed in derision and called out loudly to the guards:“Ho, there! Take out this young man and drive him forth! Let him return when he has another treasure to offer me!”So the guards dragged Danilo out and drove him away.With no more gold, with no more magic cap, Danilo returned to his father’s house.“Perhaps there are other treasures hidden away,” he thought. “I’ll search further.”In his search he came upon an old pitcher and thinking it might be silver he began rubbing it. Instantly there was a clap of thunder and a company of soldiers appeared. Their captain saluted Danilo respectfully and said:“We are the servants of that magic pitcher. What does our master wish?”“Magic pitcher?” stammered Danilo. “And am I your master?”“Yes,” said the captain, “you are our master as long as you hold the magic pitcher in your hands.”“You may disappear now,” Danilo said. “I will rub the pitcher when I need you.”Delighted with this unexpected good fortune, he hurried off to the woods to the hut of the old woman who had befriended him before. He showed her the pitcher and demonstrated for her how it worked. Then he asked her to carry a message to Peerless Beauty.“Tell her,” he said, “that unless she consents to marry me at once I’ll lead a mighty army against her, take her captive, and then send her off in exile to that howling wilderness which people call the Donkeys’ Paradise.”“I will deliver your message,” the old woman said, “on condition that you promise me to be on your guard this time. Don’t let the maiden trick you again. She is under an enchantment that makes her cruel and crafty and the enchantment will never be broken until she meets a man upon whom her wiles have no effect.”“Trust me this time,” Danilo said. “I’ve had my lesson.”So the old woman delivered the message and when Peerless Beauty received it with scorn, Danilo at once set out for the castle with the magic pitcher in his hand. He began rubbing and every time he rubbed a company of soldiers appeared. Soon the castle was surrounded by a great army and in fright and dismay Peerless Beauty sent out word that she was ready to make an unconditional surrender.When Danilo entered the castle he found her humble and meek.“I have treated you cruelly,” she said. “Now I am in your power, do with me what you will.” And she began weeping softly until the sight of her tears drove Danilo distracted.“Weep no more, dear lady!” he cried. “You have nothing to fear from me! I love you! I am your slave!”The Peerless one slowly dried her tears.“If you love me as you say you do, you will tell me by what magic you have raised this great army.”Then Danilo, forgetting the old woman’s warning, took the magic pitcher out of his shirt and showed the maiden how it worked.“Ah!” she murmured wonderingly. “It looks like any old pitcher! Please, Danilo, let me see it in my own hands.”Danilo handed her the pitcher and, quick as a flash, she rubbed it. There was a clap of thunder, a company of soldiers appeared, and their captain saluting her respectfully said:“What does the mistress of the pitcher want?”“Nay!” cried Danilo, “it is I who own the pitcher, not she!”“We are the servants,” the captain said, “of whoever holds the pitcher.”At that Peerless Beauty laughed loud and scornfully until the castle rang with her merriment.“Seize that wretch!” she said, pointing to Danilo. “Tie his hands and drive him out in exile to the Donkeys’ Paradise! Let him stay there until he has another treasure to present me!”So they drove Danilo out to the wilderness and left him there.He wandered about for many days hungry and thirsty, subsisting on roots and berries, and having for drink only the water that collected in the hoof prints of the wild beasts.“See what I’ve come to!” he cried aloud. “Why didn’t I heed the old woman’s warning! If I had, I should have broken the evil enchantment that binds my Peerless Beauty and all would have been well!”One day as he wandered about he came upon a vine that was laden with great clusters of luscious red grapes. He fell upon them ravenously and ate bunch after bunch. Suddenly he felt something in his hair and lifting his hands he found that horns had grown out all over his head.“Fine grapes these are!” he exclaimed, “to bring out horns on a person’s head!”However, he was so hungry that he kept on eating until his head was one mass of horns.The next day he found a vine that had clusters of white grapes. He began eating the white grapes and he hadn’t finished a bunch before the horns all fell off his head.“Ha!” he said. “The red grapes put horns on and the white grapes take them off! That’s a trick worth knowing!”He took some reeds and fashioned two baskets one of which he filled with red grapes and the other with white grapes. Then staining his face with the dark juice of a leaf until he looked brown and sunburned like a countryman, he went back to Peerless Beauty’s castle. There he marched up and down below the Peerless one’s window crying his wares like a huckster:“Sweet grapes for sale! Who wants my fresh sweet grapes!”Now it was not the season for grapes, so Peerless Beauty when she heard the cry was surprised and said to her serving maid:“Go quickly and buy me some grapes from that huckster and mind you don’t eat one yourself!”The serving maid hurried out to Danilo and he sold her some of the red grapes. As she carried them in, she couldn’t resist the temptation of slipping a few into her mouth. Instantly some horns grew out on her head.“That’s to punish me for disobeying my mistress!” the poor girl cried. “Oh, dear, what shall I do?”She was afraid to show herself to Peerless Beauty, so she pretended she was taken sick and she went to bed and pulled the sheet over her head and sent in the grapes by another serving maid.Peerless Beauty ate them all before she discovered their frightful property. Then there was a great to-do, and cries of anger and of fright, and a quick sending out of the guards to find the huckster. But the huckster had disappeared.What could Peerless Beauty do now? She tried to pull the horns out but they wouldn’t come. She tried to cut them off but they resisted the edge of the sharpest knife. She was too proud to show herself with horns, so she swathed her head with jewels and ribbons and pretended she was wearing an elaborate head-dress.Then she sent heralds through the land offering a huge reward to any one who could cure her serving maid of some strange horns that had grown out on her head. You see she thought if she could get hold of some one who would cure the maid, then she could make him cure her, too.Well, doctors and quacks and all sorts of people came and tried every kind of remedy, but all in vain. The horns stayed firmly rooted.A whole week went by and when the last of the quacks had come and gone, Danilo, disguised as an old physician, presented himself and craved audience with the Peerless one. He carried two small jars in his hands one of which was filled with a conserve made from the white grapes and the other with a conserve made from the red grapes.Peerless Beauty, her horns swathed in silk and gleaming with jewels, received him coldly.“Are you one more quack?” she asked.“Not a quack,” he said, bowing low, “but a man who has happened upon a strange secret of nature. I can cure your serving maid of her horns provided she confess to me all her misdeeds and hand over to me anything she has that does not belong to her.”Peerless Beauty had him shown to the room where the serving maid lay in bed. The poor frightened girl at once confessed that she had stolen a few of her mistress’s grapes and eaten them. Danilo spoke kindly to her, gave her some of the white grape conserve, and as soon as she had tasted it the horns of course dropped off.Thereupon Peerless Beauty led Danilo to her own chamber, ordered all her people out, and then acknowledged that she, too, was suffering from horns.“I am sure I can cure you,” Danilo told her, “provided you confess to me all your misdeeds and hand over to me whatever you have that belongs to some one else.”“I cheated a foolish young man out of five bags of gold,” Peerless Beauty said. “Here they are in this chest. Take them.”Danilo opened the chest and took out his own five bags of gold.“Is that all?” he asked.“Yes, that is all.”Danilo gave her some of the red grape conserve and of course, instead of the horns already on her head falling off, more grew on.“You’re not telling me the truth,” Danilo said, “and I can’t cure you. There’s no use my treating you further.”He turned to go and Peerless Beauty, in great fright, begged him to stay.“I do remember another misdeed,” she confessed. “I took by trickery a magic pitcher from the same foolish young man.”She gave Danilo the pitcher and he hid it in his shirt.“Is that all?”“Yes, that is all.”Danilo gave her some more of the red grape conserve and, of course, more horns grew out on her head. Then he pretended to get angry.“How can you expect to be cured when you don’t tell me the truth? I told you I could not cure you unless you confessed all!”Peerless Beauty wanted much to keep the magic cap but when the strange physician thundered and scowled and threatened again to leave her, more horned than ever, she acknowledged that she had taken the cap, too, and handed it over.This time Danilo gave her some of the white grape conserve and as soon as she had eaten it all the horns fell off and her head shimmered and shone as of old with her beautiful hair.Then Danilo told her who he was and at once the maiden sought to ensnare him again with her wiles.“What a wonderful man you are, Danilo! I could love you now if you loved me, but I know of course that you will never love me again after the cruel way I have treated you!”“But I do love you!” Danilo cried. “I do love you!”“No, you don’t!” she said, and she pretended to weep. “If you did love me, you’d tell me where you found those red grapes and what this magic conserve is made of. But of course you don’t love me enough to tell me.”Because she looked more beautiful than ever with the tears on her lovely cheeks, Danilo was about to tell her what she wanted to know when he remembered the old woman’s warning. That was enough. He hardened his heart and declared:“No! I’ll never tell you! Do you hear me: I’ll never tell you!”She wept and implored him and used all her wiles, but Danilo remembering the past was firm. And presently he had the reward that a man always has when he’s firm, for as soon as it was evident that she could no longer befool him, the evil enchantment that bound her broke with a snap and Peerless Beauty became a human maiden as gentle and sweet and loving as she was beautiful.She knelt at Danilo’s feet and humbly begged his pardon and promised, if he would still marry her, to make him the most dutiful wife in the world.So Danilo married Peerless Beauty and with the servants of the magic pitcher transported her and her castle and her riches together with the old woman who had befriended them both to his own native village. There he still lives happy and prosperous.His uncle and all the old men in the village take credit to themselves for the success of his adventures.“It is due entirely to us,” they tell any one who will listen to them, “that Danilo went out in search of Peerless Beauty in the first place. When he came to us and asked our advice we said to him: ‘Go, by all means! You’re young and brave and of course you’ll win her!’ If we hadn’t urged him to go, he would probably have settled down here at home, married some quiet village girl, and never be heard of again!”That’s how the old men talk now, but we know what they really did say at the time!Yet after all that doesn’t matter. All that matters is that Danilo and Peerless Beauty love each other and are happy.","['piece', 'luck', 'farmer', 'good', 'something', 'hasten', 'step', 'another', 'good', 'politely', 'bunniah',

1990,slavic,The Best Wish - The Story of Three Brothers and an Angel,"There were once three brothers whose only possession was a pear tree. They took turns guarding it. That is to say while two of them went to work the third stayed at home to see that no harm came to the pear tree.Now it happened that an Angel from heaven was sent down to test the hearts of the three brothers. The Angel took the form of a beggar and approaching the pear tree on a day when the oldest brother was guarding it, he held out his hand and said:“In heaven’s name, brother, give me a ripe pear.”The oldest brother at once handed him a pear, saying:“This one I can give you because it is mine, but none of the others because they belong to my brothers.”The Angel thanked him and departed.The next day when the second brother was on guard he returned in the same guise and again begged the charity of a ripe pear.“Take this one,” the second brother said. “It is mine and I can give it away. I can’t give away any of the others because they belong to my brothers.”The Angel thanked the second brother and departed.The third day he had exactly the same experience with the youngest brother.On the following day the Angel, in the guise of a monk, came to the brothers’ house very early while they were still all at home.“My sons,” he said, “come with me and perhaps I can find you something better to do than guard a single pear tree.”The brothers agreed and they all started out together. After walking some time they came to the banks of a broad deep river.“My son,” the Angel said, addressing the oldest brother, “if I were to grant you one wish, what you ask?”“I’d be happy,” the oldest brother said, “if all this water was turned into wine and belonged to me.”The Angel lifted his staff and made the sign of the cross and lo! the water became wine from great wine-presses. At once numbers of casks appeared and men filling them and rolling them about. A huge industry sprang up with sheds and storehouses and wagons and men running hither and thither and addressing the oldest brother respectfully as “Master!”“You have your wish,” the Angel said. “See that you do not forget God’s poor now that you are rich. Farewell.”So they left the oldest brother in the midst of his wine and went on farther until they came to a broad field where flocks of pigeons were feeding.“If I were to grant you one wish,” the Angel said to the second brother, “what would you ask?”“I’d be happy, father, if all the pigeons in this field were turned to sheep and belonged to me.”The Angel lifted his staff, made the sign of the cross, and lo! the field was covered with sheep. Sheds appeared and houses and women, some of them milking the ewes and others skimming the milk and making cheeses. In one place men were busy preparing meat for the market and in another cleaning wool. And all of them as they came and went spoke respectfully to the second brother and called him, “Master!”“You have your wish,” the Angel said. “Stay here and enjoy prosperity and see that you do not forget God’s poor!”Then he and the youngest brother went on their way.“Now, my son,” the Angel said, “you, too, may make one wish.”“I want but one thing, father. I pray heaven to grant me a truly pious wife. That is my only wish.”“A truly pious wife!” the Angel cried. “My boy, you have asked the hardest thing of all! Why, there are only three truly pious women in all the world! Two of them are already married and the third is a princess who is being sought in marriage at this very moment by two kings! However, your brothers have received their wishes and you must have yours, too. Let us go at once to the father of this virtuous princess and present your suit.”So just as they were they trudged to the city where the princess lived and presented themselves at the palace looking shabby and travel-stained.The king received them and when he heard their mission he looked at them in amazement.“This makes three suitors for my daughter’s hand! Two kings and now this young man all on the same day! How am I going to decide among them?”“Let heaven decide!” the Angel said. “Cut three branches of grape-vine and let the princess mark each branch with the name of a different suitor. Then let her plant the three branches to-night in the garden and to-morrow do you give her in marriage to the man whose branch has blossomed during the night and by morning is covered with ripe clusters of grapes.”The king and the two other suitors agreed to this and the princess named and planted three branches of grape-vine. In the morning two of the branches were bare and dry, but the third, the one which was marked with the name of the youngest brother, was covered with green leaves and ripe clusters of grapes. The king accepted heaven’s ruling and at once led his daughter to church where he had her married to the stranger and sent her off with his blessing.The Angel led the young couple to a forest and left them there.A year went by and the Angel was sent back to earth to see how the three brothers were faring. Assuming the form of an old beggar, he went to the oldest brother who was busy among his wine-presses and begged the charity of a cup of wine.“Be off with you, you old vagabond!” the oldest brother shouted angrily. “If I gave a cup of wine to every beggar that comes along I’d soon be a beggar myself!”The Angel lifted his staff, made the sign of the cross, and lo! the wine and all the wine-presses disappeared and in their place flowed a broad deep river.“In your prosperity you have forgotten God’s poor,” the Angel said. “Go back to your pear tree.”Then the Angel went to the second brother who was busy in his dairy.“Brother,” the Angel said, “in heaven’s name, I pray you, give me a morsel of cheese.”“A morsel of cheese, you lazy good-for-nothing!” the second brother cried. “Be off with you or I’ll call the dogs!”The Angel lifted his staff, made the sign of the cross, and lo! the sheep and the dairy and all the busy laborers disappeared and he and the second brother were standing there alone in a field where flocks of pigeons were feeding.“In your prosperity you have forgotten God’s poor,” the Angel said. “Go back to your pear tree!”Then the Angel made his way to the forest where he had left the youngest brother and his wife. He found them in great poverty living in a mean little hut.“God be with you!” said the Angel still in the guise of an old beggar. “I pray you in heaven’s name give me shelter for the night and a bite of supper.”“We are poor ourselves,” the youngest brother said.“But come in, you are welcome to share what we have.”They put the old beggar to rest at the most comfortable place beside the fire and the wife set three places for the evening meal. They were so poor that the loaf that was baking in the oven was not made of grain ground at the mill but of pounded bark gathered from the trees.“Alas,” the wife murmured to herself, “it shames me that we have no real bread to put before our guest.”Imagine then her surprise when she opened the oven and saw a browned loaf of wheaten bread.“God be praised!” she cried.She drew a pitcher of water at the spring but when she began pouring it into the cups she found to her joy that it was changed to wine.“In your happiness,” the Angel said, “you have not forgotten God’s poor and God will reward you!”He raised his staff, made the sign of the cross, and lo! the mean little hut disappeared and in its place arose a stately palace full of riches and beautiful things. Servants passed hither and thither and addressed the poor man respectfully as “My lord!” and his wife as “My lady!”The old beggar arose and as he went he blessed them both, saying:“God gives you these riches and they will be yours to enjoy so long as you share them with others.”They must have remembered the Angel’s words for all their lives long they were happy and prosperous.","['spain',

2046,slavic,"The Enchanted Peafowl - The Story of the Golden Apples, the Wicked Dragon, and the Magic Horse","Have you ever heard the story of the Peafowl who became a Queen and of the Tsar’s Youngest Son who married her? Well, here it is:There was once a Tsar who took great delight in his garden. Every morning you could see him bending over his flowers or picking the fruit of his favorite tree. This was an apple-tree that had the magic property of bearing buds, blossoms, and golden fruit every twenty-four hours. It was known as the golden apple-tree. In the morning the first thing when he woke up the Tsar would look out his bedroom window to see that all was well with his beloved tree.One morning when as usual he looked out he was grieved to see that the tree had been stripped of all the golden fruit which had ripened during the night.“Who has stolen my golden apples?” he cried.The palace guards looked everywhere for some trace of the thief but found nothing.The next morning the same thing had happened and every morning thereafter when the Tsar looked out of his bedroom window he saw that the tree had again been stripped of its golden fruit.He called his three sons to him and said:“Is it seemly that a Tsar who has three able-bodied sons should be robbed night after night of his golden apples? Are you willing that this should happen and you do nothing about it?”The eldest son who was a braggart said:“My father, you need say no more. I myself will watch to-night and when the thief appears I will overpower him and bring him to you.”So the eldest son watched that night, standing on guard under the apple-tree and leaning against its trunk.As midnight approached his eyes grew heavy and he fell asleep. While he slept the golden apples ripened and were stolen and the next morning, as usual, the branches were bare.The second son who was a crafty youth laughed at his brother and said:“To-night I will watch. I will pretend to be asleep and when the thief appears I will jump upon him and overpower him.”So when night came the second son went on guard under the tree and in order to deceive the thief he lay down on the ground and closed his eyes. At first he stayed wide awake but as the hours dragged by he grew tired and then, because he was in such a comfortable position, he too fell soundly asleep. Midnight came and the apples ripened but the next morning, when the second prince awoke, the tree had again been stripped of its golden fruit.The Tsar’s Youngest Son now said:“Father, let me go on guard to-night.”His brothers jeered and the Tsar shook his head.“Nay, nay, my boy, why should you succeed where your older brothers have failed? It is God’s will that my golden apples should be stolen and I must submit.”But the Youngest Son insisted that he, too, be given a chance to capture the thief and at last the Tsar consented.“I will sleep soundly the first part of the night,” the Youngest Prince thought to himself, “and with God’s help wake up at midnight.”As soon as it was dark he had his bed carried outdoors and placed under the apple-tree. Then after commending his undertaking to God he lay down and fell soundly to sleep. Just before midnight he awoke. The apples had ripened and were shining among the leaves like golden lanterns.On the stroke of midnight there was a whirr of wings and nine beautiful peafowl came flying down from the sky. Eight of them settled on the branches of the apple-tree and began eating the golden fruit. The ninth alighted beside the Young Prince and as she touched the ground changed into a lovely maiden.She was so beautiful and gentle that the Young Prince fell madly in love with her and at once began wooing her with kisses and caresses. She responded to his love and they spent the night together in great happiness.At the first streak of dawn she jumped up, saying:“My dear one, I must leave you now!”“But you will come again, won’t you?” the Prince asked.“Yes,” she promised him. “To-night.”Suddenly the Prince remembered the golden apples. The peafowl in the tree were about to eat the last of them.“Can’t you make them leave just one apple for my father?” the Prince begged.The maiden spoke to the birds and they flew down with two of the golden apples, one for the Tsar and one for the Prince himself.Then the maiden lifted her arms above her head, changed into a peafowl, and with the other eight flew off into the morning sky.The Prince carried the two apples to his father and the Tsar was so delighted that he forgot to ask the Prince the particulars of his adventure.The next night the Prince again slept under the apple-tree and awoke just before midnight to hear the whirr of wings and see the nine peafowl come flying down from the sky. Eight of them settled on the branches of the apple-tree and the ninth, as before, alighted beside him and as she touched the earth changed into the lovely maiden of his heart. Again they passed the night together in great happiness and in the early dawn before she flew away the maiden gave him the last two of the golden apples.This went on night after night until the Prince’s two elder brothers were mad with jealousy and consumed with curiosity to know what happened every night under the apple-tree. At last they went to an evil old woman and bribed her to spy on the Young Prince.“Find out what happens every night at the apple-tree,” they told her, “and we will reward you richly.”So the evil old woman hid herself near the apple-tree and that night when the prince fell asleep she crept under his bed. Midnight came and she heard the whirr of wings and presently she saw the white feet of a lovely maiden touch the ground and she heard the prince say: “My love, is it you?”Then as the Prince and the maiden began kissing each other and exchanging vows of love very slowly and cautiously she reached up her hand from under the bed and groped around until she felt the maiden’s hair. Then with a scissors she snipped off a lock.“Oh!” the maiden cried in terror. She jumped up, lifted her arms above her head, changed into a peafowl, and without another word flew off with the other eight and vanished in the sky.In a fury the Prince searched about to see what had frightened his loved one. He found the old woman under the bed and dragging her out by the hair he struck her dead with his sword. And good riddance it was, too, for she was an evil old thing and only caused mischief in the world.But putting the evil old woman out of the way did not, alas, bring back the lovely maiden. The Prince waited for her the next night and the next and many following nights but she nevermore returned.The magic apple-tree of course was no longer robbed of its golden fruit, so the Tsar was happy once again and never tired of praising the valor of his youngest son. But as for the prince, in spite of his father’s praise he grew sadder and sadder.Finally he went to the Tsar and said:“Father, I have lost the maiden whom I love and life without her is not worth the living. Unless I go out in the world and find her I shall die.”The Tsar tried to dissuade him but when he could not he mounted him on a fine horse, gave him a serving man to accompany him, and sent him off with his blessing.The Prince and his man wandered hither and thither over the world inquiring everywhere for news of nine peafowl one of whom was a lovely maiden. They came at last to a lake on the shore of which lived an ugly old woman with an only daughter.“Nine peafowl,” she repeated, “and one of them a lovely maiden! You must mean the nine sisters, the enchanted princesses, who fly about as peafowl. They come here every morning to bathe in the lake. What can you want with them?”The Prince told the old woman that one of them was his love and that unless he married her he would die.“Die, indeed!” scoffed the old woman. “That’s no way for a handsome young man to talk! I’ll tell you what you ought to do: give up thought of this peafowl princess and marry my daughter. Then I’ll make you heir to all my riches.”She called out her daughter who was as ugly as herself and cross and ill-natured in the bargain. Just one look at her and the Prince said firmly:“No! If I can’t marry my own dear love I won’t marry any one!”“Very well!” said the old woman shortly.When the Prince’s back was turned she called the serving man aside and whispered:“Will you do what I tell you if I pay you well?”The serving man who was a mean greedy fellow nodded his head and the old woman handed him a small bellows.“Hide this in your shirt,” she told him, “and don’t let your master see it. Then to-morrow morning when you go down to the lake with him to see the nine peafowl slip it out and blow it on the back of his neck. Do this and I’ll give you a golden ducat.”The serving man took the bellows and did as the old woman directed. The next morning down at the lake just as the nine peafowl came flying into sight he crept up behind the Prince and blew the bellows on the back of his neck. Instantly sleep overcame the Prince. His eyes closed, his head drooped, and the reins fell from his hands.Eight of the peafowl alighted on the water’s edge, changed into lovely maidens and went bathing in the lake, but the ninth flew straight down to the Prince, fluttered her wings in his face and uttering sad cries tried hard to arouse him.The eight finished their baths, changed back into birds, and calling their sister they all flew off together. Then and not till then did the Prince awaken.“Ah!” he cried, “how could I have fallen asleep just when the peafowl appeared? Where are they now? Are they gone?”“Yes,” his man told him, “they’re gone. Eight of them changed into lovely maidens and went bathing in the lake but the ninth fluttered about your head and tried in every way to arouse you. I tried to arouse you, too, but you kept on sleeping.”“Strange!” thought the Prince. “How could I have fallen asleep at such a time? I’ll have to try again to-morrow morning.”The next morning the same thing happened. The treacherous serving man again blew the bellows on the back of the Prince’s neck and instantly the Prince sank into a deep sleep from which the ninth peafowl was unable to arouse him.As she rose to join her sisters she said to the serving man:“When your master awakens tell him that to-morrow is the last day we shall come here to bathe in the lake.”The peafowl were no sooner gone than the Prince rubbed his eyes and looked about.“What! Where are they? Have I been asleep again?”The serving man pretended to be deeply grieved.“I tried hard to awaken you, master, but I couldn’t. The ninth peafowl as she flew away said to tell you that to-morrow is the last day they’ll come to the lake.”The next day as the Prince waited for the appearance of the nine peafowl he galloped madly along the shore of the lake hoping in this way to ward off the strange sleep. But the moment the nine peafowl appeared in the sky he was so delighted that he drew rein and the treacherous serving man was able to slip up behind him and blow the magic bellows on his neck. So again he slept soundly while the ninth peafowl fluttered about his head and tried vainly to arouse him.As she was flying away she said to the serving man:“Tell your master that now he will never find me unless he strikes off the head from the nail.”When the Prince awoke the serving man delivered this message.“What can she mean?” the Prince said.He looked hard at the serving man and something in the fellow’s appearance made him suspect treachery.“You know more than you’re telling me!” the Prince cried, and taking the cowardly fellow by the throat he shook him and choked him until he had got the truth out of him.“Ha!” cried the Prince. “Now I understand! You are the nail of which my dear love warns me!”The fellow whined and begged for mercy but the Prince with one blow of his sword struck off his head. Then, leaving the body where it fell for the old woman to bury, he mounted his horse and again set forth on his quest.Everywhere he went he made inquiries about the nine enchanted peafowl and everywhere people shook their heads and said they had never heard of them. At last high up in a wild mountain he found an old hermit who knew all about them.“Ah,” he said, “you mean the nine princesses. Eight of them have broken the enchantment that held them and are now happily married. The ninth awaits you. She is living in the royal palace of a beautiful city that lies three days’ journey to the north of this mountain. When you find her, if you do just as she says she, too, will soon be free of all enchantment. Then she will be made queen.”The Prince thanked the hermit and rode on. After three days he came to the city of which the hermit had told him. He made his way to the palace and into the Princess’s presence. Sure enough the Princess was his own dear love. She received him with joy, promised soon to marry him, and gave over to him the keys of the palace.“You shall now be master here,” she told him, “to go where you like and do as you like. There is only one thing that you must not do, only one place where you must not go. Under the palace are twelve cellars. Here are the keys to them all. Go into eleven of them whenever you will but you must never open the door of the twelfth one. If you do a heavy misfortune may fall upon both of us.”One day while the Princess was walking in the garden, the young Prince thought he would go through the cellars. So, taking the keys, he unlocked the cellars one after another until he had seen eleven of them. Then he stood before the door of the twelfth wondering why the Princess had warned him not to open it.“I’ll open it just a little,” he thought to himself. “If there’s something inside that tries to get out, I’ll close it quickly.”So he took the twelfth key, unlocked the twelfth door, and peeped inside the twelfth cellar. It was empty except for one huge cask with an open bunghole.“I don’t see anything in here to be afraid of,” he said.Just then he heard a groan from inside the cask and a voice called out in a begging, whining tone:“A cup of water, brother! A cup of water! I am dying of thirst!”Now the Prince thought to himself that it was a terrible thing for any living creature to be dying of thirst. So he hurried out, got a cup of water, and poured it into the open bunghole. Instantly one of the three iron hoops that bound the cask burst asunder and the voice inside the cask said:“Thank you, brother! Thank you! Now give me another cup! I am dying of thirst!”So the Prince poured in a second cup and the second iron hoop snapped apart and when the voice still begged for more water he poured in a third cup. The third hoop broke, the staves of the cask fell in, and a horrid dragon sprang out. Before the Prince could move, he had flown through the door of the twelfth cellar into the eleventh cellar, then into the tenth cellar, the ninth cellar, the eight cellar, the seventh cellar, the sixth, the fifth, the fourth, the third, the second, the first, and so out into the garden. The Prince reached the garden just in time to see the monster overpower the Princess.“Alas, my dear one, what have you done?” cried the poor Princess as the dragon carried her off. “The enchantment would soon have been broken and I could have married you if only you had not gone into the twelfth cellar!”Heartbroken at what had happened, the Prince mounted his horse and started off in pursuit of the dragon.“I must do what I can to rescue my loved one,” he said, “even if it costs me my life.”He rode many days until he came to the castle of the dragon. The dragon was out and the Princess received him with tears of joy.“Come,” he said to her, “let us escape before the dragon returns.”The Princess sighed and shook her head.“How, my loved one, can we escape? The dragon rides a magic horse and however fast we go he will be able to overtake us.”But the Prince insisted that they make the attempt. So she mounted with him and off they went.When the dragon arrived home and found her gone, he laughed a brutal laugh and said to his horse:“I suppose that foolish young Prince has been here and is trying to carry her off. Shall we start after them now or wait till we’ve had our supper?”“We might as well eat,” the horse said, “for we’ll overtake them anyway.”So they both ate and then the dragon mounted the magic horse and in no time at all they had overtaken the fugitives.“I ought to tear you to pieces,” the dragon said to the Prince, “but I won’t this time because you gave me a cup of water. However, I warn you not to try this foolishness again!”With that he clutched the poor weeping Princess in his scaly arms and carried her back to the castle.What was the Prince to do now? He tried to plan some other way of rescuing the Princess but he could think of none. In spite of the dragon’s threat he went back the next day and tried the same thing again. Again the dragon overtook him and snatched back the Princess.“I have spared you one time,” he said to the Prince, “and I will spare you this one time more for the sake of the water you gave me. But I warn you if you come again I will tear you to pieces.”But what man worthy the name will accept such a warning when the safety and happiness of his loved one is concerned? The next day while the dragon was out the Prince again returned to the castle.“It is plain,” he said to the Princess, “that we can never escape until we, too, get a magic horse. We must find out where the dragon got his. To-night when he comes home, speak him fair and caress his head and when he is in fine humor ask him about his horse—what kind of a horse it is and where he got it. Then I will come back to-morrow at this same hour and you can tell me.”So that night when the dragon came home the Princess allowed him to put his head in her lap and she scratched him softly behind the ears and petted him until he was purring like a giant cat.“Urrh! Urrh! Urrh!” purred the dragon. “How happy we are here, just you and I! What a foolish young man that Prince of yours is to think I’d let him carry you off! Urrh! Urrh! Urrh!”“Yes,” the Princess agreed, “he is foolish or he would never suppose his horse could outrace yours.”“Urrh! Urrh!” the dragon purred. “You’re right! He seems to think my horse is an ordinary horse. Why, I got my horse from the Old Woman of the Mountain and the only other horse in the world that can outstrip him is another horse that the Old Woman still has. The Prince would have a hard time getting him!”The Princess still scratching the dragon behind his ears, just where he loved it most, asked softly:“Urrh! Urrh! Urrh! Because the Old Woman will never give that horse away until a man comes along who is able to guard for three nights in succession the Old Woman’s mare and foal. Any one who attempts this and fails she kills. But even if a man were to succeed he would never get the right horse for the old witch would palm off another on him. Urrh! Urrh! Urrh! Oh, that feels good, my dear!”“How would she do that?” the Princess asked.“Urrh! Urrh! Urrh! You see she says to every man who undertakes to guard the mare: ‘If you succeed you may have any horse in my stable.’ Then she shows him twelve beautiful stallions with shiny coats, but she doesn’t show him a scrawny miserable looking beast that lies neglected on the dung heap. Yet this is the magic horse and brother to mine.”Now the Princess knew all she needed to know and the next day when the Prince came she told him what the dragon had said. So the Prince at once set out to find the Old Woman of the Mountain.He traveled three days over waste places and through strange lands. On the first day as he was riding along the shores of a lake he heard a little voice crying out:“Help me, brother, help me and—who knows?—some day I may help you!”The Prince looked down and saw a fish that was floundering on the sand. He dismounted to get the fish and throw it back into the water.“Take one of my scales,” the fish said. “Then if ever you need my help just rub the scale.”So the Prince, before he threw the fish into the lake, scraped off a scale and tied it in a corner of his handkerchief. Then he rode on.The second day a fox that had been caught in a trap called out to him:“Help me, brother, help me and—who knows?—some day I may help you!”The Prince opened the trap and the fox, before it limped away, gave the Prince one of its hairs and said:“If ever you need me, rub this hair.”The third day he met a raven that had fallen on a thorn and was pinned to the ground.“Help me, brother, help me!” the raven begged, “and—who knows?—some day I may help you!”The Prince lifted the raven off the thorn and the raven, before it flew away, gave the Prince one of its feathers saying:“If ever you need me, rub this feather.”So the Prince reached the house of the Old Woman of the Mountain with the fish’s scale, the fox’s hair, and the raven’s feather each safely tied in a corner of his handkerchief.The Old Woman of the Mountain was an ugly old witch with a long nose that hooked down and a long chin that hooked up.“Ha! Ha!” she cackled when she saw the Prince. “Another one that wants service with the Old Woman, eh?”“Yes,” said the Prince.“You know the conditions?” the Old Woman said. “Guard my mare and her foal for three nights in succession and you may have any horse in my stable. But if she escapes you, then your head is mine and I’ll stick it up there as a warning to other rash young men.”The Old Woman pointed to a high picket fence that surrounded the courtyard. On every picket but one there was a grinning human skull. The Prince looked and the only picket that had no skull called out:“I want my skull, granny! I want my skull!”The Old Woman gave a wicked laugh.“You see,” she said, “we were expecting you!”When night fell the Prince led out the mare and her foal to a grassy meadow. To make sure that she would not escape him, he mounted her. Midnight came and he must have fallen asleep for suddenly he awoke to find himself astride a rail with an empty bridle in his hand. In despair he looked in all directions. At one end of the meadow was a pond.“She may have gone there to drink,” he said to himself.At the pond he saw a hoofprint.“Ah,” he thought, “if my fish were here, it could tell me.”He untied the corner of the handkerchief that had the fish scale, rubbed the scale gently, and at once a little voice called out from the water:“What is it, brother? Can I help you?”“Can you tell me what has become of the Old Woman’s mare and foal?”“Aye, brother, that I can! She and the foal are turned into fish and are down here in the water hiding amongst us. Strike the water three times with the bridle and say: ‘Mare of the Old Woman, come out!’ That will bring her!”The Prince did this. There was a commotion in the water, a big fish and a little fish leaped high in the air, fell on shore, and instantly changed to mare and foal. When morning came the Prince drove them back to the Old Woman.She grinned and pretended to be pleased but, when she had the mare alone in the stable, the Prince heard her beating the poor creature and saying:“Why didn’t you do as I told you and hide among the fishes?”“I did,” whinnied the mare, “but the fishes are his friends and he found me!”“To-night,” the Old Woman snarled, “hide among the foxes and this time don’t let him find you! Do you hear me? The foxes!”The Prince remembered this and the second night when he awoke to find himself again sitting astride a rail and holding an empty bridle in his hand, he untied the second corner of his handkerchief, took out the fox’s hair, and rubbed it gently.Instantly he heard a little bark and the fox’s voice said:“What is it, brother? Can I help you?”“Can you tell me,” the Prince asked, “what has become of the Old Woman’s mare and foal?”“Aye, brother, that I can! She and the foal are turned into foxes and are over in yonder woods now hiding among my people. Strike the earth three times with the bridle and say: ‘Mare of the Old Woman, come back!’ That will bring her!”The Prince did this and instantly two foxes, a vixen and a cub, came trotting out of the woods and when they reached the Prince they changed back to mare and foal.In the morning the Prince drove them home to the Old Woman. As before she grinned and pretended to be pleased but when she had the mare alone in the stable the Prince heard her giving the poor creature another beating and saying:“Why didn’t you do as I told you and hide among the foxes?”“I did,” whinnied the mare, “but the foxes are his friends, too, and he found me!”“To-night,” the Old Woman ordered, “hide among the ravens and this time don’t let him find you!”The third night the Prince tried hard to stay awake but sleep again overcame him and when he woke he found himself for the third time sitting astride a rail and holding the empty bridle in his hand. But he remembered the Old Woman’s words and at once opened the third corner of his handkerchief and taking out the raven’s feather rubbed it gently.There was a flutter of wings and a raven’s hoarse voice said:“Caw! Caw! What is it, brother? Can I help you?”“Can you tell me what has become of the Old Woman’s mare and foal?”“Aye, brother, that I can! She and the foal are turned into ravens and are perched in yonder tall fir tree hiding among my folk. Strike the trunk of the tree three times with your bridle and say: ‘Mare of the Old Woman, come down!’ That will bring her!”The Prince went over to the fir tree, struck it three times with the bridle and said:“Mare of the Old Woman, come down!”Instantly two ravens, a big one and a fledgling, fluttered to earth and changed to mare and foal. So when morning came the Prince was able to drive them back to the Old Woman and claim his reward.The Old Woman was angry enough to kill him but she pretended to be pleased and she smiled and grinned and she patted the Prince on the arm and said:“Aye, my son, but you are a hero! You have won the reward and you are worthy of it. Choose now the finest horse in my stable. It is yours.”She drove the twelve handsome stallions out into the courtyard and urged them on the Prince one after the other. But at each the Prince shook his head.“I am only a poor adventurer,” he said. “Such horses as these are too fine for me. Give me rather that poor mangy creature that lies over yonder on the dung heap. That is the one I choose.”Then the Old Woman fell into an awful rage and shook and chattered and begged the Prince not to take that horse.“It would shame me,” she said, “to have you ride off on that poor beast which is half dead already! No, no, my son, you mustn’t take him!”“But that’s the one I’m going to take,” the Prince said firmly, “that and none other!” He drew his sword and lifted it threateningly. “I have won whatever horse I choose and now, Old Woman, if you do not keep your bargain I shall strike you dead with this sword and stick up your grinning skull on that empty picket!”At that the empty picket began to shout:“I want my skull! I want my skull!”When the Old Woman of the Mountain saw that the Prince knew what he was about, she gave up trying to deceive him and let him lead off the horse he wanted. So the Prince walked away dragging the poor mangy creature after him. When he was out of sight of the Old Woman’s house, he turned to the horse and began rubbing down his rough coat and patting his wobbly legs.“Now, my beauty,” he said, “we’ll see what you’re made of!”Under his hand the mangy beast changed to a glorious animal—one of those wonder horses of the olden days that rise on the wind and gallop with the clouds. Soon his coat shone like burnished gold and his tail and mane streamed out like flames of fire.“Ah, my master,” the horse said, “I have been waiting for you this many a day! We shall have glorious adventures together!”Then the Prince mounted him and he rose on the wind and went so swiftly that he covered in three minutes all the distance that it had taken the Prince three days to go on an ordinary horse. Whiff! and there they were at the dragon’s castle and there was the Princess running out to welcome them.“Now, my dear one,” the Prince said, lifting the Princess up in front of him, “this time the dragon will not overtake us!”The wonder horse rose on the wind and off they went.When the dragon got home and found that the Princess had fled again, he said to his horse:“Shall we follow her at once or shall we eat supper first?”“It’s all one what we do,” the horse said, “for we shall never overtake her.”At that the dragon leaped upon his horse and, mounting on the wind, started off in hot pursuit. Presently they caught sight of the other horse carrying the Prince and the Princess but, try as he would, the dragon’s horse could not overtake the other. The dragon beat his horse unmercifully and dug his sharp claws into the horse’s tender flanks until the horse in agony called out to the Prince’s horse:“Hold, brother, hold! Let me overtake you or this monster will kill me with his cruelty!”“Why do you carry such a monster?” the Prince’s horse called back. “Throw him from you and be rid of him forever!”At that the dragon’s horse reared suddenly and the dragon, losing his balance, fell and was dashed to pieces on the rocks below.And that was the end of that dragon!Then the Princess wept but her tears were tears of joy for she knew now that the enchantment that had bound her was broken forever. Never again would she be changed into a peafowl at the whim of a wicked dragon, never again be separated from her loved one. Presently she mounted the dragon’s horse and together she and the Prince returned to the beautiful city. The people came out to meet them and when they heard of the dragon’s death a holiday was proclaimed and amidst music and dancing and merrymaking the Princess married the Prince. Then she was made Queen of that beautiful city and the Prince was made King. They ruled long and wisely and better than that they lived happily for they loved each other.So now you know the story of the Peafowl who became a Queen and of the Tsar’s Youngest Son who married her.","['potato', 'face', 'blind', 'begin', 'talk', 'arithmetic', 'geography', 'number', 'come', 'subtract', 'multiply', 'first', 'fraction', 'decimal', 'point', 'invent', 'give', 'river', 'name',

2174,slavic,Lord and Master - The Story of the Man Who Understood the Language of the Animals,"There was once a young shepherd, an honest industrious fellow, who passed most of his time in the hills looking after his master’s flocks. One afternoon he happened upon a bush which some gipsies had set a-fire. As he stopped to watch it he heard a strange hissing, whistling sound. He went as close as he could and in the center of the bush which the flames had not yet reached he saw a snake. It was writhing and trembling in fear.“Help me, brother!” the snake said. “Help me and I will reward you richly! I swear I will!”The shepherd put the end of his crook over the flames and the snake crawled up the crook, up the shepherd’s arm, and wound itself about his neck.It was now the shepherd’s turn to be frightened.“What! Will you kill me as a reward for my kindness?”“Nay,” the snake said. “Do not be afraid. I will not injure you. Do as I tell you and you will have nothing to regret. My father is the Tsar of the Snakes. Take me to him and he will reward you for rescuing me.”“But I can’t leave my flocks,” the shepherd said.“Have no fear about your flocks. Nothing will happen to them in your absence.”“But I don’t know where your father, the Tsar of the Snakes, lives,” the shepherd protested.“I’ll show you,” the snake said. “I’ll point out the direction with my tail.”So in spite of his misgivings the shepherd at last agreed to the snake’s suggestion and, leaving his sheep in God’s care, started up the mountainside in the direction which the snake pointed out with his tail.They reached finally a sort of pocket in the hills which was sandy and rocky and exposed to the full force of the sun. The snake directed the shepherd to the entrance of a cave which had a huge door composed entirely of living snakes closely wound together. The shepherd’s snake said something in his breathy whistling voice and the door pulled itself apart and allowed the shepherd to enter the cave.“Now,” whispered the snake, “when my father asks you what you want, tell him you want the gift of understanding the language of the animals. He will try to give you something else but don’t you accept anything else.”The Tsar of the Snakes was a huge creature clothed in a gorgeous skin of red and yellow and black. They found him reclining on a golden table with a crown of precious jewels on his head.“My son!” he cried, when he saw the snake that was still wound about the shepherd’s neck, “where have you been? We have been grieving for you thinking you had met some misfortune.”“But for this shepherd, my father,” the snake said, “I should have been burned to death. He rescued me.”Then he told the Tsar of the Snakes the whole story. The Tsar of the Snakes listened carefully and when the Snake Prince was finished he turned to the shepherd and said:“Sir, I am deeply indebted to you for saving my son’s life. Ask of me anything I can grant and it is yours.”“Give me then,” the shepherd said, “the gift of understanding the language of the animals.”“Not that!” the Tsar of the Snakes cried. “It is too dangerous a gift! If ever you confessed to some other human being that you had this gift and repeated what some animal said you would die that instant. Ask something else—anything else!”“No,” the shepherd insisted. “Give me that or nothing!”When the Tsar of the Snakes saw that the shepherd was not to be dissuaded, he said:“Very well, then. What must be, must be. Come now very close to me and put your mouth against my mouth. Do you breathe three times into my mouth and I shall breathe three times into your mouth. Then you will understand the language of the animals.”So the shepherd put his mouth close to the mouth of the Tsar of the Snakes and breathed into it three times. Then the Tsar of the Snakes breathed into the shepherd’s mouth three times.“Now you will understand the language of all animals,” the Tsar of the Snakes said. “It is a dangerous gift but if you remember my warning it may bring you great prosperity. Farewell.”So the shepherd went back to his flocks and lay down under a fir tree to rest. Presently he wondered whether he hadn’t been asleep and dreamed about the burning bush and the snake and the Tsar of the Snakes.“It can’t be real!” he said to himself. “How can I or any man understand the language of the animals!”Just then two ravens alighted on the tree above his head.“Caw! Caw!” said one of them. “Wouldn’t that shepherd be surprised if he knew he was lying on some buried treasure!”“Caw! Caw!” laughed the other. “He’ll never know for he’s only one of those poor stupid human beings who can’t understand a word we say!”The ravens flew off and the shepherd sat up and rubbed his eyes to make sure he was awake.“Am I dreaming again?” he asked himself, “or did I really understand them? Well, I’ll soon find out. To-morrow I’ll bring a spade and then if there’s any treasure buried under this tree I won’t be long in digging it up.”He marked the spot where he had been lying when the ravens spoke and the next day came back and dug. Three feet below the surface his spade hit something that proved to be a big iron pot chock-full of golden ducats.He carried the treasure to his master and his master was so pleased at his honesty that he gave him half of it.So now the shepherd was able to set up in life for himself. He bought a farm and married and “settled down” as the saying is. The years went by and he grew prosperous and rich.One Christmas Eve he said to his wife:“I’m thinking, wife, of my youth when I was a shepherd and how lonely it was at times like this when other folk were at home seated about the fire and making merry. Let us give our shepherds out on the hills a surprise to-night. We can take them meats and wine and other food and then I’ll go out and guard the sheep while you serve them a fine Christmas supper.”His wife agreed and they mounted their horses and rode out to the hills taking with them great hampers of food and wine. The wife entertained the shepherds in their hut with a big jolly supper and the master stayed outside all night with the dogs guarding the sheep.At midnight some wolves came prowling around the flocks.“See here,” they said to the dogs, “if you let us in we’ll kill the sheep and then we’ll divide the carcasses with you.”The dogs for the most part were young and thoughtless and ready enough to fall in with the wolves’ suggestion. But there was one old sheepdog that nothing could tempt.“I’ve only a few teeth left!” he growled, “but those few are still sound and let any wolf come a step nearer and I’ll tear him to pieces!”All night long that one old sheepdog stood on guard faithful to duty.In the morning the master ordered the shepherds to kill the young dogs and train in new ones.The shepherds were surprised.“The master’s a clever one!” they told each other. “Just one night and he found out how worthless those young dogs were!”As the farmer and his wife were riding home, the farmer’s horse ran on ahead.“Not so fast!” begged the mare that the wife was riding. “Have pity on me and go more slowly. You have only the master to carry while I’m all laden down with hampers and empty jugs and I don’t know what and with a mistress that’s twice as big as she was a few months ago!”The farmer when he heard the mare’s complaint burst out laughing.“What are you laughing at?” his wife asked sharply.“Nothing,” the farmer said.“You’re laughing at me!” the wife declared, “I know you are, just because I’m so big that I’m awkward in the saddle!”“No, my dear, I’m not laughing at you, truly I’m not.”“You are! I know you are and I don’t think it’s kind of you, either!” And the wife burst into tears.“Now, my dear,” the husband said, soothingly, “be sensible and believe me when I tell you I was not laughing at you.”“Then what were you laughing at?”“I can’t tell you because if I did tell you then I should die the next moment.”“Die the next moment!” the wife said. “Stuff and nonsense! It must be a strange thing indeed if a man can’t tell his own wife for fear he’ll die the next moment!”The more she thought about it the more enraged she became and also the more curious.“If you really loved me, you’d tell me!” she wept.All the way home she kept on worrying her husband and nagging at him until at last in utter exhaustion he said:“Peace, woman, peace, and I’ll tell you! But first let me have my coffin made for as I’ve warned you I shall die the moment I’ve spoken.”So he had the village carpenter build him a coffin and when it was ready he stood it up on end against the house and got inside of it.The news of what was about to happen spread among the animals and the faithful old sheepdog hurried down from the hills to be with his master at the end. He lay down at the foot of the coffin and howled.“I’ve one faithful friend!” the farmer said. “Wife, give the poor dog some bread before I tell you my secret and die.”The woman threw the old dog a hunk of bread but the dog refused it and kept on howling.The rooster from the barnyard came running up and began gobbling down the bread with great gusto.“You shameless animal!” the dog said sternly. “Here’s the poor master about to die on account of that foolish inquisitive wife of his and yet you have so little feeling that you’re delighted at the chance to gorge yourself with food!”The rooster clucked scornfully.“See here, old dog, I can’t waste any sympathy on that master of ours! Any man who allows his wife to bully him deserves whatever he gets! Look at me!” The rooster puffed out his chest and gave a loud: “Cock-a-doodle-do! I’ve got fifty wives but do they bully me? They do not! Whenever I find a nice fat worm or a grain of corn I set up an awful noise and gather them all around me. Then I eat it while they stand there and admire me! No, no, old dog, I have no patience with the master! He has only one wife and he doesn’t know how to rule her!”“The rooster’s right!” thought the farmer.With that he jumped out of the coffin, picked up a stick, and gave his wife a sound beating.“So you’d kill your husband just to satisfy your curiosity, would you?” he shouted angrily. “Very well, then! Take this and this and this! And if your curiosity is still unsatisfied I’ll give you some more!”“Stop! Stop! Stop!” cried the wife. “Do you want to injure me!”But the farmer did not stop until he had given her such a whipping that she never forgot it. When it was over she begged his pardon humbly and promised never again to ask him anything that he didn’t want to tell her.“You just mustn’t let me be so foolish again!” she said.“I won’t!” the farmer declared.Then he puffed out his chest and strutted about until you’d have laughed to see him—he looked so much like the rooster!","['upon', 'time', 'woman', 'live', 'small', 'cottage', 'near',

2251,slavic,Kovlad - 2. The Lost Child,"Long long ago there lived a very rich nobleman. But though he was so rich he was not happy, for he had no children to whom he could leave his wealth. He was, besides, no longer young. Every day he and his wife went to church to pray for a son. At last, after long waiting, God sent them what they desired. Now the evening before its arrival the father dreamed that its chance of living would depend upon one condition, namely, that its feet never touched the earth until it was twelve years old. Great care was taken that this should be avoided, and when the little stranger came, only trustworthy nurses were employed to look after him. As the years passed on the child was diligently guarded, sometimes he was carried in his nurses’ arms, sometimes rocked in his golden cradle, but his feet never touched the ground.Now when the end of the time drew near the father began preparations for a magnificent feast which should be given to celebrate his son’s release. One day while these were in progress a frightful noise, followed by most unearthly yells, shook the castle. The nurse dropped the child in her terror and ran to the window: that instant the noises ceased. On turning to take up the boy, imagine her dismay when she found him no longer there, and remembered that she had disobeyed her master’s orders.Hearing her screams and lamentations, all the servants of the castle ran to her. The father soon followed, asking, “What is the matter? What has happened? Where is my child?” The nurse, trembling and weeping, told of the disappearance of his son, his only child. No words can tell the anguish of the father’s heart. He sent servants in every direction to hunt for his boy, he gave orders, he begged and prayed, he threw away money right and left, he promised everything if only his son might be restored to him. Search was made without loss of time, but no trace of him could be discovered; he had vanished as completely as if he had never existed.Many years later the unhappy nobleman learnt that in one of the most beautiful rooms of the castle, footsteps, as of some one walking up and down, and dismal groans, were heard every midnight. Anxious to follow the matter up, for he thought it might in some way concern his lost son, he made known that a reward of three hundred gold pieces would be given to any one who would watch for one whole night in the haunted room. Many were willing, but had not the courage to stay till the end; for at midnight, when the dismal groans were heard, they would run away rather than risk their lives for three hundred gold pieces. The poor father was in despair, and knew not how to discover the truth of this dark mystery.Now close to the castle dwelt a widow, a miller by trade, who had three daughters. They were very poor, and hardly earned enough for their daily needs. When they heard of the midnight noises in the castle and the promised reward, the eldest daughter said, “As we are so very poor we have nothing to lose; surely we might try to earn these three hundred gold pieces by remaining in the room one night. I should like to try, mother, if you will let me.”The mother shrugged her shoulders, she hardly knew what to say; but when she thought of their poverty and the difficulty they had to earn a living she gave permission for her eldest daughter to remain one night in the haunted room. Then the daughter went to ask the nobleman’s consent.“Have you really the courage to watch for a whole night in a room haunted by ghosts? Are you sure you are not afraid, my good girl?”“I am willing to try this very night,” she replied. “I would only ask you to give me some food to cook for my supper, for I am very hungry.”Orders were given that she should be supplied with everything she wanted, and indeed enough food was given her, not for one supper only, but for three. With the food, some dry firewood and a candle, she entered the room. Like a good housewife, she first lit the fire and put on her saucepans, then she laid the table and made the bed. This filled up the early part of the evening. The time passed so quickly that she was surprised to hear the clock strike twelve, while at the last stroke, footsteps, as of some one walking, shook the room, and dismal groans filled the air. The frightened girl ran from one corner to the other, but could not see any one. But the footsteps and the groans did not cease. Suddenly a young man approached her and asked, “For whom is this food cooked?”“For myself,” she said.The gentle face of the stranger saddened, and after a short silence he asked again, “And this table, for whom is it laid?”“For myself,” she replied.The brow of the young man clouded over, and the beautiful blue eyes filled with tears as he asked once more, “And this bed, for whom have you made it?”“For myself,” replied she in the same selfish and indifferent tone.Tears fell from his eyes as he waved his arms and vanished.Next morning she told the nobleman all that had happened, but without mentioning the painful impression her answers had made upon the stranger. The three hundred golden crowns were paid, and the father was thankful to have at last heard something that might possibly lead to the discovery of his son.On the following day the second daughter, having been told by her sister what to do and how to answer the stranger, went to the castle to offer her services. The nobleman willingly agreed, and orders were given that she should be provided with everything she might want. Without loss of time she entered the room, lit the fire, put on the saucepans, spread a white cloth upon the table, made the bed, and awaited the hour of midnight. When the young stranger appeared and asked, “For whom is this food prepared? for whom is the table laid? for whom is the bed made?” she answered as her sister had bidden her, “For me, for myself only.”As on the night before, he burst into tears, waved his arms, and suddenly disappeared.Next morning she told the nobleman all that had happened except the sad impression her answers had made upon the stranger. The three hundred gold pieces were given her, and she went home.On the third day the youngest daughter wanted to try her fortune.“Sisters,” said she, “as you have succeeded in earning three hundred gold crowns each, and so helping our dear mother, I too should like to do my part and remain a night in the haunted room.”Now the widow loved her youngest daughter more dearly than the others, and dreaded to expose her to any danger; but as the elder ones had been successful, she allowed her to take her chance. So with the instructions from her sisters as to what she should do and say, and with the nobleman’s consent and abundant provisions, she entered the haunted room. Having lit the fire, put on the saucepans, laid the table and made the bed, she awaited with hope and fear the hour of midnight.As twelve o’clock struck, the room was shaken by the footsteps of some one who walked up and down, and the air was filled with cries and groans. The girl looked everywhere, but no living being could she see. Suddenly there stood before her a young man who asked in a sweet voice, “For whom have you prepared this food?”Now her sisters had told her how to answer and how to act, but when she looked into the sad eyes of the stranger she resolved to treat him more kindly.“Well, you do not answer me; for whom is the food prepared?” he asked again impatiently, as she made no reply. Somewhat confused, she said, “I prepared it for myself, but you too are welcome to it.”At these words his brow grew more serene.“And this table, for whom is it spread?”“For myself, unless you will honour me by being my guest.”A bright smile illumined his face.“And this bed, for whom have you made it?”“For myself, but if you have need of rest it is for you.”He clapped his hands for joy and replied, “Ah, that’s right; I accept the invitation with pleasure, and all that you have been so kind as to offer me. But wait, I pray you wait for me; I must first thank my kind friends for the care they have taken of me.”A fresh warm breath of spring filled the air, while at the same moment a deep precipice opened in the middle of the floor. He descended lightly, and she, anxious to see what would happen, followed him, holding on to his mantle. Thus they both reached the bottom of the precipice. Down there a new world opened itself before her eyes. To the right flowed a river of liquid gold, to the left rose high mountains of solid gold, in the centre lay a large meadow covered with millions of flowers. The stranger went on, the girl followed unnoticed. And as he went he saluted the field flowers as old friends, caressing them and leaving them with regret. Then they came to a forest where the trees were of gold. Many birds of different kinds began to sing, and flying round the young stranger perched familiarly on his head and shoulders. He spoke to and petted each one. While thus engaged, the girl broke off a branch from one of the golden trees and hid it in remembrance of this strange land.Leaving the forest of gold, they reached a wood where all the trees were of silver. Their arrival was greeted by an immense number of animals of various kinds. These crowded together and pushed one against another to get close to their friend. He spoke to each one and stroked and petted them. Meanwhile the girl broke off a branch of silver from one of the trees, saying to herself, “These will serve me as tokens of this wonderful land, for my sisters would not believe me if I only told them of it.”When the young stranger had taken leave of all his friends he returned by the paths he had come, and the girl followed without being seen. Arrived at the foot of the precipice, he began to ascend, she coming silently after, holding on to his mantle. Up they went higher and higher, until they reached the room in the castle. The floor closed up without trace of the opening. The girl returned to her place by the fire, where she was standing when the young man approached.“All my farewells have been spoken,” said he, “now we can have supper.”She hastened to place upon the table the food so hurriedly prepared, and sitting side by side they supped together. When they had made a good meal he said, “Now it is time to rest.”He lay down on the carefully-made bed, and the girl placed by his side the gold and silver branches she had picked in the Mineral Land. In a few moments he was sleeping peacefully.Next day the sun was already high in the sky, and yet the girl had not come to give an account of herself. The nobleman became impatient; he waited and waited, becoming more and more uneasy. At last he determined to go and see for himself what had happened. Picture to yourself his surprise and joy, when on entering the haunted chamber he saw his long-lost son sleeping on the bed, while beside him sat the widow’s beautiful daughter. At that moment the son awoke. The father, overwhelmed with joy, summoned the attendants of the castle to rejoice with him in his new-found happiness.Then the young man saw the two branches of metal, and said with astonishment, “What do I see? Did you then follow me down there? Know that by this act you have broken the spell and released me from the enchantment. These two branches will make two palaces for our future dwelling.”Thereupon he took the branches and threw them out of the window. Immediately there were seen two magnificent palaces, one of gold, the other of silver. And there they lived happily as man and wife, the nobleman’s son and the miller’s daughter. And if not dead they live there still.","['young', 'walk', 'erin', 'lead', 'stout', 'cart-horse', 'bridle', 'think', 'mother', 'poor', 'since', 'father', 'fisherman', 'drown', 'wonder', 'earn',

2263,slavic,The Wonderful Hair - The Story of a Poor Man Who Dreamed of an Angel,"There was once a poor man who had so many children that he was at his wit’s end how to feed them all and clothe them.“Unless something turns up soon,” he thought to himself, “we shall all starve to death. Poor youngsters—I’m almost tempted to kill them with my own hands to save them from suffering the pangs of hunger!”That night before he went to sleep he prayed God to give him help. God heard his prayer and sent an angel to him in a dream.The angel said to him:“To-morrow morning when you wake, put your hand under your pillow and you will find a mirror, a red handkerchief, and an embroidered scarf. Without saying a word to any one hide these things in your shirt and go out to the woods that lie beyond the third hill from the village. There you will find a brook. Follow it until you come to a beautiful maiden who is bathing in its waters. You will know her from the great masses of golden hair that fall down over her shoulders. She will speak to you but do you be careful not to answer. If you say a word to her she will be able to bewitch you. She will hold out a comb to you and ask you to comb her hair. Take the comb and do as she asks. Then part her back hair carefully and you will see one hair that is coarser than the others and as red as blood. Wrap this firmly around one of your fingers and jerk it out. Then flee as fast as you can. She will pursue you and each time as she is about to overtake you drop first the embroidered scarf, then the red handkerchief, and last the mirror. If you reach the hill nearest your own village you are safe for she can pursue you no farther. Take good care of the single hair for it great value and you can sell it for many golden ducats.”In the morning when the poor man awoke and put his hand under his pillow he found the mirror and the handkerchief and the scarf just as the angel had said he would. So he hid them carefully in his shirt and without telling any one where he was going he went to the woods beyond the third hill from the village. Here he found the brook and followed it until he came to a pool where he saw a lovely maiden bathing.“Good day to you!” she said politely.The poor man remembering the angel’s warning made no answer.The maiden held out a golden comb.“Please comb my hair for me, won’t you?”The man nodded and took the comb. Then he parted the long tresses behind and searched here and there and everywhere until he found the one hair that was blood-red in color and coarser than the others. He twisted this firmly around his finger, jerked it quickly out, and fled.“Oh!” cried the maiden. “What are you doing? Give me back my one red hair!”She jumped to her feet and ran swiftly after him. As she came close to him, he dropped behind him the embroidered scarf. She stooped and picked it up and examined it awhile. Then she saw the man was escaping, so she tossed the scarf aside and again ran after him. This time he dropped the red handkerchief. Its bright color caught the maiden’s eye and she picked it up and lost a few more minutes admiring it while the man raced on. Then the maiden remembered him, threw away the handkerchief, and started off again in pursuit.This time the man dropped the mirror and the maiden who of course was a Vila and had never seen a mirror before picked it up and looked at it and when she saw the lovely reflection of herself she was so amazed that she kept on looking and looking. She was still looking in it and still admiring her own beauty when the man reached the third hill beyond which the maiden couldn’t follow him.So the poor man got home with the hair safely wound about his finger.“It must be of great value,” he thought to himself. “I’ll take it to the city and offer it for sale there.”So the next day he went to the city and went about offering his wonderful hair to the merchants.“What’s so wonderful about it?” they asked him.“I don’t know, but I do know it’s of great value,” he told them.“Well,” said one of them, “I’ll give you one golden ducat for it.”He was a shrewd buyer and the others hearing his bid of one golden ducat decided that he must know that the hair was of much greater value. So they began to outbid him until the price offered the poor man reached one hundred golden ducats. But the poor man insisted that this was not enough.“One hundred golden ducats not enough for one red hair!” cried the merchants.They pretended to be disgusted that any one would refuse such a price for one red hair, but in reality they were all firmly convinced by this time that it was a magic hair and probably worth any amount of money in the world.The whole city became excited over the wonderful hair for which all the merchants were bidding and for a time nothing else was talked about. The matter was reported to the Tsar and at once he said that he himself would buy the hair for one thousand golden ducats.One thousand golden ducats! After that there was no danger of the poor man’s many children dying of starvation.And what do you suppose the Tsar did with the hair? He had it split open very carefully and inside he found a scroll of great importance to mankind for on it were written many wonderful secrets of nature.","['poor', 'widow', 'whose', 'brother-in-law',

2294,slavic,The Abode of the Gods - 3. The Twelve Months,"There was once a widow who had two daughters, Helen, her own child by her dead husband, and Marouckla, his daughter by his first wife. She loved Helen, but hated the poor orphan, because she was far prettier than her own daughter. Marouckla did not think about her good looks, and could not understand why her stepmother should be angry at the sight of her. The hardest work fell to her share; she cleaned out the rooms, cooked, washed, sewed, spun, wove, brought in the hay, milked the cow, and all this without any help. Helen, meanwhile, did nothing but dress herself in her best clothes and go to one amusement after another. But Marouckla never complained; she bore the scoldings and bad temper of mother and sister with a smile on her lips, and the patience of a lamb. But this angelic behaviour did not soften them. They became even more tyrannical and grumpy, for Marouckla grew daily more beautiful, while Helen’s ugliness increased. So the stepmother determined to get rid of Marouckla, for she knew that while she remained her own daughter would have no suitors. Hunger, every kind of privation, abuse, every means was used to make the girl’s life miserable. The most wicked of men could not have been more mercilessly cruel than these two vixens. But in spite of it all Marouckla grew ever sweeter and more charming.One day in the middle of winter Helen wanted some wood-violets.“Listen,” cried she to Marouckla; “you must go up the mountain and find me some violets, I want some to put in my gown; they must be fresh and sweet-scented—do you hear?”“But, my dear sister, who ever heard of violets blooming in the snow?” said the poor orphan.“You wretched creature! Do you dare to disobey me?” said Helen. “Not another word; off with you. If you do not bring me some violets from the mountain forest, I will kill you.”The stepmother also added her threats to those of Helen, and with vigorous blows they pushed Marouckla outside and shut the door upon her. The weeping girl made her way to the mountain. The snow lay deep, and there was no trace of any human being. Long she wandered hither and thither, and lost herself in the wood. She was hungry, and shivered with cold, and prayed to die. Suddenly she saw a light in the distance, and climbed towards it, till she reached the top of the mountain. Upon the highest peak burnt a large fire, surrounded by twelve blocks of stone, on which sat twelve strange beings. Of these the first three had white hair, three were not quite so old, three were young and handsome, and the rest still younger.There they all sate silently looking at the fire. They were the twelve months of the year. The great Setchène (January) was placed higher than the others; his hair and moustache were white as snow, and in his hand he held a wand. At first Marouckla was afraid, but after a while her courage returned, and drawing near she said:“Men of God, may I warm myself at your fire? I am chilled by the winter cold.”The great Setchène raised his head and answered:“What brings thee here, my daughter? What dost thou seek?”“I am looking for violets,” replied the maiden.“This is not the season for violets; dost thou not see the snow everywhere?” said Setchène.“I know well, but my sister Helen and my stepmother have ordered me to bring them violets from your mountain: if I return without them they will kill me. I pray you, good shepherds, tell me where they may be found?”Here the great Setchène arose and went over to the youngest of the months, and placing his wand in his hand, said:“Brother Brezène (March), do thou take the highest place.”Brezène obeyed, at the same time waving his wand over the fire. Immediately the flames rose towards the sky, the snow began to melt and the trees and shrubs to bud; the grass became green, and from between its blades peeped the pale primrose. It was Spring, and the meadows were blue with violets.“Gather them quickly, Marouckla,” said Brezène.Joyfully she hastened to pick the flowers, and having soon a large bunch she thanked them and ran home. Helen and the stepmother were amazed at the sight of the flowers, the scent of which filled the house.“Where did you find them?” asked Helen.“Under the trees on the mountain slope,” said Marouckla.Helen kept the flowers for herself and her mother; she did not even thank her step-sister for the trouble she had taken. The next day she desired Marouckla to fetch her strawberries.“Run,” said she, “and fetch me strawberries from the mountain: they must be very sweet and ripe.”“But who ever heard of strawberries ripening in the snow?” exclaimed Marouckla.“Hold your tongue, worm; don’t answer me; if I don’t have my strawberries I will kill you.”Then the stepmother pushed her into the yard and bolted the door. The unhappy girl made her way towards the mountain and to the large fire round which sat the twelve months. The great Setchène occupied the highest place.“Men of God, may I warm myself at your fire? The winter cold chills me,” said she, drawing near.The great Setchène raised his head and asked:“Why comest thou here? What dost thou seek?”“I am looking for strawberries,” said she.“We are in the midst of winter,” replied Setchène; “strawberries do not grow in the snow.”“I know,” said the girl sadly, “but my sister and stepmother have ordered me to bring them strawberries; if I do not they will kill me. Pray, good shepherds, tell me where to find them.”The great Setchène arose, crossed over to the month opposite him, and putting the wand into his hand, said:“Brother Tchervène (June), do thou take the highest place.”Tchervène obeyed, and as he waved his wand over the fire the flames leapt towards the sky. Instantly the snow melted, the earth was covered with verdure, trees were clothed with leaves, birds began to sing, and various flowers blossomed in the forest. It was summer. Under the bushes masses of star-shaped flowers changed into ripening strawberries. Before Marouckla had time to cross herself they covered the glade, making it look like a sea of blood.“Gather them quickly, Marouckla,” said Tchervène.Joyfully she thanked the months, and having filled her apron ran happily home. Helen and her mother wondered at seeing the strawberries, which filled the house with their delicious fragrance.“Wherever did you find them?” asked Helen crossly.“Right up among the mountains; those from under the beech trees are not bad.”Helen gave a few to her mother and ate the rest herself; not one did she offer to her step-sister. Being tired of strawberries, on the third day she took a fancy for some fresh red apples.“Run, Marouckla,” said she, “and fetch me fresh red apples from the mountain.”“Apples in winter, sister? why, the trees have neither leaves nor fruit.”“Idle slut, go this minute,” said Helen; “unless you bring back apples we will kill you.”As before, the stepmother seized her roughly and turned her out of the house. The poor girl went weeping up the mountain, across the deep snow upon which lay no human footprint, and on towards the fire round which were the twelve months. Motionless sat they, and on the highest stone was the great Setchène.“Men of God, may I warm myself at your fire? The winter cold chills me,” said she, drawing near.The great Setchène raised his head.“Why com’st thou here? What dost thou seek?” asked he.“I am come to look for red apples,” replied Marouckla.“But this is winter, and not the season for red apples,” observed the great Setchène.“I know,” answered the girl, “but my sister and stepmother sent me to fetch red apples from the mountain; if I return without them they will kill me.”Thereupon the great Setchène arose and went over to one of the elderly months, to whom he handed the wand, saying:“Brother Zaré (September), do thou take the highest place.”Zaré moved to the highest stone and waved his wand over the fire. There was a flare of red flames, the snow disappeared, but the fading leaves which trembled on the trees were sent by a cold north-east wind in yellow masses to the glade. Only a few flowers of autumn were visible, such as the fleabane and red gillyflower, autumn colchicums in the ravine, and under the beeches bracken and tufts of northern heather. At first Marouckla looked in vain for red apples. Then she espied a tree which grew at a great height, and from the branches of this hung the bright red fruit. Zaré ordered her to gather some quickly. The girl was delighted and shook the tree. First one apple fell, then another.“That is enough,” said Zaré, “hurry home.”Thanking the months, she returned joyfully. Helen marvelled and the stepmother wondered at seeing the fruit.“Where did you gather them?” asked the step-sister.“There are more on the mountain top,” answered Marouckla.“Then why did you not bring more?” said Helen angrily; “you must have eaten them on your way back, you wicked girl.”“No, dear sister, I have not even tasted them,” said Marouckla. “I shook the tree twice; one apple fell each time. I was not allowed to shake it again, but was told to return home.”“May Perum smite you with his thunderbolt,” said Helen, striking her.Marouckla prayed to die rather than suffer such ill-treatment. Weeping bitterly, she took refuge in the kitchen. Helen and her mother found the apples more delicious than any they had ever tasted, and when they had eaten both longed for more.“Listen, mother,” said Helen. “Give me my cloak; I will fetch some more apples myself, or else that good-for-nothing wretch will eat them all on the way. I shall be able to find the mountain and the tree. The shepherds may cry ‘Stop,’ but I shall not leave go till I have shaken down all the apples.”In spite of her mother’s advice she put on her pelisse, covered her head with a warm hood, and took the road to the mountain. The mother stood and watched her till she was lost in the distance.Snow covered everything, not a human footprint was to be seen on its surface. Helen lost herself and wandered hither and thither. After a while she saw a light above her, and following in its direction reached the mountain top. There was the flaming fire, the twelve blocks of stone, and the twelve months. At first she was frightened and hesitated; then she came nearer and warmed her hands. She did not ask permission, nor did she speak one polite word.“What has brought thee here? What dost thou seek?” said the great Setchène severely.“I am not obliged to tell you, old greybeard; what business is it of yours?” she replied disdainfully, turning her back on the fire and going towards the forest.The great Setchène frowned, and waved his wand over his head. Instantly the sky became covered with clouds, the fire went down, snow fell in large flakes, an icy wind howled round the mountain. Amid the fury of the storm Helen added curses against her step-sister. The pelisse failed to warm her benumbed limbs. The mother kept on waiting for her; she looked from the window, she watched from the doorstep, but her daughter came not. The hours passed slowly, but Helen did not return.“Can it be that the apples have charmed her from her home?” thought the mother. Then she clad herself in hood and pelisse and went in search of her daughter. Snow fell in huge masses; it covered all things, it lay untouched by human footsteps. For long she wandered hither and thither; the icy north-east wind whistled in the mountain, but no voice answered her cries.Day after day Marouckla worked and prayed, and waited; but neither stepmother nor sister returned, they had been frozen to death on the mountain. The inheritance of a small house, a field, and a cow fell to Marouckla. In course of time an honest farmer came to share them with her, and their lives were happy and peaceful.","['certain', 'empire', 'certain', 'province', 'ocean', 'island', 'bujan', 'stood', 'green',

2348,slavic,"The Broad Man, the Tall Man, and the Man with Eyes of Flame","In those days the king of a certain country had a daughter, who was not only exceedingly beautiful but also remarkably clever. Many kings and princes travelled from far distant lands, each one with the hope of making her his wife. But she would have nothing to do with any one of them. Finally, it was proclaimed that she would marry that man who for three successive nights should keep such strict watch upon her that she could not escape unnoticed. Those who failed were to have their heads cut off.The news of this offer was noised about in all parts of the world. A great many kings and princes hastened to make the trial, taking their turn and keeping watch. But each one lost his life in the attempt, for they could not prevent, indeed they were not even able to see, the princess take her flight.Now it happened that Matthias, prince of a royal city, heard of what was going on and resolved to watch through the three nights. He was young, handsome as a deer, and brave as a falcon. His father did all he could to turn him from his purpose: he used entreaties, prayers, threats, in fact he forbade him to go, but in vain, nothing could prevent him. What could the poor father do? Worn-out with contention, he was at last obliged to consent. Matthias filled his purse with gold, girded a well-tried sword to his side, and quite alone started off to seek the fortune of the brave.Walking along next day, he met a man who seemed hardly able to drag one leg after the other.“Whither are you going?” asked Matthias.“I am travelling all over the world in search of happiness.”“What is your profession?”“I have no profession, but I can do what no one else can. I am called Broad, because I have the power of swelling myself out to such a size that there is room for a whole regiment of soldiers inside me.”So saying he puffed himself out till he formed a barricade from one side of the road to the other.“Bravo!” cried Matthias, delighted at this proof of his capacities. “By the way, would you mind coming with me? I, too, am travelling across the world in search of happiness.”“If there is nothing bad in it I am quite willing,” answered Broad. And they continued their journey together.A little further on they met a very slender man, frightfully thin, and tall and straight as a portico.“Whither are you going, good man?” asked Matthias, filled with curiosity at his strange appearance.“I am travelling about the world.”“To what profession do you belong?”“To no profession, but I know something every one else is ignorant of. I am called Tall, and with good reason. For without leaving the earth I can stretch out and reach up to the clouds. When I walk I clear a mile at each step.”Without more ado he lengthened himself out until his head was lost in the clouds, while he really cleared a mile at each step.“I like that, my fine fellow,” said Matthias. “Come, would you not like to travel with us?”’“Why not?” replied he. “I’ll come.”So they proceeded on their way together. While passing through a forest they saw a man placing trunks of trees one upon another.“What are you trying to do there?” asked Matthias, addressing him.“I have Eyes of Flame,” said he, “and I am building a pile here.” So saying he fixed his flaming eyes upon the wood, and the whole was instantly set alight.“You are a very clever and powerful man,” said Matthias, “would you like to join our party?”“All right, I am willing.”So the four travelled along together. Matthias was overjoyed to have met with such gifted companions, and paid their expenses generously, without complaining of the enormous sum of money he had to spend on the amount of food Broad consumed.After some days they reached the princess’s palace. Matthias had told them the object of his journey, and had promised each a large reward if he was successful. They gave him their word to work with a will at the task which every one up till then had failed to accomplish. The prince bought them each a handsome suit of clothes, and when they were all presentable sent them to tell the king, the princess’s father, that he had come with his attendants to watch three nights in the lady’s boudoir. But he took very good care not to say who he was, nor whence he had come.The king received them kindly, and after hearing their request said: “Reflect well before engaging yourselves in this, for if the princess should escape you will have to die.”“We very much doubt her escaping from us,” they replied, “but come what will, we intend to make the attempt and to begin at once.”“My duty was to warn you,” replied the monarch, smiling, “but if you still persist in your resolution I myself will take you to the lady’s apartments.”Matthias was dazzled at the loveliness of the royal maiden, while she, on her side, received the brilliant and handsome young man most graciously, not trying to hide how much she liked his good looks and gentle manner. Hardly had the king retired when Broad lay down across the threshold; Tall and the Man with Eyes of Flame placed themselves near the window; while Matthias talked with the princess, and watched her every movement attentively.Suddenly she ceased to speak, then after a few moments said, “I feel as if a shower of poppies were falling on my eyelids.”And she lay down on the couch, pretending to sleep.Matthias did not breathe a word. Seeing her asleep he sat down at a table near the sofa, leaned his elbows upon it, and rested his chin in the hollow of his hands. Gradually he felt drowsy and his eyes closed, as did those of his companions.Now this was the moment the princess was waiting for. Quickly changing herself into a dove, she flew towards the window. If it had not happened that one of her wings touched Tall’s hair he would not have awakened, and he would certainly never have succeeded in catching her if it had not been for the Man with Eyes of Flame, for he, as soon as he knew which direction she had taken, sent such a glance after her, that is, a flame of fire, that in the twinkling of an eye her wings were burnt, and having been thus stopped, she was obliged to perch on the top of a tree. From thence Tall reached her easily, and placed her in Matthias’ hands, where she became a princess again. Matthias had hardly awakened out of his sleep.Next morning and the morning after the king was greatly astonished to find his daughter sitting by the prince’s side, but he was obliged to keep silent and accept facts as they were, at the same time entertaining his guests royally. At the approach of the third night he spoke with his daughter, and begged her to practise all the magic of which she was capable, and to act in such a way as to free him from the presence of intruders of whom he knew neither the rank nor the fortune.As for Matthias, he used every means in his power to bring about a happy ending to such a hitherto successful undertaking. Before entering the princess’s apartments he took his comrades aside and said, “There is but one more stroke of luck, dear friends, and then we have succeeded. If we fail, do not forget that our four heads will roll on the scaffold.”“Come along,” replied the three; “never fear, we shall be able to keep good watch.”When they came into the princess’s room they hastened to take up their positions, and Matthias sat down facing the lady. He would have much preferred to remain with her without being obliged to keep watch all the time for fear of losing her for ever. Resolving not to sleep this time, he said to himself, “Now I will keep watch upon you, but when you are my wife I will rest.”At midnight, when sleep was beginning to overpower her watchers, the princess kept silence, and, stretching herself on the couch, shut her beautiful eyes as if she were really asleep.Matthias, his elbows on the table, his chin in the palms of his hand, his eyes fixed upon her, admired her silently. But as sleep closes even the eyes of the eagle, so it shut those of the prince and his companions.The princess, who all this time had been watching them narrowly and only waiting for this moment, got up from her seat, and changing herself into a little fly, flew out of the window. Once free, she again changed herself into a fish, and falling into the palace well, plunged and hid herself in the depths of the water.She would certainly have made her escape if, as a fly, she had not just touched the tip of the nose of the Man with Eyes of Flame. He sneezed, and opened his eyes in time to notice the direction in which she had disappeared. Without losing an instant he gave the alarm, and all four ran into the courtyard. The well was very deep, but that did not matter. Tall soon stretched himself to the required depth, and searched in all the corners: but he was unable to find the little fish, and it seemed impossible that it could ever have been there.“Now then, get out of that, I will take your place,” said Broad.And getting in at the top by the rim, he filled up all the inside of the well, stopping it so completely with his huge body that the water sprang out: but nothing was seen of the little fish.“Now it is my turn,” said the Man with Eyes of Flame, “I warrant I’ll dislodge this clever magician.”When Broad had cleared the well of his enormous person the water returned to its place, but it soon began to boil from the heat of the eyes of flame. It boiled and boiled, till it boiled over the rim; then, as it went on boiling and rising ever higher and higher, a little fish was seen to throw itself out on the grass half cooked. As it touched the ground it again took the form of the princess.Matthias went to her and kissed her tenderly.“You have conquered, my master and husband,” she said, “you have succeeded in preventing my escape. Henceforth I am yours, both by right of conquest and of my own free will.”The young man’s courtesy, strength, and gentleness, as well as his beauty, were very pleasing to the princess; but her father, the king, was not so ready to approve of her choice, and he resolved not to let her go with them. But this did not trouble Matthias, who determined to carry her off, aided by his three comrades. They soon all left the palace.The king was furious, and ordered his guards to follow them and bring them back under pain of death. Meanwhile Matthias, the princess, and the three comrades had already travelled a distance of some miles. When she heard the steps of the pursuers she begged the Man with Eyes of Flame to see who they were. Having turned to look, he told her that a large army of men on horseback were advancing at a gallop.“They are my father’s guards,” said she, “we shall have some difficulty in escaping them.”Then, seeing the horsemen draw nearer she took the veil from her face, and throwing it behind her in the direction of the wind, said, “I command as many trees to spring up as there are threads in this veil.”Instantly, in the twinkling of an eye, a high thick forest rose up between them. Before the soldiers had time to clear for themselves a pathway through this dense mass, Matthias and his party had been able to get far ahead, and even to take a little rest.“Look,” said the princess, “and see if they are still coming after us.”The Man with Eyes of Flame looked back, and replied that the king’s guards were out of the forest and coming towards them with all speed.“They will not be able to reach us,” cried she. And she let fall a tear from her eyes, saying as she did so, “Tear, become a river.”At the same moment a wide river flowed between them and their pursuers, and before the latter had found means of crossing it, Matthias and his party were far on in front.“Man with Eyes of Flame,” said the princess, “look behind and tell me how closely we are followed.”“They are quite near to us again,” he replied, “they are almost upon our heels.”“Darkness, cover them,” said she.At these words Tall drew himself up. He stretched and stretched and stretched until he reached the clouds, and there, with his hat he half covered the face of the sun. The side towards the soldiers was black as night, while Matthias and his party, lit up by the shining half, went a good way without hindrance.When they had travelled some distance, Tall uncovered the sun, and soon joined his companions by taking a mile at each step. They were already in sight of Matthias’ home, when they noticed that the royal guards were again following them closely.“Now it is my turn,” said Broad; “go on your way in safety, I will remain here. I shall be ready for them.”He quietly awaited their arrival, standing motionless, with his large mouth open from ear to ear. The royal army, who were determined not to turn back without having taken the princess, advanced towards the town at a gallop. They had decided among themselves that if it resisted they would lay siege to it.Mistaking Broad’s open mouth for one of the city gates, they all dashed through and disappeared.Broad closed his mouth, and having swallowed them, ran to rejoin his comrades in the palace of Matthias’ father. He felt somewhat disturbed with a whole army inside him, and the earth groaned and trembled beneath him as he ran. He could hear the shouts of the people assembled round Matthias, as they rejoiced at his safe return.“Ah, here you are at last, brother Broad,” cried Matthias, directly he caught sight of him. “But what have you done with the army? Where have you left it?”“The army is here, quite safe,” answered he, patting his enormous person. “I shall be very pleased to return them as they are, for the morsel is not very easy to digest.”“Come then, let them out of their prison,” said Matthias, enjoying the joke, and at the same time calling all the inhabitants to assist at the entertainment.Broad, who looked upon it as a common occurrence, stood in the middle of the palace square, and putting his hands to his sides, began to cough. Then—it was really a sight worth seeing—at each cough horsemen and horses fell out of his mouth, one over the other, plunging, hopping, jumping, trying who could get out of the way the quickest. The last one had a little difficulty in getting free, for he somehow got into one of Broad’s nostrils and was unable to move. It was only by giving a good sneeze that Broad could release him, the last of the royal cavaliers, and he lost no time in following his companions at the top of his speed.A few days later a splendid feast was given at the wedding of Prince Matthias and the princess. The king, her father, was also present. Tall had been sent to invite him. Owing to his knowledge of the road and the length of his limbs, he accomplished the journey so quickly that he was there before the royal horsemen had time to get back. It was well for them that it was so, for, had he not pleaded that their lives might be saved, their heads would certainly have been cut off for returning empty-handed.Everything was now arranged to everybody’s satisfaction. The princess’s father was delighted to know that his daughter was married to a rich and noble prince, and Matthias generously rewarded his brave travelling companions, who remained with him to the end of their days.","['early', 'dawn', 'distinguish', 'mandarin', 'leave', 'temple', 'city', 'duty', 'visit', 'temple', 'first', 'fifteenth', 'moon', 'whilst', 'city', 'still', 'asleep', 'offer',

2556,slavic,The Three Treasures of Giants,"Long, long ago, there lived an old man and his wife who had three sons; the eldest was called Martin, the second Michael, while the third was named Jack.One evening they were all seated round the table, eating their supper of bread and milk.‘Martin,’ said the old man suddenly, ‘I feel that I cannot live much longer. You, as the eldest, will inherit this hut; but, if you value my blessing, be good to your mother and brothers.’‘Certainly, father; how can you suppose I should do them wrong?’ replied Martin indignantly, helping himself to all the best bits in the dish as he spoke. The old man saw nothing, but Michael looked on in surprise, and Jack was so astonished that he quite forgot to eat his own supper.A little while after, the father fell ill, and sent for his sons, who were out hunting, to bid him farewell. After giving good advice to the two eldest, he turned to Jack.‘My boy,’ he said, ‘you have not got quite as much sense as other people, but if Heaven has deprived you of some of your wits, it was given you a kind heart. Always listen to what it says, and take heed to the words of your mother and brothers, as well as you are able!’ So saying the old man sank back on his pillows and died.The cries of grief uttered by Martin and Michael sounded through the house, but Jack remained by the bedside of his father, still and silent, as if he were dead also. At length he got up, and going into the garden, hid himself in some trees, and wept like a child, while his two brothers made ready for the funeral.No sooner was the old man buried than Martin and Michael agreed that they would go into the world together to seek their fortunes, while Jack stayed at home with their mother. Jack would have liked nothing better than to sit and dream by the fire, but the mother, who was very old herself, declared that there was no work for him to do, and that he must seek it with his brothers.So, one fine morning, all three set out; Martin and Michael carried two great bags full of food, but Jack carried nothing. This made his brothers very angry, for the day was hot and the bags were heavy, and about noon they sat down under a tree and began to eat. Jack was as hungry as they were, but he knew that it was no use asking for anything; and he threw himself under another tree, and wept bitterly.‘Another time perhaps you won’t be so lazy, and will bring food for yourself,’ said Martin, but to his surprise Jack answered:‘You are a nice pair! You talk of seeking your fortunes so as not to be a burden on our mother, and you begin by carrying off all the food she has in the house!’This reply was so unexpected that for some moments neither of the brothers made any answer. Then they offered their brother some of their food, and when he had finished eating they went their way once more.Towards evening they reached a small hut, and knocking at the door, asked if they might spend the night there. The man, who was a wood-cutter, invited them him, and begged them to sit down to supper. Martin thanked him, but being very proud, explained that it was only shelter they wanted, as they had plenty of food with them; and he and Michael at once opened their bags and began to eat, while Jack hid himself in a corner. The wife, on seeing this, took pity on him, and called him to come and share their supper, which he gladly did, and very good he found it. At this, Martin regretted deeply that he had been so foolish as to refuse, for his bits of bread and cheese seemed very hard when he smelt the savoury soup his brother was enjoying.‘He shan’t have such a chance again,’ thought he; and the next morning he insisted on plunging into a thick forest where they were likely to meet nobody.For a long time they wandered hither and thither, for they had no path to guide them; but at last they came upon a wide clearing, in the midst of which stood a castle. Jack shouted with delight, but Martin, who was in a bad temper, said sharply:‘We must have taken a wrong turning! Let us go back.’‘Idiot!’ replied Michael, who was hungry too, and, like many people when they are hungry, very cross also. ‘We set out to travel through the world, and what does it matter if we go to the right or to the left?’ And, without another word, took the path to the castle, closely followed by Jack, and after a moment by Martin likewise.The door of the castle stood open, and they entered a great hall, and looked about them. Not a creature was to be seen, and suddenly Martin–he did not know why–felt a little frightened. He would have left the castle at once, but stopped when Jack boldly walked up to a door in the wall and opened it. He could not for very shame be outdone by his younger brother, and passed behind him into another splendid hall, which was filled from floor to ceiling with great pieces of copper money.The sight quite dazzled Martin and Michael, who emptied all the provisions that remained out of their bags, and heaped them up instead with handfuls of copper.Scarcely had they done this when Jack threw open another door, and this time it led to a hall filled with silver. In an instant his brothers had turned their bags upside down, so that the copper money tumbled out on to the floor, and were shovelling in handfuls of the silver instead. They had hardly finished, when Jack opened yet a third door, and all three fell back in amazement, for this room as a mass of gold, so bright that their eyes grew sore as they looked at it. However, they soon recovered from their surprise, and quickly emptied their bags of silver, and filled them with gold instead. When they would hold no more, Martin said:‘We had better hurry off now lest somebody else should come, and we might not know what to do’; and, followed by Michael, he hastily left the castle. Jack lingered behind for a few minutes to put pieces of gold, silver, and copper into his pocket, and to eat the food that his brothers had thrown down in the first room. Then he went after them, and found them lying down to rest in the midst of a forest. It was near sunset, and Martin began to feel hungry, so, when Jack arrived, he bade him return to the castle and bring the bread and cheese that they had left there.‘It is hardly worth doing that,’ answered Jack; ‘for I picked up the pieces and ate them myself.’At this reply both brothers were beside themselves with anger, and fell upon the boy, beating him, and calling him names, till they were quite tired.‘Go where you like,’ cried Martin with a final kick; ‘but never come near us again.’ And poor Jack ran weeping into the woods.The next morning his brothers went home, and bought a beautiful house, where they lived with their mother like great lords.Jack remained for some hours in hiding, thankful to be safe from his tormentors; but when no one came to trouble him, and his back did not ache so much, he began to think what he had better do. At length he made up his mind to go to the caste and take away as much money with him as would enable him to live in comfort for the rest of his life. This being decided, he sprang up, and set out along the path which led to the castle. As before, the door stood open, and he went on till he had reached the hall of gold, and there he took off his jacket and tied the sleeves together so that it might make a kind of bag. He then began to pour in the gold by handfuls, when, all at once, a noise like thunder shook the castle. This was followed by a voice, hoarse as that of a bull, which cried:‘I smell the smell of a man.’ And two giants entered.‘So, little worm! it is you who steal our treasures!’ exclaimed the biggest. ‘Well, we have got you now, and we will cook you for supper!’ But here the other giant drew him aside, and for a moment or two they whispered together. At length the first giant spoke:‘To please my friend I will spare your life on condition that, for the future, you shall guard our treasures. If you are hungry take this little table and rap on it, saying, as you do so: “The dinner of an emperor!” and you will get as much food as you want.’With a light heart Jack promised all that was asked of him, and for some days enjoyed himself mightily. He had everything he could wish for, and did nothing from morning till night; but by-and-by he began to get very tired of it all.‘Let the giants guard their treasures themselves,’ he said to himself at last; ‘I am going away. But I will leave all the gold and silver behind me, and will take nought but you, my good little table.’So, tucking the table under his arm, he started off for the forest, but he did not linger there long, and soon found himself in the fields on the other side. There he saw an old man, who begged Jack to give him something to eat.‘You could not have asked a better person,’ answered Jack cheerfully. And signing to him to sit down with him under a tree, he set the table in front of them, and struck it three times, crying:‘The dinner of an emperor!’ He had hardly uttered the words when fish and meat of all kinds appeared on it!‘That is a clever trick of yours,’ said the old man, when he had eaten as much as he wanted. ‘Give it to me in exchange for a treasure I have which is still better. Do you see this cornet? Well, you have only to tell it that you wish for an army, and you will have as many soldiers as you require.’Now, since he had been left to himself, Jack had grown ambitious, so, after a moment’s hesitation, he took the cornet and gave the table in exchange. The old man bade him farewell, and set off down one path, while Jack chose another, and for a long time he was quite pleased with his new possession. Then, as he felt hungry, he wished for his table back again, as no house was in sight, and he wanted some supper badly. All at once he remembered his cornet, and a wicked thought entered his mind.‘Two hundred hussars, forward!’ cried he. And the neighing of horses and the clanking of swords were heard close at hand. The officer who rode at their head approached Jack, and politely inquired what he wished them to do.‘A mile or two along that road,’ answered Jack, ‘you will find an old man carrying a table. Take the table from him and bring it to me.’The officer saluted and went back to his men, who started at a gallop to do Jack’s bidding.In ten minutes they had returned, bearing the table with them.‘That is all, thank you,’ said Jack; and the soldiers disappeared inside the cornet.Oh, what a good supper Jack had that night, quite forgetting that he owed it to a mean trick. The next day he breakfasted early, and then walked on towards the nearest town. On the way thither he met another old man, who begged for something to eat.‘Certainly, you shall have something to eat,’ replied Jack. And, placing the table on the ground he cried:‘The dinner of an emperor!’ when all sorts of food dishes appeared. At first the old man ate quite greedily, and said nothing; but, after his hunger was satisfied, he turned to Jack and said:‘That is a very clever trick of yours. Give the table to me and you shall have something still better.’‘I don’t believe that there is anything better,’ answered Jack.‘Yes, there is. Here is my bag; it will give you as many castles as you can possibly want.’Jack thought for a moment; then he replied: ‘Very well, I will exchange with you.’ And passing the table to the old man, he hung the bag over his arm.Five minutes later he summoned five hundred lancers out of the cornet and bade them go after the old man and fetch back the table.Now that by his cunning he had obtained possession of the three magic objects, he resolved to return to his native place. Smearing his face with dirt, and tearing his clothes so as to look like a beggar, he stopped the passers by and, on pretence of seeking money or food, he questioned them about the village gossip. In this manner he learned that his brothers had become great men, much respected in all the country round. When he heard that, he lost no time in going to the door of their fine house and imploring them to give him food and shelter; but the only thing he got was hard words, and a command to beg elsewhere. At length, however, at their mother’s entreaty, he was told that he might pass the night in the stable. Here he waited until everybody in the house was sound asleep, when he drew his bag from under his cloak, and desired that a castle might appear in that place; and the cornet gave him soldiers to guard the castle, while the table furnished him with a good supper. In the morning, he caused it all to vanish, and when his brothers entered the stable they found him lying on the straw.Jack remained here for many days, doing nothing, and–as far as anybody knew–eating nothing. This conduct puzzled his brothers greatly, and they put such constant questions to him, that at length he told them the secret of the table, and even gave a dinner to them, which far outdid any they had ever seen or heard of. But though they had solemnly promised to reveal nothing, somehow or other the tale leaked out, and before long reached the ears of the king himself. That very evening his chamberlain arrived at Jack’s dwelling, with a request from the king that he might borrow the table for three days.‘Very well,’ answered Jack, ‘you can take it back with you. But tell his majesty that if he does not return it at the end of the three days I will make war upon him.’So the chamberlain carried away the table and took it straight to the king, telling him at the same time of Jack’s threat, at which they both laughed till their sides ached.Now the king was so delighted with the table, and the dinners it gave him, that when the three days were over he could not make up his mind to part with it. Instead, he sent for his carpenter, and bade him copy it exactly, and when it was done he told his chamberlain to return it to Jack with his best thanks. It happened to be dinner time, and Jack invited the chamberlain, who knew nothing of the trick, to stay and dine with him. The good man, who had eaten several excellent meals provided by the table in the last three days, accepted the invitation with pleasure, even though he was to dine in a stable, and sat down on the straw beside Jack.‘The dinner of an emperor!’ cried Jack. But not even a morsel of cheese made its appearance.‘The dinner of an emperor!’ shouted Jack in a voice of thunder. Then the truth dawned on him; and, crushing the table between his hands, he turned to the chamberlain, who, bewildered and half-frightened, was wondering how to get away.‘Tell your false king that to-morrow I will destroy his castle as easily as I have broken this table.’The chamberlain hastened back to the palace, and gave the king Jack’s message, at which he laughed more than before, and called all his courtiers to hear the story. But they were not quite so merry when they woke next morning and beheld ten thousand horsemen, and as many archers, surrounding the palace. The king saw it was useless to hold out, and he took the white flag of truce in one hand, and the real table in the other, and set out to look for Jack.‘I committed a crime,’ said he; ‘but I will do my best to make up for it. Here is your table, which I own with shame that I tried to steal, and you shall have besides, my daughter as your wife!’There was no need to delay the marriage when the table was able to furnish the most splendid banquet that ever was seen, and after everyone had eaten and drunk as much as they wanted, Jack took his bag and commanded a castle filled with all sorts of treasures to arise in the park for himself and his bride.At this proof of his power the king’s heart died within him.‘Your magic is greater than mine,’ he said; ‘and you are young and strong, while I am old and tired. Take, therefore, the sceptre from my hand, and my crown from my head, and rule my people better than I have done.’So at last Jack’s ambition was satisfied. He could not hope to be more than king, and as long as he had his cornet to provide him with soldiers he was secure against his enemies. He never forgave his brothers for the way they had treated him, though he presented his mother with a beautiful castle, and everything she could possibly wish for. In the centre of his own palace was a treasure chamber, and in this chamber the table, the cornet, and the bag were kept as the most prized of all his possessions, and not a week passed without a visit from king John to make sure they were safe. He reigned long and well, and died a very old man, beloved by his people. But his good example was not followed by his sons and his grandsons. They grew so proud that they were ashamed to think that the founder of their race had once been a poor boy; and as they and all the world could not fail to remember it, as long as the table, the cornet, and the bag were shown in the treasure chamber, one king, more foolish than the rest, thrust them into a dark and damp cellar.For some time the kingdom remained, though it became weaker and weaker every year that passed. Then, one day, a rumour reached the king that a large army was marching against him. Vaguely he recollected some tales he had heard about a magic cornet which could provide as many soldiers as would serve to conquer the earth, and which had been removed by his grandfather to a cellar. Thither he hastened that he might renew his power once more, and in that black and slimy spot he found the treasures indeed. But the table fell to pieces as he touched it, in the cornet there remained only a few fragments of leathern belts which the rats had gnawed, and in the bag nothing but broken bits of stone.And the king bowed his head to the doom that awaited him, and in his heart cursed the ruin wrought by the pride and foolishness of himself and his forefathers.","['allah', 'gracious', 'whose', 'dwell',

2580,slavic,The Girl in the Chest - The Story of the Third Sister Who was Brave and Good,"There was once a horrible Vampire who took the form of a handsome young man and went to the house of an old woman who had three daughters and pretended he wanted to marry the oldest.“I live far from here,” the Vampire said. “I own my own farm and am well-to-do and in marrying me, your daughter would get a desirable husband. Indeed, I am so well off that I don’t have to ask any dowry.”Now the old woman was so poor that she couldn’t have given a penny of dowry. That was the only reason why all three of her daughters hadn’t long ago been married to youths of their own village. So when the stranger said he would require no dowry, the old woman whispered to her oldest daughter:“He seems to be all right. Perhaps you had better take him.”The poor girl accepted her mother’s advice and that afternoon started off with the Vampire who said he would lead her home and marry her.They walked a great distance and as evening came on they reached a wild ghostly spot which frightened the girl half to death.“This way, my dear,” the Vampire said, pushing her into an opening in the earth. “We take this underground passage and soon we’ll be home.”The passage led to a sort of cave which really was the Vampire’s home.“What an awful place!” the poor girl cried in terror. “Let me out!”“Let you out, indeed!” the Vampire sneered, taking his own horrible shape and laughing cruelly. “Here you are and here you stay and if you don’t do everything I tell you, I’ll soon finish you! Here now, drink this.”He offered the poor girl a pitcher and when she saw what was in it she nearly fainted with horror.“No!” she cried. “I won’t! I won’t!”“If you don’t drink this,” the Vampire said, darkly, “then I’ll drink you!”And with that he killed her with no more feeling than if she were a fly.Then in a short time he went back to the old woman and said:“Dear mother, my poor wife is ill and she begs that you send her your second daughter to nurse her. She asks for her sister night and day and I fear she will die unless she sees her.”When the poor old mother heard this, she begged the second daughter to go at once with the young man and nurse her sick sister.Well, the same thing happened to the second sister and in no time at all the Vampire had killed her, too, to satisfy his awful thirst.Then he returned again to the old mother and this time he pretended that both sisters were sick and were trying for the third sister to come and nurse them. So the poor old woman sent her Youngest Daughter away with the Vampire.The Youngest Sister when she found out the truth about the horrid Vampire didn’t sit down and weep helplessly as the others had done and wait for the Vampire to kill her, but she prayed God’s help and then tried to find some way of escape.There were doors in the cave which the Vampire told her were doors to closets she must not enter. When the Vampire was out she opened these doors and found that they all led into long underground passages.“This is my one chance to get back to earth!” the girl thought and commending her undertaking to God she fled down one of the passages.You may be sure the Vampire when he came back and found her gone fell into a great rage. He went running wildly up and down the various passages and lost so much time searching the wrong passages that the girl was able to make good her escape and reach the upper world in safety.She came out in a wood with no sign of human habitation anywhere in sight.“What shall I do now?” she thought. “If I stay here alone and unprotected some wild beast or evil creature may get me.”So she knelt down and prayed God to give her a chest that she could lock from the inside with one of her own golden hairs so securely that no one could force it open. God heard her prayer and presently behind some bushes she found just such a chest. When it grew dark and she was ready to go to bed, she crept into the chest, locked it with a hair, and slept peacefully knowing that nothing could harm her.So she lived in the wood some time, eating berries and fruits, and sleeping safely in the chest.Now it so happened that the King’s son one morning went hunting in this very wood and caught a glimpse of the girl as she was gathering berries. He thought he had never seen such a beautiful creature and in stantly he fell in love with her. But when he reached the clump of bushes where he had seen her, she was gone. He called his huntsmen together and told them to search everywhere. They hunted for hours and all they could find was a chest. They tried to open the chest to see what was in it but couldn’t.“Waste no more time over it,” the Prince said at last. “Carry it home to the palace as it is and have it placed in my chamber.”The huntsmen did this and a few hours later when the girl peeped out of her chest she found herself alone in the Prince’s chamber. His supper was standing on a table in readiness for his coming. The girl ate the supper and was safely back in her chest before he arrived. When he did come the Prince was amazed to see empty plates and called the servants to know who had eaten his supper. The servants were as much surprised as the Prince and declared that no one had entered the chamber.The same thing happened the next day and the following day the Prince had one of his servants hide behind the curtains and watch to find out if possible how the food disappeared.The story the servant had to tell of what he saw was so thrilling that the Prince could scarcely wait for the next day when he himself hid behind the curtains and watched.The serving people put the food on the table and retired and presently the lid of the chest opened and the Prince saw the beautiful maiden of the wood step out. When she sat down at the table the Prince slipped up behind her and caught her in his arms.“You lovely creature!” he said, “I’m not going to let you escape me again!”At first the girl was greatly frightened but the Prince reassured her, telling her that he loved her dearly and only wanted to make her his wife.He led her at once to the King, his father, and the girl was so modest and lovely that the King soon agreed to the marriage.Everybody in court was delighted—everybody, that is, but the Chamberlain who had had hopes of marrying his own daughter to the Prince. His daughter was an ugly ill-tempered girl and the Prince had never even looked at her. The Chamberlain was sure, however, that with a little more time he could arrange the match to his liking. So the appearance of this beautiful girl who came from Heaven knows where threw him into a fearful rage and he decided to do away with her at any cost. Now he had in his employ a great burly Blackamoor. He called this fellow to him and he told him that he must kidnap the girl at once and kill her. The Blackamoor who was accustomed to do such deeds for the Chamberlain nodded and said he would.So when the palace was quiet that night he stole to the bedchamber where the girl was lying asleep, threw a great robe over her head to stifle her cries, and carried her off. She fainted away from fright and the Blackamoor thinking her dead tossed her into a field of nettles in the outskirts of the town.Now, as you can imagine, in the morning there was a great uproar in the palace when it was discovered that the Prince’s beautiful bride-to-be had disappeared. The Prince was utterly grief-stricken and refused to eat. The King and all the ladies of the court tried their best to comfort him but he turned away from them declaring he would die if his bride were not restored to him.The rascally Chamberlain put his handkerchief to his eyes and pretended to weep he was so affected by the sight of the Prince’s grief.“My dear boy,” he said, “I would that I could find this maiden for you! It breaks my heart to see you sad and unhappy! But I’m sorry to tell you that I hear she was a Vila and not a human maiden at all. You know how mysteriously she came, and now she’s gone just as mysteriously. So put the thought of her out of your mind and I’m sure you’ll soon find a human maiden who is worthy of your love. Come here, my daughter, and tell the Prince how sorry you are that he is in grief.”But the sight of the Chamberlain’s ugly daughter only made the Prince long the more for the beautiful girl who was gone.She meantime had found refuge in the hut of an old woman who had heard her groan in the early dawn when she lay among the nettles and had taken compassion on her.“You may stay with me until you’re well,” the old woman said.The girl was young and healthy and in a day or two had recovered the ill treatment she had suffered at the hands of the Blackamoor.“Won’t you let me live with you awhile, granny?” she said to the old woman. “I’ll cook and scrub and work and you won’t have to regret the little I eat.”“Can you cook? Because if you can perhaps you know a dish that would tempt the appetite of our poor young Prince,” the old woman said. “You know the poor boy has had a terrible disappointment in love and he refuses to eat. The heralds were out this morning proclaiming that the King would richly reward any one who could prepare a dish that would tempt the Prince’s appetite.”“Granny!” the girl said, “I know a wonderful way to prepare beans! Let me cook a dish of beans and do you carry them to the palace.”So the girl cooked the beans and placed them prettily in a dish and on one side of the dish she put a tiny little ringlet of her own golden hair.“If he sees the hair,” she thought to herself, “he’ll know the beans are from me.”And that’s exactly what happened. To please his father the Prince had consented to look at every dish as it came. He had already looked at hundreds of them before the old woman arrived and turned away from them all. Then the old woman came. As she passed before the Prince, she lifted the cover of the dish, held it towards him, and curtsied. The Prince was just about to turn away when he saw the tiny ringlet of hair.“Oh!” he said. “Wait a minute! Those beans look good!”To the King’s delight he took the dish out of the old woman’s hand, examined it carefully, and when no one was looking slipped the ringlet into his pocket. Then he ate the beans—every last one of them!The King gave the old woman some golden ducats and begged her to prepare another dish for the Prince on the morrow.So the next day the girl again sent a tiny ringlet of her hair on the side of the plate and again the Prince after scorning all the other food offered him took the old woman’s dish and ate it clean.On the third day the Prince engaged the old woman in conversation.“Where do you live, granny?”“In a little tumble-down house beside the nettles,” she told him.“Do you live alone?”“Just now,” the old woman said, “I have a dear girl living with me. I found her one morning lying in the nettles where some ruffians had left her for dead. She’s a good girl and she scrubs and bakes and cooks for me and lets me rest my poor old bones.”Now the Prince knew what he wanted to know.“Granny,” he said, “tomorrow’s Sunday. Now I want you to stay home in the afternoon because I’m coming to see you.”In great excitement the old woman hurried home and told the girl that the Prince was coming to see them on Sunday afternoon.“He mustn’t see me!” the girl said. “I’ll hide in the bread trough under a cloth and if he goes looking for me you tell him that I’ve gone out.”“Foolish child!” the old woman said. “Why should you hide from a handsome young man like the Prince?”But the girl insisted and at last when Sunday afternoon came the old woman was forced to let her lie down in the bread trough and cover her with a cloth.The Prince arrived and when he found the old woman there alone he was mightily disappointed.“Where’s that girl who lives with you?” he asked.“She’s gone out,” the old woman said.“Then I think I’ll wait till she comes back.”This made the old woman feel nervous.“But, my Prince, I don’t know when she’s coming back.”Just then the Prince thought he saw something move in the bread trough.“What’s that lumpy thing in the bread trough, granny?”“That? Oh, that’s just dough that’s rising, my Prince. I’m baking to-day.”“Then make me a loaf, granny. I’ll wait for it until it rises and until you bake it. Then I’ll eat it hot out of the oven.”What was the old woman to say to that? She fussed and fidgeted and thought again what a foolish young girl that was to be hiding in the bread trough when there was a handsome young Prince in the room.“I don’t know why that dough doesn’t rise,” she remarked at last.“Perhaps there’s something the matter with it,” the Prince said.Before the old woman could stop him, he jumped up, tossed the cloth aside, and there was his lovely bride!“Why are you hiding from me?” he asked as he lifted her up and kissed her tenderly.“Because I knew if you really loved me you would find me,” she said.“Now that I have found you,” the Prince declared, “I shall never let you leave me again.”Then the girl told the Prince about the wicked Chamberlain and the Blackamoor and it was all she and the old woman could do to keep the Prince from drawing his sword and rushing out instantly to kill both of them.The old woman begged the Prince to take the girl secretly to the King and have the King hear her story, and then let him pass judgment on the Chamberlain according to the laws of the land. At last the Prince agreed to this.So they covered the girl’s head with a veil and took her to the King. When the King heard her story he called the court together at once and told them the outrage that had been committed against his son’s promised bride. He commanded that the murderous Blackamoor be executed the next day and he decreed that the Chamberlain and his wicked daughter be stripped of their lands and riches and sent into exile.Let us hope that exile taught them the evil of their ways and made them repent.As for the girl, she married the Prince and they lived together in great happiness. And she deserved to be happy, too, for she was a brave girl and a good girl and God loves people who are brave and good and blesses them.","['first', 'good', 'fortune', 'beppo', 'decide', 'visit',

2585,slavic,The Enchanted Canary,"Once upon a time, in the reign of King Cambrinus, there lived at Avesnes one of his lords, who was the finest man–by which I mean the fattest–in the whole country of Flanders. He ate four meals a day, slept twelve hours out of the twenty-four, and the only thing he ever did was to shoot at small birds with his bow and arrow.Still, with all his practice he shot very badly, he was so fat and heavy, and as he grew daily fatter, he was at last obliged to give up walking, and be dragged about in a wheel-chair, and the people made fun of him, and gave him the name of my Lord Tubby.Now, the only trouble that Lord Tubby had was about his son, whom he loved very much, although they were not in the least alike, for the young Prince was as thin as a cuckoo. And what vexed him more than all was, that though the young ladies throughout all his lands did their best to make the Prince fall in love with them, he would have nothing to say to any of them, and told his father he did not wish to marry.Instead of chatting with them in the dusk, he wandered about the woods, whispering to the moon. No wonder the young ladies thought him very odd, but they liked him all the better for that; and as he had received at his birth the name of Desire, they all called him d’Amour Desire.`What is the matter with you?’ his father often said to him. `You have everything you can possibly wish for: a good bed, good food, and tuns full of beer. The only thing you want, in order to become as fat as a pig, is a wife that can bring you broad, rich lands. So marry, and you will be perfectly happy.’`I ask nothing better than to marry,’ replied Desire, `but I have never seen a woman that pleases me. All the girls here are pink and white, and I am tired to death of their eternal lilie and roses.`My faith!’ cried Tubby; `do you want to marry a negress, and give me grandchildren as ugly as monkeys and as stupid as owls?’`No, father, nothing of the sort. But there must be women somewhere in the world who are neither pink nor white, and I tell you, once for all, that I will never marry until I have found one exactly to my taste.’Some time afterwards, it happened that the Prior of the Abbey of Saint Amand sent to the Lord of Avesnes a basket of oranges, with a beautifully-written letter saying that these golden fruit, then unknown in Flanders, came straight from a land where the sun always shone.That evening Tubby and his son ate the golden apples at supper, and thought them delicious.Next morning as the day dawned, Desire went down to the stable and saddled his pretty white horse. Then he went, all dressed for a journey, to the bedside of Tubby, and found him smoking his first pipe.`Father,’ he said gravely, `I have come to bid you farewell. Last night I dreamed that I was walking in a wood, where the trees were covered with golden apples. I gathered one of them, and when I opened it there came out a lovely princess with a golden skin. That is the wife I want, and I am going to look for her.’The Lord of Avesnes was so much astonished that he let his pipe fall to the ground; then he became so diverted at the notion of his son marrying a yellow woman, and a woman shut up inside an orange, that he burst into fits of laughter.Desire waited to bid him good-bye until he was quiet again; but as his father went on laughing and showed no signs of stopping, the young man took his hand, kissed it tenderly, opened the door, and in the twinkling of an eye was as at the bottom of the staircase. He jumped lightly on his horse, and was a mile from home before Tubby had ceased laughing.`A yellow wife! He must be mad! fit for a strait waistcoat!’ cried the good man, when he was able to speak. `Here! quick! bring him back to me.’The servants mounted their horses and rode after the Prince; but as they did not know which road he had taken, they went all ways except the right one, and instead of bringing him back they returned themselves when it grew dark, with their horses worn out and covered with dust.When Desire thought they could no longer catch him, he pulled his horse into a walk, like a prudent man who knows he has far to go. He travelled in this way for many weeks, passing by villages, towns, mountains, valleys, and plains, but always pushing south, where every day the sun seemed hotter and more brilliant.At last one day at sunset Desire felt the sun so warm, that he thought he must now be near the place of his dream. He was at that moment close to the corner of a wood where stood a little hut, before the door of which his horse stopped of his own accord. An old man with a white beard was sitting on the doorstep enjoying the fresh air. The Prince got down from his horse and asked leave to rest.`Come in, my young friend,’ said the old man; `my house is not large, but it is big enough to hold a stranger.’The traveller entered, and his host put before him a simple meal. When his hunger was satisfied the old man said to him:`If I do not mistake, you come from far. May I ask where you are going?’`I will tell you,’ answered Desire, `though most likely you will laugh at me. I dreamed that in the land of the sun there was a wood full of orange trees, and that in one of the oranges I should find a beautiful princess who is to be my wife. It is she I am seeking.’`Why should I laugh?’ asked the old man. `Madness in youth is true wisdom. Go, young man, follow your dream, and if you do not find the happiness that you seek, at any rate you will have had the happiness of seeking it.’The next day the Prince arose early and took leave of his host.`The wood that you saw in your dream is not far from here,’ said the old man. `It is in the depth of the forest, and this road will lead you there. You will come to a vast park surrounded by high walls. In the middle of the park is a castle, where dwells a horrible witch who allows no living being to enter the doors. Behind the castle is the orange grove. Follow the wall till you come to a heavy iron gate. Don’t try to press it open, but oil the hinges with this,’ and the old man gave him a small bottle.`The gate will open of itself,’ he continued, `and a huge dog which guards the castle will come to you with his mouth wide open, but just throw him this oat cake. Next, you will see a baking woman leaning over her heated oven. Give her this brush. Lastly, you will find a well on your left; do not forget to take the cord of the bucket and spread it in the sun. When you have done this, do not enter the castle, but go round it and enter the orange grove. Then gather three oranges, and get back to the gate as fast as you can. Once out of the gate, leave the forest by the opposite side.`Now, attend to this: whatever happens, do not open your oranges till you reach the bank of a river, or a fountain. Out of each orange will come a princess, and you can choose which you like for your wife. Your choice once made, be very careful never to leave your bride for an instant, and remember that the danger which is most to be feared is never the danger we are most afraid of.’Desire thanked his host warmly, and took the road he pointed out. In less than an hour he arrived at the wall, which was very high indeed. He sprang to the ground, fastened his horse to a tree, and soon found the iron gate. Then he took out his bottle and oiled the hinges, when the gate opened of itself, and he saw an old castle standing inside. The Prince entered boldly into the courtyard.Suddenly he heard fierce howls, and a dog as tall as a donkey, with eyes like billiard balls, came towards him, showing his teeth, which were like the prongs of a fork. Desire flung him the oat cake, which the great dog instantly snapped up, and the young Prince passed quietly on.A few yards further he saw a huge oven, with a wide, red-hot gaping mouth. A woman as tall as a giant was leaning over the oven. Desire gave her the brush, which she took in silence.Then he went on to the well, drew up the cord, which was half rotten, and stretched it out in the sun.Lastly he went round the castle, and plunged into the orange grove. There he gathered the three most beautiful oranges he could find, and turned to go back to the gate.But just at this moment the sun was darkened, the earth trembled, and Desire heard a voice crying:`Baker, baker, take him by his feet, and throw him into the oven!’`No,’ replied the baker; `a long time has passed since I first began to scour this oven with my own flesh. YOU never cared to give me a brush; but he has given me one, and he shall go in peace.’`Rope, O rope!’ cried the voice again, `twine yourself round his neck and strangle him.’`No,’ replied the rope; `you have left me for many years past to fall to pieces with the damp. He has stretched me out in the sun. Let him go in peace.’`Dog, my good dog,’ cried the voice, more and more angry, `jump at his throat and eat him up.’`No,’ replied the dog; `though I have served you long, you nevergave me any bread. He has given me as much as I want. Let him go in peace.’`Iron gate, iron gate,’ cried the voice, growling like thunder, `fall on him and grind him to powder.’`No,’ replied the gate; `it is a hundred years since you left me to rust, and he has oiled me. Let him go in peace.’Once outside, the young adventurer put his oranges into a bag that hung from his saddle, mounted his horse, and rode quickly out of the forest.Now, as he was longing to see the princesses, he was very anxious to come to a river or a fountain, but, though he rode for hours, a river or fountain was nowhere to be seen. Still his heart was light, for he felt that he had got through the most difficult part of his task, and the rest was easy.About mid-day he reached a sandy plain, scorching in the sun. Here he was seized with dreadful thirst; he took his gourd and raised it to his lips.But the gourd was empty; in the excitement of his joy he had forgotten to fill it. He rode on, struggling with his sufferings, but at last he could bear it no longer.He let himself slide to the earth, and lay down beside his horse, his throat burning, his chest heaving, and his head going round. Already he felt that death was near him, when his eyes fell on the bag where the oranges peeped out.Poor Desire, who had braved so many dangers to win the lady of his dreams, would have given at this moment all the princesses in the world, were they pink or golden, for a single drop of water.`Ah!’ he said to himself. `If only these oranges were real fruit– fruit as refreshing as what I ate in Flanders! And, after all, who knows?’This idea put some life into him. He had the strength to lift himself up and put his hand into his bag. He drew out an orange and opened it with his knife.Out of it flew the prettiest little female canary that ever was seen.`Give me something to drink, I am dying of thirst,’ said the golden bird.`Wait a minute,’ replied Desire, so much astonished that he forgot his own sufferings; and to satisfy the bird he took a second orange, and opened it without thinking what he was doing. Out of it flew another canary, and she too began to cry:`I am dying of thirst; give me something to drink.’Then Tubby’s son saw his folly, and while the two canaries flew away he sank on the ground, where, exhausted by his last effort, he lay unconscious.When he came to himself, he had a pleasant feeling of freshness all about him. It was night, the sky was sparkling with stars, and the earth was covered with a heavy dew.The traveller having recovered, mounted his horse, and at the first streak of dawn he saw a stream dancing in front of him, and stooped down and drank his fill.He hardly had courage to open his last orange. Then he remembered that the night before he had disobeyed the orders of the old man. Perhaps his terrible thirst was a trick of the cunning witch, and suppose, even though he opened the orange on the banks of the stream, that he did not find in it the princess that he sought?He took his knife and cut it open. Alas! out of it flew a little canary, just like the others, who cried:`I am thirsty; give me something to drink.’Great was the disappointment of Desire. However, he was determined not to let this bird fly away; so he took up some water in the palm of his hand and held it to its beak.Scarcely had the canary drunk when she became a beautiful girl, tall and straight as a poplar tree, with black eyes and a golden skin. Desire had never seen anyone half so lovely, and he stood gazing at her in delight.On her side she seemed quite bewildered, but she looked about her with happy eyes, and was not at all afraid of her deliverer.He asked her name. She answered that she was called the Princess Zizi; she was about sixteen years old, and for ten years of that time the witch had kept her shut up in an orange, in the shape of a canary.`Well, then, my charming Zizi,’ said the young Prince, who was longing to marry her, `let us ride away quickly so as to escape from the wicked witch.’But Zizi wished to know where he meant to take her.`To my father’s castle,’ he said.He mounted his horse and took her in front of him, and, holding her carefully in his arms, they began their journey.Everything the Princess saw was new to her, and in passing through mountains, valleys, and towns, she asked a thousand questions. Desire was charmed to answer them. It is so delightful to teach those one loves!Once she inquired what the girls in his country were like.`They are pink and white,’ he replied, `and their eyes are blue.’`Do you like blue eyes?’ said the Princess; but Desire thought it was a good opportunity to find out what was in her heart, so he did not answer.`And no doubt,’ went on the Princess, `one of them is your intended bride?’Still he was silent, and Zizi drew herself up proudly.`No,’ he said at last. `None of the girls of my own country are beautiful in my eyes, and that is why I came to look for a wife in the land of the sun. Was I wrong, my lovely Zizi?’This time it was Zizi’s turn to be silent.Talking in this way they drew near to the castle. When they were about four stone-throws from the gates they dismounted in the forest, by the edge of a fountain.`My dear Zizi,’ said Tubby’s son, `we cannot present ourselves before my father like two common people who have come back from a walk. We must enter the castle with more ceremony. Wait for me here, and in an hour I will return with carriages and horses fit for a princess.’`Don’t be long,’ replied Zizi, and she watched him go with wistful eyes.When she was left by herself the poor girl began to feel afraid. She was alone for the first time in her life, and in the middle of a thick forest.Suddenly she heard a noise among the trees. Fearing lest it should be a wolf, she hid herself in the hollow trunk of a willow tree which hung over the fountain. It was big enough to hold her altogether, but she peeped out, and her pretty head was reflected in the clear water.Then there appeared, not a wolf, but a creature quite as wicked and quite as ugly. Let us see who this creature was.Not far from the fountain there lived a family of bricklayers. Now, fifteen years before this time, the father in walking through the forest found a little girl, who had been deserted by the gypsies. He carried her home to his wife, and the good woman was sorry for her, and brought her up with her own sons. As she grew older, the little gypsy became much more remarkable for strength and cunning than for sense or beauty. She had a low forehead, a flat nose, thick lips, coarse hair, and a skin not golden like that of Zizi, but the colour of clay.As she was always being teased about her complexion, she got as noisy and cross as a titmouse. So they used to call her Titty.Titty was often sent by the bricklayer to fetch water from the fountain, and as she was very proud and lazy the gypsy disliked this very much.It was she who had frightened Zizi by appearing with her pitcher on her shoulder. Just as she was stooping to fill it, she saw reflected in the water the lovely image of the Princess.`What a pretty face!’ she exclaimed, `Why, it must be mine! How in the world can they call me ugly? I am certainly much too pretty to be their water carrier!’So saying, she broke her pitcher and went home.`Where is your pitcher?’ asked the bricklayer.`Well, what do you expect? The pitcher may go many times to the well. . . .’`But at last it is broken. Well, here is a bucket that will not break.’The gypsy returned to the fountain, and addressing once more the image of Zizi, she said:`No; I don’t mean to be a beast of burden any longer.’ And she flung the bucket so high in the air that it stuck in the branches of an oak.`I met a wolf,’ she told the bricklayer, `and I broke the bucket across his nose.’The bricklayer asked her no more questions, but took down a broom and gave her such a beating that her pride was humbled a little.Then he handed to her an old copper milk-can, and said:`If you don’t bring it back full, your bones shall suffer for it.’Titty went off rubbing her sides; but this time she did not dare to disobey, and in a very bad temper stooped down over the well. It was not at all easy to fill the milk-can, which was large and round. It would not go down into the well, and the gypsy had to try again and again.At last her arms grew so tired that when she did manage to get the can properly under the water she had no strength to pull it up, and it rolled to the bottom.On seeing the can disappear, she made such a miserable face that Zizi, who had been watching her all this time, burst into fits of laughter.Titty turned round and perceived the mistake she had made; and she felt so angry that she made up her mind to be revenged at once.`What are you doing there, you lovely creature?’ she said to Zizi.`I am waiting for my lover,’ Zizi replied; and then, with a simplicity quite natural in a girl who so lately had been a canary, she told all her story.The gypsy had often seen the young Prince pass by, with his gun on his shoulder, when he was going after crows. She was too ugly and ragged for him ever to have noticed her, but Titty on her side had admired him, though she thought he might well have been a little fatter.`Dear, dear!’ she said to herself. `So he likes yellow women! Why, I am yellow too, and if I could only think of a way—-‘It was not long before she did think of it.`What!’ cried the sly Titty, `they are coming with great pomp to fetch you, and you are not afraid to show yourself to so many fine lords and ladies with your hair down like that? Get down at once, my poor child, and let me dress your hair for you!’The innocent Zizi came down at once, and stood by Titty. The gypsy began to comb her long brown locks, when suddenly she drew a pin from her stays, and, just as the titmouse digs its beak into the heads of linnets and larks, Titty dug the pin into the head of Zizi.No sooner did Zizi feel the prick of the pin than she became a bird again, and, spreading her wings, she flew away.`That was neatly done,’ said the gypsy. `The Prince will be clever if he finds his bride.’ And, arranging her dress, she seated herself on the grass to await Desire.Meanwhile the Prince was coming as fast as his horse could carry him. He was so impatient that he was always full fifty yards in front of the lords and ladies sent by Tubby to bring back Zizi.At the sight of the hideous gypsy he was struck dumb with surprise and horror.`Ah me!’ said Titty, `so you don’t know your poor Zizi? While you were away the wicked witch came, and turned me into this. But if you only have the courage to marry me I shall get back my beauty.’ And she began to cry bitterly.Now the good-natured Desire was as soft-hearted as he was brave.`Poor girl,’ he thought to himself. `It is not her fault, after all, that she has grown so ugly, it is mine. Oh! why did I not follow the old man’s advice? Why did I leave her alone? And besides, it depends on me to break the spell, and I love her too much to let her remain like this.’So he presented the gypsy to the lords and ladies of the Court, explaining to them the terrible misfortune which had befallen his beautiful bride.They all pretended to believe it, and the ladies at once put on the false princess the rich dresses they had brought for Zizi.She was then perched on the top of a magnificent ambling palfrey, and they set forth to the castle.But unluckily the rich dress and jewels only made Titty look uglier still, and Desire could not help feeling hot and uncomfortable when he made his entry with her into the city.Bells were pealing, chimes ringing, and the people filling the streets and standing at their doors to watch the procession go by, and they could hardly believe their eyes as they saw what a strange bride their Prince had chosen.In order to do her more honour, Tubby came to meet her at the foot of the great marble staircase. At the sight of the hideous creature he almost fell backwards.`What!’ he cried. `Is this the wonderful beauty?’`Yes, father, it is she,’ replied Desire with a sheepish look. `But she has been bewitched by a wicked sorceress, and will not regain her beauty until she is my wife.’`Does she say so? Well, if you believe that, you may drink cold water and think it bacon,’ the unhappy Tubby answered crossly.But all the same, as he adored his son, he gave the gypsy his hand and led her to the great hall, where the bridal feast was spread.The feast was excellent, but Desire hardly touched anything. However, to make up, the other guests ate greedily, and, as for Tubby, nothing ever took away his appetite.When the moment arrived to serve the roast goose, there was a pause, and Tubby took the opportunity to lay down his knife and fork for a little. But as the goose gave no sign of appearing, he sent his head carver to find out what was the matter in the kitchen.Now this was what had happened.While the goose was turning on the spit, a beautiful little canary hopped on to the sill of the open window.`Good-morning, my fine cook,’ she said in a silvery voice to the man who was watching the roast.`Good-morning, lovely golden bird,’ replied the chief of the scullions, who had been well brought up.`I pray that Heaven may send you to sleep,’ said the golden bird, `and that the goose may burn, so that there may be none left for Titty.’And instantly the chief of the scullions fell fast asleep, and the goose was burnt to a cinder.When he awoke he was horrified, and gave orders to pluck another goose, to stuff it with chestnuts, and put it on the spit.While it was browning at the fire, Tubby inquired for his goose a second time. The Master Cook himself mounted to the hall to make his excuses, and to beg his lord to have a little patience. Tubby showed his patience by abusing his son.`As if it wasn’t enough,’ he grumbled between his teeth, `that the boy should pick up a hag without a penny, but the goose must go and burn now. It isn’t a wife he has brought me, it is Famine herself.’While the Master Cook was upstairs, the golden bird came again to perch on the window-sill, and called in his clear voice to the head scullion, who was watching the spit:`Good-morning, my fine Scullion!’`Good-morning, lovely Golden Bird,’ replied the Scullion, whom the Master Cook had forgotten in his excitement to warn.`I pray Heaven,’ went on the Canary, `that it will send you to sleep, and that the goose may burn, so that there may be none left for Titty.’And the Scullion fell fast asleep, and when the Master Cook came back he found the goose as black as the chimney.In a fury he woke the Scullion, who in order to save himself from blame told the whole story.`That accursed bird,’ said the Cook; `it will end by getting me sent away. Come, some of you, and hide yourselves, and if it comes again, catch it and wring its neck.’He spitted a third goose, lit a huge fire, and seated himself by it.The bird appeared a third time, and said: `Good-morning, my fine Cook.’`Good-morning, lovely Golden Bird,’ replied the Cook, as if nothing had happened, and at the moment that the Canary was beginning, `I pray Heaven that it may send,’ a scullion who was hidden outside rushed out and shut the shutters. The bird flew into the kitchen. Then all the cooks and scullions sprang after it, knocking at it with their aprons. At length one of them caught it just at the very moment that Tubby entered the kitchen, waving his sceptre. He had come to see for himself why the goose had never made its appearance.The Scullion stopped at once, just as he was about to wring the Canary’s neck.`Will some one be kind enough to tell me the meaning of all this?’ cried the Lord of Avesnes.`Your Excellency, it is the bird,’ replied the Scullion, and he placed it in his hand.`Nonsense! What a lovely bird!’ said Tubby, and in stroking its head he touched a pin that was sticking between its feathers. He pulled it out, and lo! the Canary at once became a beautiful girl with a golden skin who jumped lightly to the ground.`Gracious! what a pretty girl!’ said Tubby.`Father! it is she! it is Zizi!’ exclaimed Desire, who entered at this moment.And he took her in his arms, crying: `My darling Zizi, how happy I am to see you once more!’`Well, and the other one?’ asked Tubby.The other one was stealing quietly to the door.`Stop her! called Tubby. `We will judge her cause at once.’And he seated himself solemnly on the oven, and condemned Titty to be burned alive. After which the lords and cooks formed themselves in lines, and Tubby betrothed Desire to Zizi.The marriage took place a few days later. All the boys in the country side were there, armed with wooden swords, and decorated with epaulets made of gilt paper.Zizi obtained Titty’s pardon, and she was sent back to the brick- fields, followed and hooted at by all the boys. And this is why to- day the country boys always throw stones at a titmouse.On the evening of the wedding-day all the larders, cellars, cupboards and tables of the people, whether rich or poor, were loaded as if by enchantment with bread, wine, beer, cakes and tarts, roast larks, and even geese, so that Tubby could not complain any more that his son had married Famine.Since that time there has always been plenty to eat in that country, and since that time, too, you see in the midst of the fair- haired blue-eyed women of Flanders a few beautiful girls, whose eyes are black and whose skins are the colour of gold. They are the descendants of Zizi.","['wish', 'could', 'story', 'pleasantly', 'fault', 'mine', 'song', 'sadly', 'believe', 'right', 'wise', 'though', 'hero', 'purify', 'malea', 'sacrifice', 'make',

2633,slavic,Kinkach Martinko,"Once upon a time there was a poor woman who had an only daughter, named Helen, a very lazy girl. One day when she had refused to do a single thing, her mother took her down to the banks of a stream and began to strike her fingers with a flat stone, just as you do in beating linen to wash it.The girl cried a good deal. A prince, Lord of the Red Castle, happened at that moment to pass by, and inquired as to the cause of such treatment, for it horrified him that a mother should so ill-use her child.“Why should I not punish her?” answered the woman. “The idle girl can do nothing but spin hemp into gold thread.”“Really?” cried he. “Does she really know how to spin gold thread out of hemp? If that be so, sell her to me.”“Willingly; how much will you give me for her?”“Half a measure of gold.”“Take her,” said the mother; and she gave him her daughter as soon as the money was paid.The prince placed the girl behind him on the saddle, put spurs to his horse, and took her home.On reaching the Red Castle, the prince led Helen into a room filled from floor to ceiling with hemp, and having supplied her with distaff and spinning-wheel, said, “When you have spun all this hemp into gold thread I will make you my wife.”Then he went out, locking the door after him.On finding herself a prisoner, the poor girl wept as if her heart would break. Suddenly she saw a very odd-looking little man seated on the window-sill. He wore a red cap, and his boots were made of some strange sort of material.“Why do you weep so?” he asked.“I cannot help it,” she replied, “I am but a miserable slave. I have been ordered to spin all this hemp into gold thread, but it is impossible, I can never do it, and I know not what will become of me.”“I will do it for you in three days, on condition that at the end of that time you guess my right name, and tell me what the boots I am wearing now are made of.”Without for one moment reflecting as to whether she would be able to guess aright she consented. The uncanny little man burst out laughing, and taking her distaff set to work at once.All day as the distaff moved the hemp grew visibly less, while the skein of gold thread became larger and larger.The little man spun all the time, and, without stopping an instant, explained to Helen how to make thread of pure gold. As night drew on he tied up the skein, saying to the girl, “Well, do you know my name yet? Can you tell me what my boots are made of?”Helen replied that she could not, upon which he grinned and disappeared through the window. She then sat and looked at the sky, and thought, and thought, and thought, and lost herself in conjecturing as to what the little man’s name might be, and in trying to guess what was the stuff his boots were made of. Were they of leather? or perhaps plaited rushes? or straw? or cast iron? No, they did not look like anything of that sort. And as to his name—that was a still more difficult problem to solve.“What shall I call him?” said she to herself—“John? Or Henry? Who knows? perhaps it is Paul or Joseph.”These thoughts so filled her mind that she forgot to eat her dinner. Her meditations were interrupted by cries and groans from outside, where she saw an old man with white hair sitting under the castle wall.“Miserable old man that I am,” cried he; “I die of hunger and thirst, but no one pities my sufferings.”Helen hastened to give him her dinner, and told him to come next day, which he promised to do.After again thinking for some time what answers she should give the little old man, she fell asleep on the hemp.The little old man did not fail to make his appearance the first thing next morning, and remained all day spinning the gold thread. The work progressed before their eyes, and it was only when evening came that he repeated his questions. Not receiving a satisfactory answer, he vanished in a fit of mocking laughter. Helen sat down by the window to think; but think as she might, no answer to these puzzling questions occurred to her.While thus wondering the hungry old man again came by, and she gave him her dinner. She was heart-sick and her eyes were full of tears, for she thought she would never guess the spinner’s name, nor of what stuff his boots were made, unless perhaps God would help her.“Why are you so sad?” asked the old man when he had eaten and drunk; “tell me the cause of your grief, dear lady.”For a long time she would not tell him, thinking it would be useless; but at last, yielding to his entreaties, she gave a full account of the conditions under which the gold thread was made, explaining that unless she could answer the little old man’s questions satisfactorily she feared some great misfortune would befall her. The old man listened attentively, then, nodding his head, he said:“In coming through the forest to-day I passed close to a large pile of burning wood, round which were placed nine iron pots. A little man in a red cap was running round and jumping over them, singing these words:“My sweet friend, fair Helen, at the Red Castle near,Two days and two nights seeks my name to divine.She’ll never find out, so the third night ’tis clearMy sweet friend, fair Helen, can’t fail to be mine.Hurrah! for my name is Kinkach Martinko,Hurrah! for my boots are of doggies’ skin O!”“Now that is exactly what you want to know, my dear girl; so do not forget, and you are saved.”And with these words the old man vanished.Helen was greatly astonished, but she took care to fix in her memory all that the good fellow had told her, and then went to sleep, feeling that she could face to-morrow without fear.On the third day, very early in the morning, the little old man appeared and set busily to work, for he knew that all the hemp must be spun before sunset, and that then he should be able to claim his rights. When evening came all the hemp was gone, and the room shone with the brightness of the golden thread.As soon as his work was done, the queer little old man with the red cap drew himself up with a great deal of assurance, and with his hands in his pockets strutted up and down before Helen, ordering her to tell him his right name and to say of what stuff the boots were made: but he felt certain that she would not be able to answer aright.“Your name is Kinkach Martinko, and your boots are made of dogskin,” she replied without the slightest hesitation.At these words he spun round on the floor like a bobbin, tore out his hair and beat his breast with rage, roaring so that the very walls trembled.“It is lucky for you that you have guessed. If you had not, I should have torn you to pieces on this very spot:” so saying he rushed out of the window like a whirlwind.Helen felt deeply grateful towards the old man who had told her the answers, and hoped to be able to thank him in person. But he never appeared again.The Prince of the Red Castle was very pleased with her for having accomplished her task so punctually and perfectly, and he married her as he had promised.Helen was truly thankful to have escaped the dangers that had threatened her, and her happiness as a princess was greater than she had dared hope. She had, too, such a good stock of gold thread that she never had occasion to spin any more all her life long.","['height', 'rise', 'mile', 'south', 'newark', 'delaware', 'call', 'iron', 'hill',

2865,slavic,The Nightingale in the Mosque - The Story of the Sultan's Youngest Son and the Princess Flower o' the World,"There was once a Sultan who was so pious and devout that he spent many hours every day in prayer.“For the glory of Allah,” he thought to himself, “I ought to build the most beautiful mosque in the world.”So he called together the finest artisans in the country and told them what he wanted. He spent a third of his riches on the undertaking, and when the mosque was finished everybody said:“See now, our Sultan has built the most beautiful mosque in the world for the greater glory of Allah!”On the first day when the Sultan went to pray in the new mosque, a Dervish who was sitting cross-legged at the entrance spoke to him in a droning sing-song voice and said:“Nay, but your mosque is not yet beautiful enough! There is something it lacks and your prayers will be unavailing!”The words of the holy man grieved the Sultan and he had the mosque torn down and another built in its place even more beautiful.“This is certainly the most beautiful mosque in the world!” the people said, and the Sultan’s heart was very happy on the first day as he went in to pray.But again the Dervish, seated at the entrance, said to him in his droning, sing-song voice:“Nay, but your mosque is not yet beautiful enough! There is something it lacks and your prayers will be unavailing!”At the holy man’s words the Sultan had the second mosque torn down and a third one built, the most beautiful of them all. But when it was finished for a third time the Dervish droned out:“Nay, but your mosque is not yet beautiful enough! There is something it lacks and your prayers will be unavailing!”“What can I do?” the Sultan cried. “I have spent all my riches and now I have no means wherewith to build another mosque!”He fell to grieving and nothing any one could say would comfort him.His three sons came to him and said:“Father, is there not something we can do for you?”The Sultan sighed and shook his head.“Nothing, my sons, unless indeed you were to find out for me why my third mosque is not the most beautiful in the world.”“Brothers,” the youngest suggested, “let us go to the Dervish and ask him why it is that the third mosque is not yet beautiful enough. Perhaps he will tell us what is lacking.”So they went to the Dervish and asked him what he meant by saying to the Sultan that the third mosque was not yet beautiful enough and they begged him to tell them what it was that was lacking.The Dervish fixed his eyes in the distance and slightly swaying his body back and forth answered them in his sing-song tone.“The mosque is beautiful,” he said, “and the fountain in its midst is beautiful, but where is the glorious Nightingale Gisar? With the Nightingale Gisar singing beside the fountain, then indeed would the Sultan’s third mosque be the most beautiful mosque in the world!”“Only tell us where this glorious Nightingale is,” the brothers begged, “and we will get him if it costs us our lives!”“I cannot tell you that,” the Dervish droned. “You will have to go out into the world and find him for yourselves.”So the three brothers returned to the Sultan and told him what the Dervish had said.“All your third mosque lacks to be the most beautiful mosque in the world,” they told him, “is the Nightingale Gisar singing beside the fountain. So grieve no more, father. We, your three sons, will go out into the world in quest of this glorious bird and within a year’s time we will return with the bird in our hands if so be that it is anywhere to be found in all the wide world.”The Sultan blessed them and they set forth the three of them, side by side. They traveled together until they reached a place where three roads branched. Upon the stone of the left-hand road nothing was written. Upon the stone of the middle road was the inscription: Who goes this way returns. The inscription on the third stone read: Who goes this way shall meet many dangers and may never return.“Let us part here,” the oldest brother said, “and each take a separate road. Then if all goes well, let us meet here again on this same spot one year hence. As our father’s oldest son it would be wrong for me to run unnecessary risks, so I will take the left-hand road.”“And I will take the middle road,” the second brother cried.The Youngest Brother laughed and said:“That leaves the dangerous road for me! Very well, brothers, that’s the very road I wish to take for why should I leave home if it were not to have adventures! Farewell then until we meet again in one year’s time.”The oldest traveled his safe road until he reached a city where he became a barber. He asked every man whose head he shaved:“Do you know anything of the Nightingale Gisar?”He never found any one who had even heard of the bird, so after a time he stopped asking.The second brother followed the middle road to a city where he settled down and opened a coffee-house.“Have you ever heard of a glorious Nightingale known as Gisar?” he asked at first of every traveler who came in and sipped his coffee. Not one of them ever had and as time went by the second brother gradually stopped even making inquiries.The Youngest Brother who took the dangerous road came to no city at all but to a far-off desolate place without houses or highways or farms. Wild creatures hid in the brush and snakes glided in and out among the rocks. One day he came upon a wild woman who was combing her hair with a branch of juniper.“That isn’t the way to comb your hair,” the Youngest Brother said. “Here, let me show you.”He took his own comb and smoothed out all the tangles in the wild woman’s hair until she was comfortable and happy.“You have been very kind to me,” she said. “Now isn’t there something I can do for you in return?”“I am looking for the Nightingale Gisar. If you know where that glorious bird is, tell me and that will more than repay me.”But the wild woman had never heard of the Nightingale Gisar.“Only wild animals inhabit this desolate place,” she said, “and a few wild people like me. The Nightingale Gisar is not here.”“Then I must go farther,” the Youngest Brother said.This the wild woman begged him not to do.“Beyond these mountains,” she said, “is a wilder desert with fiercer animals. Turn back while you can.”“No,” the Youngest Brother insisted, “I’m going as God leads me.”So he left the wild woman and crossed the mountains. He went on and on until he was footsore and weary. Then at last he came to the Tiger’s house.The Tiger’s wife met him.“Be off, young man!” she warned him, “or the Tiger when he comes home will eat you!”“No!” said the Youngest Brother, “now I’m here I’m going to stay for I have a question to ask the Tiger.”The Tiger’s wife was making bread. When the dough was ready to go into the oven, she leaned over the glowing embers of the fire and began to brush them aside with her body.“Stop!” the Youngest Brother cried. “You will burn yourself!”“But how else can I brush aside the glowing embers?” the Tiger’s wife asked.“I’ll show you.”The Youngest Brother cut a branch from a tree outside and fashioned it into a rough broom. Then he showed the Tiger’s wife how to use it.“Ah!” she said gratefully, “before this always when I’ve baked bread I’ve been sick for ten days afterwards. Now I shall be sick no more for you have taught me how to use a broom. In return let me hide you in a dark corner and when the Tiger comes home I’ll tell him how kind you have been and perhaps he will not eat you.”So she hid the Youngest Brother in a dark corner and when the Tiger came home she met him and said:“See, I have baked bread to-day but I am not sick, for a youth has shown me how I can brush aside the embers without burning myself.”The Tiger was overjoyed to hear that his wife had been able to bake bread without being made sick and he swore to be a brother to him who had taught her the use of a broom. So the Youngest Brother came out from the dark corner where he was hiding and the Tiger made him welcome.“What are you doing wandering about in this wild country?” the Tiger asked.“I am searching for the Nightingale Gisar and I have come to you to ask you if you can tell me where I can find that glorious bird.”The Tiger had never heard of the Nightingale Gisar but he thought that his oldest brother the Lion might know.“Go straight on from here,” he said, “until you come to the Lion’s house. His old wife stands outside facing the house with her long thin old dugs thrown over her shoulders. Go up to her from behind and take her dugs and put them in your mouth and suck them and when she asks you who you are, say: ‘Don’t you know me, old mother? I’m your oldest cub.’ Then she will lead you in to the Lion who is so old that his eyelids droop. Prop them open and when he sees you he will tell you what he knows.”So the Youngest Brother went on to the Lion’s house and he found the Lion’s old wife standing outside as the Tiger said he would. He did all the Tiger had told him to do and when the Lion’s wife asked him who he was, he said: ‘Don’t you know me, old mother? I’m your oldest cub.’ Then the Lion’s old wife led him in to the Lion and he propped open the Lion’s drooping eyelids and asked about the Nightingale Gisar.The old Lion shook his head.“I have never heard of the Nightingale Gisar. He has never sung in this wild place. Turn back, young man, and seek him elsewhere. Beyond this is a country of wilder creatures where you will only lose your life.”“That is as God wills,” the Youngest Brother said.With that he bade the old Lion and his old wife farewell and pushed on into the farther wilds. The mountains grew more and more rugged, the plains more parched and barren, and the Youngest Son was hard put to it to find food from day to day.Once when he was crossing a desert three eagles swooped down upon him and it was all he could do to fight them off. He slashed at them with his sword and succeeded in cutting off the beak of one, a wing of another, and a leg of the third. He put these three things in his bag as trophies.He came at last to a hut where an old woman was baking cakes on the hearth.“God bless you, granny!” he said. “Can you give me a bite of supper and shelter for the night?”The old woman shook her head.“My boy, you had better not stop here. I have three daughters and if they were to come home and find you here, they’d kill you.”But the Youngest Brother insisted that he was not afraid and at last the old woman let him stay. She hid him in the corner behind the firewood and warned him to keep still.Presently the three eagles whom he had maimed came flying into the hut. The old woman put a bowl of milk on the table, the birds dipped in the milk, and lo! their feather shirts opened and they stepped out three maidens. One of them had lost her lips, one an arm, and the third a leg.“Ah!” they cried to their mother, “see what has befallen us! If only the youth who maimed us would re turn the beak and the wing and the leg that he hacked off, we would tell him anything he wants to know.”At that the Youngest Brother stepped out from behind the firewood and said:“Tell me then where I can find the Nightingale Gisar and you shall have back your beak and your wing and your leg.”He opened his bag and the maidens were overjoyed to see their beak and their wing and their leg. Then they told the Youngest Brother all they knew about the Nightingale Gisar.“Far from here,” they said, “there is a Warrior Princess, so beautiful that men call her Flower o’ the World. She has the Nightingale Gisar in a golden cage hanging in her own chamber. The chamber door is guarded by a lion and a wolf and a tiger for the Flower o’ the World knows that she will have to marry the man who steals from her the Nightingale Gisar.”“How can a man enter the chamber of the Flower o’ the World?” the Youngest Brother asked.“For a few moments at midnight,” the sisters told him, “the three animals sleep. During those few moments a man could enter the chamber, get the Nightingale Gisar, and escape. But even then he might not be safe for the Flower o’ the World might gather her army together and pursue him.”“Now tell me how to reach the palace of that Warrior Princess, Flower o’ the World.”“You could never get there alone,” they told him, “the way is too long and the dangers are too many. Stay here with us for three months and at the end of three months we will carry you thither on our wings.”So for three months the Youngest Brother stayed on in the hut with the old woman and her three daughters. The three daughters flew in their eagle shirts to the spring of the Water of Life and bathing in that magic pool they made grow on again the beak and the wing and the leg which the Youngest Brother had hacked off.At the end of three months they carried the Youngest Brother on their wings to the distant kingdom where the Warrior Princess, Flower o’ the World, lived.At midnight they set him down in front of the palace and he slipped unseen through the guards at the gate and through the halls of the palace to the Princess’s own chamber. The lion, the wolf, and the tiger were asleep and he was able to push back the curtain before which they were lying and creep up to the Princess’s very bedside without being discovered.He looked once at the sleeping Flower o’ the World and she was so beautiful that he dared not look again for fear he should forget the Nightingale Gisar and betray himself by crying out.At the head of the bed were four lighted candles and at the foot four unlighted ones. He blew out the lighted ones and lit the others. Then quickly he took the golden cage in which the Nightingale Gisar was perched asleep, unfastened it from the golden chain on which it was hanging, and hurried out. The eagles were waiting for him and at once they spread their wings and carried him away.They put him down at the crossroads where he had parted from his brothers just one year before. Then they bade him farewell and flew off to their home in the desert.“My brothers will probably be here in an hour or so,” the Youngest Son thought. “I had better wait for them.”He felt sleepy, so he lay down by the roadside and closed his eyes.While he slept his brothers arrived and of course the first thing they saw was the golden cage and the Nightingale Gisar.Then envy and hatred filled their hearts and they began cursing and complaining to think that he who was the Youngest had succeeded where they had failed.“We’ll be the laughing-stock of the whole country!” they said, “if we let him come home carrying the Nightingale Gisar! Let us take the bird while he sleeps and hurry home with it. Then if he comes home later and says it was he who really found the bird no one will believe him.”So they beat their brother into insensibility and tore his clothes to rags to make him think that he had been set upon by robbers, and then taking the golden cage and the Nightingale Gisar they hurried home and presented themselves to their father, the Sultan.“Here, O father,” they said, “is the Nightingale Gisar! To get this glorious bird for you we have endured all the perils in the world!”“And your Youngest Brother,” the Sultan asked, “where is he?”“The Youngest? Think no more of him, father, for he is unworthy to be your son. Instead of searching the wide world for the Nightingale Gisar, he settled down in the first city he reached and lived a life of idleness and ease. Some say he became a barber and some say he opened a coffee-house and spent his days chatting with passing travelers. He has not come home with us for no doubt it shames him to know that we have succeeded where he has failed.”The Sultan was grieved to hear this evil report of his Youngest Son, but he was overjoyed to have the Nightingale Gisar. He had the golden cage carried to the mosque and hung beside the fountain in the court.But imagine his disappointment when the bird refused to sing!“Let him who found the Nightingale come to the mosque,” the Dervish said in his droning sing-song voice, “and then the Nightingale will sing.”The Sultan immediately sent for his two sons. They came but still the bird was silent.“See now,” the Sultan said, “my two sons are here and yet the bird is silent.”But the Dervish would only repeat:“Let him who found the Nightingale come to the mosque and then the Nightingale will sing.”The next day a youth in rags whom nobody knew entered the mosque to pray and instantly the Nightingale began to sing.A messenger was sent running to the Sultan with the news that the Nightingale was singing. The Sultan hurried to the mosque but by the time he got there the beggar youth was gone and the Nightingale had stopped singing.“Now that I’m here,” cried the Sultan, “why does the bird not sing?”The Dervish, swaying his body gently back and forth, made answer as before:“Let him who found the Nightingale come to the mosque and then the Nightingale will sing.”Thereafter every day when the beggar youth came to the mosque to pray the Nightingale sang, and always when the Sultan approached the beggar walked away and the bird stopped singing. At last people began whispering:“Strange that the Nightingale should sing only when that beggar youth is near! And yet the Dervish says it will not sing unless he who found it comes to the mosque! What can he mean?”Report of the beggar youth reached the ears of the Sultan and he went to the Dervish and questioned him.“Why do you say that the Nightingale Gisar will not sing unless he who found him comes to the mosque? Lo, here are my two sons who found him and the bird remains silent, yet people tell me that when a certain beggar comes to the mosque he sings. Why does he not sing when I and my two sons come to pray?”And always the Dervish made the same answer in the same sing-song voice:“Let him who found the Nightingale come to the mosque and then the Nightingale will sing.”Soon a terrifying rumor spread through the land that a great Warrior Princess called Flower o’ the World was coming with a mighty army to make war on the Sultan and to destroy his city. Her army far outnumbered the Sultan’s and when she encamped in a broad valley over against the city the Sultan’s people, seeing her mighty hosts, were filled with dread and besought their ruler to make peace with the Princess at any cost. So the Sultan called his heralds and sent them to her and through them he said:“Demand of me what you will even to my life but spare my city.”The Warrior Princess returned this answer:“I will spare you and your city provided you deliver me your son who stole from me the Nightingale Gisar. Him I shall have executed or let live as it pleases me.”Now the Sultan’s two sons knew that the Flower o’ the World was fated to marry the man who had stolen from her the Nightingale Gisar, so when they heard the Princess’s demand they were overjoyed thinking that she would have to fall in love with one of them. So they disputed at great length as to which of them had done the actual deed of taking the bird, each insisting that it was he and not his brother. The Sultan himself had finally to decide between them.“You have told me,” he said, “that you captured the bird together. As that is the case and as I can’t send you both to the Warrior Princess it is only right that the older should go.”So under a splendid escort the oldest son rode to the tent of the Warrior Princess. She bade him enter alone and when he appeared before her she looked at him long and steadily. Then she said:“Nay, but you are never the man who stole from me the Nightingale Gisar! You would lack the courage to face the perils of the way!”The oldest prince answered the Flower o’ the World craftily:“But how, Princess, if I did not steal from you the Nightingale Gisar was I then able to bring back that glorious bird and hang his cage beside the fountain in the mosque?”But Flower o’ the World was not to be deceived by such specious words.“Tell me then,” she said, “if it was you who stole my glorious Nightingale, where did you find him hanging in his golden cage?”The oldest prince could not answer this, so he said at random:“I found his golden cage hanging in the cypress tree that grows in the garden of your palace.”“Enough!” cried the Princess.She clapped her hands and when her guards appeared she said to them:“Have this man executed at once and let his head be sent to the Sultan with the message: This is the head of a liar and a coward! Send me at once your son who stole my glorious Nightingale Gisar or I will march against your city!”The Sultan was greatly shocked to receive this message together with the head of his oldest son.“Alas!” he cried, calling his second son, “would that I had listened to you when you insisted that it was you and not your brother who actually did the deed! Unhappily I listened to your brother! See now the awful result of this mistake! Go you now to this heartless Princess whom men call Flower o’ the World or else our poor defenseless city will have to pay the penalty.”So the second prince was taken to the tent of the Warrior Maiden and she put to him the same questions and he fared even worse than his brother had fared. So his head, too, was sent to the Sultan with this message:“Send me no more liars and cowards but the son who actually did steal from me my glorious Nightingale Gisar.”In despair the Sultan went to the mosque to pray. As he bowed his head he heard the Nightingale burst forth in song. Then when he looked up he saw a beggar youth standing near the fountain.When his prayers were finished the Sultan went outside to the Dervish and said to him:“The Warrior Princess, Flower o’ the World, demands that I send her another son. I know not where my Third Son is. What shall I do?”Without looking at the Sultan the Dervish answered in his sing-song voice:“Send her the son for whom the Nightingale sings.”The Sultan turned away in disappointment, not understanding what the Dervish meant, but one of his attendants plucked his sleeve and whispered:“The Nightingale sings for yonder beggar youth. Perhaps it is he the Dervish means. Why not ask him if he will go to Flower o’ the World in place of your Youngest Son?”The Sultan nodded, so the attendant called the beggar youth and the Sultan asked him would he go to the Warrior Princess as the Youngest Prince.“Allah alone knows where my Youngest Son is,” the Sultan said, “but he is just about your age and if you were washed and anointed and dressed in fitting garments you would not be unlike him.”The beggar youth said he would go but he insisted on going just as he was. The Sultan begged him to go dressed as a prince or the Flower o’ the World might not receive him.“No,” said the youth, “I shall go as a beggar or not at all. It is for the Flower o’ the World to know me whether or not I am the Sultan’s Youngest Son and the man who stole from her the Nightingale Gisar.”So he went as he was to the tent of the Flower o’ the World and her warriors when they saw him coming said to the Princess:“This Sultan mocks you and sends you a beggar when you demand his Third Son.”But the Flower o’ the World ordered them all out and bade the beggar enter alone. She looked at him long and steadily and she saw through his rags that he was indeed a noble youth with a body made strong and beautiful through exercise and toil and she thought to herself:“It were not a hard fate to marry this youth!”Then she questioned him:“Are you the Sultan’s Third Son?”“Then why are you dressed as a beggar?”“Because I was set upon at the crossroads and beaten insensible and my clothes torn to rags. I was coming home with the Nightingale Gisar in my hands and I lay down at the roadside to rest while I awaited the coming of my brothers. When I awoke to consciousness the Nightingale and its golden cage were gone. I came home to my father’s city as a beggar and there they told me that my brothers had come just before me bringing with them the Nightingale and boasting of the perils they had been through and the dangers they had faced. But the Nightingale, they told me, hanging in its golden cage beside the fountain, was silent. Yet when I went to the mosque it always sang.”The Warrior Princess looked deep into his eyes and knew that he was speaking truth. Her heart was touched with compassion at the wrong he had suffered from his brothers, but she hid her feelings and questioned him further.“Then it was you,” she said, “who really took from me my glorious Nightingale Gisar?”“Yes, Princess, it was. I crept past the lion and the wolf and the tiger just after midnight while they slept. I blew out the four candles at the head of your bed and lighted those at the foot. The golden cage of the Nightingale was hanging from a golden chain. Before I unfastened it I looked at you once, as you lay sleeping, and dared not look a second time.”“Why not?” the Princess asked.“Because, O Flower o’ the World, you were so beautiful that I feared, were I to look again, I should forget the Nightingale Gisar and cry out in ecstacy.”Then the compassion in the Princess’s heart changed to love and she knew for a certainty that this was the man she was fated to wed.She clapped her hands and when the guards came in she said to them:“Call my warriors together that I may show them the Sultan’s Youngest Son and the man who stole from me my glorious Nightingale Gisar and whom I am fated to wed.”So the warriors came in until they crowded the tent to its utmost. Then the Princess stood up and took the Sultan’s Youngest Son by the hand and presented him to the warriors and told them of his great bravery and courage and of all the perils he had endured in order to get the Nightingale Gisar for his father’s mosque.“He came to me now as a beggar,” she said, “but I knew him at once for truth was in his mouth and courage in his eye. Behold, O warriors, your future lord!”Then the warriors waved their swords and cried:“Long live the Flower o’ the World! Long live the Sultan’s Youngest Son!”All the Princess’s army when they heard the news raised such a mighty shout that the people in the Sultan’s city heard and were filled with dread not knowing what it meant. But soon they knew and then they, too, went mad with joy that what had threatened to be a war was turning to a wedding!The Flower o’ the World and her chief warriors and with them the Youngest Prince rode slowly to the city. The Prince was now dressed as befitted his rank and the Sultan when he saw him recognized him at once.“Allah be praised!” he cried, “my Youngest Son lives!”Then they told him all—how it was this Prince and not the older brothers who had found the Nightingale Gisar and how the older brothers had robbed him of his prize and beaten him insensible.When the Sultan heard how wicked his older sons had been his grief for their death was assuaged.“Allah be praised,” he said, “that I have at least one son who is worthy!”After the betrothal ceremony the Sultan and the Youngest Prince went to the mosque to pray. While they prayed the Nightingale sang so gloriously that it seemed to them they were no longer on earth but in Paradise.When their prayers were finished and they were passing out, the Dervish raised his sing-song voice and said:“Now indeed is the Sultan’s Mosque the most beautiful Mosque in the World for the Nightingale Gisar sings beside the Fountain!”","['weaver', 'erin', 'live', 'edge',

2873,slavic,The Story of Three Wonderful Beggars,"There once lived a merchant whose name was Mark, and whom people called ‘Mark the Rich.’ He was a very hard-hearted man, for he could not bear poor people, and if he caught sight of a beggar anywhere near his house, he would order the servants to drive him away, or would set the dogs at him.One day three very poor old men came begging to the door, and just as he was going to let the fierce dogs loose on them, his little daughter, Anastasia, crept close up to him and said:‘Dear daddy, let the poor old men sleep here to-night, do–to please me.’Her father could not bear to refuse her, and the three beggars were allowed to sleep in a loft, and at night, when everyone in the house was fast asleep, little Anastasia got up, climbed up to the loft, and peeped in.The three old men stood in the middle of the loft, leaning on their sticks, with their long grey beards flowing down over their hands, and were talking together in low voices.‘What news is there?’ asked the eldest.‘In the next village the peasant Ivan has just had his seventh son. What shall we name him, and what fortune shall we give him?’ said the second.The third whispered, ‘Call him Vassili, and give him all the property of the hard-hearted man in whose loft we stand, and who wanted to drive us from his door.’After a little more talk the three made themselves ready and crept softly away.Anastasia, who had heard every word, ran straight to her father, and told him all.Mark was very much surprised; he thought, and thought, and in the morning he drove to the next village to try and find out if such a child really had been born. He went first to the priest, and asked him about the children in his parish.‘Yesterday,’ said the priest, ‘a boy was born in the poorest house in the village. I named the unlucky little thing “Vassili.” He is the seventh son, and the eldest is only seven years old, and they hardly have a mouthful amongst them all. Who can be got to stand godfather to such a little beggar boy?’The merchant’s heart beat fast, and his mind was full of bad thoughts about that poor little baby. He would be godfather himself, he said, and he ordered a fine christening feast; so the child was brought and christened, and Mark was very friendly to its father. After the ceremony was over he took Ivan aside and said:‘Look here, my friend, you are a poor man. How can you afford to bring up the boy? Give him to me and I’ll make something of him, and I’ll give you a present of a thousand crowns. Is that a bargain?’Ivan scratched his head, and thought, and thought, and then he agreed. Mark counted out the money, wrapped the baby up in a fox skin, laid it in the sledge beside him, and drove back towards home. When he had driven some miles he drew up, carried the child to the edge of a steep precipice and threw it over, muttering, ‘There, now try to take my property!’Very soon after this some foreign merchants travelled along that same road on the way to see Mark and to pay the twelve thousand crowns which they owed him.As they were passing near the precipice they heard a sound of crying, and on looking over they saw a little green meadow wedged in between two great heaps of snow, and on the meadow lay a baby amongst the flowers.The merchants picked up the child, wrapped it up carefully, and drove on. When they saw Mark they told him what a strange thing they had found. Mark guessed at once that the child must be his godson, asked to see him, and said:‘That’s a nice little fellow; I should like to keep him. If you will make him over to me, I will let you off your debt.’The merchants were very pleased to make so good a bargain, left the child with Mark, and drove off.At night Mark took the child, put it in a barrel, fastened the lid tight down, and threw it into the sea. The barrel floated away to a great distance, and at last it floated close up to a monastery. The monks were just spreading out their nets to dry on the shore, when they heard the sound of crying. It seemed to come from the barrel which was bobbing about near the water’s edge. They drew it to land and opened it, and there was a little child! When the abbot heard the news, he decided to bring up the boy, and named him ‘Vassili.’The boy lived on with the monks, and grew up to be a clever, gentle, and handsome young man. No one could read, write, or sing better than he, and he did everything so well that the abbot made him wardrobe keeper.Now, it happened about this time that the merchant, Mark, came to the monastery in the course of a journey. The monks were very polite to him and showed him their house and church and all they had. When he went into the church the choir was singing, and one voice was so clear and beautiful, that he asked who it belonged to. Then the abbot told him of the wonderful way in which Vassili had come to them, and Mark saw clearly that this must be his godson whom he had twice tried to kill.He said to the abbot: ‘I can’t tell you how much I enjoy that young man’s singing. If he could only come to me I would make him overseer of all my business. As you say, he is so good and clever. Do spare him to me. I will make his fortune, and will present your monastery with twenty thousand crowns.’The abbot hesitated a good deal, but he consulted all the other monks, and at last they decided that they ought not to stand in the way of Vassili’s good fortune.Then Mark wrote a letter to his wife and gave it to Vassili to take to her, and this was what was in the letter: ‘When the bearer of this arrives, take him into the soap factory, and when you pass near the great boiler, push him in. If you don’t obey my orders I shall be very angry, for this young man is a bad fellow who is sure to ruin us all if he lives.’Vassili had a good voyage, and on landing set off on foot for Mark’s home. On the way he met three beggars, who asked him: ‘Where are you going, Vassili?’‘I am going to the house of Mark the Merchant, and have a letter for his wife,’ replied Vassili.‘Show us the letter.’Vassili handed them the letter. They blew on it and gave it back to him, saying: ‘Now go and give the letter to Mark’s wife. You will not be forsaken.’Vassili reached the house and gave the letter. When the mistress read it she could hardly believe her eyes and called for her daughter. In the letter was written, quite plainly: ‘When you receive this letter, get ready for a wedding, and let the bearer be married next day to my daughter, Anastasia. If you don’t obey my orders I shall be very angry.’Anastasia saw the bearer of the letter and he pleased her very much. They dressed Vassili in fine clothes and next day he was married to Anastasia.In due time, Mark returned from his travels. His wife, daughter, and son-in-law all went out to meet him. When Mark saw Vassili he flew into a terrible rage with his wife. ‘How dared you marry my daughter without my consent?’ he asked.‘I only carried out your orders,’ said she. ‘Here is your letter.’Mark read it. It certainly was his handwriting, but by no means his wishes.‘Well,’ thought he, ‘you’ve escaped me three times, but I think I shall get the better of you now.’ And he waited a month and was very kind and pleasant to his daughter and her husband.At the end of that time he said to Vassili one day, ‘I want you to go for me to my friend the Serpent King, in his beautiful country at the world’s end. Twelve years ago he built a castle on some land of mine. I want you to ask for the rent for those twelve years and also to find out from him what has become of my twelve ships which sailed for his country three years ago.’Vassili dared not disobey. He said good-bye to his young wife, who cried bitterly at parting, hung a bag of biscuits over his shoulders, and set out.I really cannot tell you whether the journey was long or short. As he tramped along he suddenly heard a voice saying: ‘Vassili! where are you going?’Vassili looked about him, and, seeing no one, called out: ‘Who spoke to me?’‘I did; this old wide-spreading oak. Tell me where you are going.’‘I am going to the Serpent King to receive twelve years’ rent from him.’‘When the time comes, remember me and ask the king: “Rotten to the roots, half dead but still green, stands the old oak. Is it to stand much longer on the earth?” ‘Vassili went on further. He came to a river and got into the ferryboat. The old ferryman asked: ‘Are you going far, my friend?’‘I am going to the Serpent King.’‘Then think of me and say to the king: “For thirty years the ferryman has rowed to and fro. Will the tired old man have to row much longer?” ‘‘Very well,’ said Vassili; ‘I’ll ask him.’And he walked on. In time he came to a narrow strait of the sea and across it lay a great whale over whose back people walked and drove as if it had been a bridge or a road. As he stepped on it the whale said, ‘Do tell me where you are going.’‘I am going to the Serpent King.’And the whale begged: ‘Think of me and say to the king: “The poor whale has been lying three years across the strait, and men and horses have nearly trampled his back into his ribs. Is he to lie there much longer?” ‘‘I will remember,’ said Vassili, and he went on.He walked, and walked, and walked, till he came to a great green meadow. In the meadow stood a large and splendid castle. Its white marble walls sparkled in the light, the roof was covered with mother o’ pearl, which shone like a rainbow, and the sun glowed like fire on the crystal windows. Vassili walked in, and went from one room to another astonished at all the splendour he saw.When he reached the last room of all, he found a beautiful girl sitting on a bed.As soon as she saw him she said: ‘Oh, Vassili, what brings you to this accursed place?’Vassili told her why he had come, and all he had seen and heard on the way.The girl said: ‘You have not been sent here to collect rents, but for your own destruction, and that the serpent may devour you.’She had not time to say more, when the whole castle shook, and a rustling, hissing, groaning sound was heard. The girl quickly pushed Vassili into a chest under the bed, locked it and whispered: ‘Listen to what the serpent and I talk about.’Then she rose up to receive the Serpent King.The monster rushed into the room, and threw itself panting on the bed, crying: ‘I’ve flown half over the world. I’m tired, VERY tired, and want to sleep–scratch my head.’The beautiful girl sat down near him, stroking his hideous head, and said in a sweet coaxing voice: ‘You know everything in the world. After you left, I had such a wonderful dream. Will you tell me what it means?’‘Out with it then, quick! What was it?’‘I dreamt I was walking on a wide road, and an oak tree said to me: “Ask the king this: Rotten at the roots, half dead, and yet green stands the old oak. Is it to stand much longer on the earth?” ‘‘It must stand till some one comes and pushes it down with his foot. Then it will fall, and under its roots will be found more gold and silver than even Mark the Rich has got.’‘Then I dreamt I came to a river, and the old ferryman said to me: “For thirty year’s the ferryman has rowed to and fro. Will the tired old man have to row much longer?” ‘‘That depends on himself. If some one gets into the boat to be ferried across, the old man has only to push the boat off, and go his way without looking back. The man in the boat will then have to take his place.’‘And at last I dreamt that I was walking over a bridge made of a whale’s back, and the living bridge spoke to me and said: “Here have I been stretched out these three years, and men and horses have trampled my back down into my ribs. Must I lie here much longer?” ‘‘He will have to lie there till he has thrown up the twelve ships of Mark the Rich which he swallowed. Then he may plunge back into the sea and heal his back.’And the Serpent King closed his eyes, turned round on his other side, and began to snore so loud that the windows rattled.In all haste the lovely girl helped Vassili out of the chest, and showed him part of his way back. He thanked her very politely, and hurried off.When he reached the strait the whale asked: ‘Have you thought of me?’‘Yes, as soon as I am on the other side I will tell you what you want to know.’When he was on the other side Vassili said to the whale: ‘Throw up those twelve ships of Mark’s which you swallowed three years ago.’The great fish heaved itself up and threw up all the twelve ships and their crews. Then he shook himself for joy, and plunged into the sea.Vassili went on further till he reached the ferry, where the old man asked: ‘Did you think of me?’‘Yes, and as soon as you have ferried me across I will tell you what you want to know.’When they had crossed over, Vassili said: ‘Let the next man who comes stay in the boat, but do you step on shore, push the boat off, and you will be free, and the other man must take your place.Then Vassili went on further still, and soon came to the old oak tree, pushed it with his foot, and it fell over. There, at the roots, was more gold and silver than even Mark the Rich had.And now the twelve ships which the whale had thrown up came sailing along and anchored close by. On the deck of the first ship stood the three beggars whom Vassili had met formerly, and they said: ‘Heaven has blessed you, Vassili.’ Then they vanished away and he never saw them again.The sailors carried all the gold and silver into the ship, and then they set sail for home with Vassili on board.Mark was more furious than ever. He had his horses harnessed and drove off himself to see the Serpent King and to complain of the way in which he had been betrayed. When he reached the river he sprang into the ferryboat. The ferryman, however, did not get in but pushed the boat off. . . .Vassili led a good and happy life with his dear wife, and his kind mother-in-law lived with them. He helped the poor and fed and clothed the hungry and naked and all Mark’s riches became his.For many years Mark has been ferrying people across the river. His face is wrinkled, his hair and beard are snow white, and his eyes are dim; but still he rows on.","['upon', 'time', 'something', 'happen', 'happen', 'would', 'told', 'fisherman', 'neither',

2878,slavic,The Journey of the Sun and the Moon,"There were once two young people who loved each other dearly. The young man was called Jean, the girl, Annette. In her sweetness she was like unto a dove, in her strength and bravery she resembled an eagle.Her father was a rich farmer, and owned a large estate, but Jean’s father was only a poor mountain shepherd. Annette did not in the least mind her lover being poor, for he was rich in goodness: nor did she think her father would object to their marrying.One day Jean put on his best clothes, and went to ask the farmer for his daughter’s hand. The farmer listened without interrupting him, and then replied, “If you would marry Annette, go and ask of the Sun why he does not warm the night as well as the day. Then inquire of the Moon why she does not shine by day as well as by night. When you return with these answers you shall not only have my daughter but all my wealth.”These conditions in no way daunted Jean, who placed his hat on the side of his head, and taking a loving farewell of Annette, set out in search of the Sun. On reaching a small town at the close of day, he looked about for a place wherein to pass the night. Some kind people offered him shelter and invited him to sup with them, inquiring as to the object of his journey. When they heard that he was on his way to visit the Sun and Moon, the master of the house begged him to ask the Sun why the finest pear-tree they had in the town had, for several years, ceased to bear fruit, for it used to produce the most delicious pears in the world.Jean willingly promised to make this inquiry, and the next day continued his journey.He walked on and on, over mountain and moor, through valley and dense forest, until he came to a land where there was no drinking water. The inhabitants, when they heard the object of Jean’s journey, begged him to ask the Sun and Moon why a well, that was the chief water supply of the district, no longer gave good water. Jean promised to do so, and resumed his journey.After long and weary wanderings he reached the Sun’s abode, and found him about to start on his travels.“O Sun,” said he, “stop one moment, do not depart without first answering a few questions.”“Be quick then and speak, for I have to go all round the world to-day.”“Pray tell me why you do not warm or light the earth by night as well as day?”“For this simple reason, that if I did, the world and everything upon it would be very soon burnt up.”Jean then put his questions concerning the pear-tree and the well. But the Sun replied that his sister, the Moon, would be able to answer him on those points.Hardly had the Sun finished speaking before he was obliged to hurry off, and Jean travelled far and fast to meet the Moon. On coming up to her he said, “Would you kindly stop one moment? there are a few questions I should like to ask you.”“Very well, be quick, for the earth is waiting for me,” answered she, and stood still at once.“Tell me, dear Moon, why you do not light the world by day as well as by night? And why you never warm it?”“Because if I lit up the world by day as well as by night the plants would produce neither fruit nor flower. And though I do not warm the earth, I supply it with dew, which makes it fertile and fruitful.”She was then about to continue her course, but Jean, begging her to stop one moment longer, questioned her about the pear-tree which had ceased to bear fruit.And she answered him thus: “While the king’s eldest daughter remained unmarried the tree bore fruit every year. After her wedding she had a little child who died and was buried under this tree. Since then there has been neither fruit nor flower on its branches: if the child be given Christian burial the tree will produce blossom and fruit as in the past.”The Moon was just moving off when Jean begged her to stop and answer one more question, which was, why the inhabitants of a certain land were unable to obtain from their well the clear and wholesome water it had formerly poured forth.She replied: “Under the mouth of the well, just where the water should flow, lies an enormous toad which poisons it continually: the brim of the well must be broken and the toad killed, then the water will be as pure and wholesome as formerly.”The Moon then resumed her journey, for Jean had no more questions to ask her.He joyfully went back to claim his Annette, but forgot not to stop on coming to the land where they were short of water. The inhabitants ran out to meet him, anxious to know what he had found out.Jean led them to the well and there explained the instructions he had received from the Moon, at the same time showing them what to do. Sure enough, right underneath the brim of the well they found a horrible toad which poisoned everything. When they had killed it, the water immediately became pure and transparent, and sweet to the taste as before.All the people brought Jean presents, and thus laden with riches he again set out. On arriving at the town where grew the unfruitful pear-tree, he was warmly welcomed by the prince, who at once asked if he had forgotten to question the stars about the tree.“I never forget a promise once made,” replied Jean, “but I doubt whether it will be agreeable to your majesty to know the cause of the evil.”He then related all the Moon had said, and when his directions had been carried out they were rewarded by seeing the tree blossom immediately. Jean was loaded with rich gifts, and the king presented him with a most valuable horse, by means of which he reached home very quickly.Little Annette was wild with joy on hearing of her lover’s safe return, for she had wept and suffered much during his absence. But her father’s feelings were very different; he wished never to see Jean again, and had, indeed, sent him in search of the Sun with the hope that he might be burnt up by the heat. True it is that “Man proposes and God disposes.” Our young shepherd returned, not only safe and sound, but with more knowledge than any of his evil-wishers. For he had learnt why the Sun neither lights nor warms the earth by night as in the day; also why the Moon does not give warmth, and only lights up during the night. Besides all this he had brought with him riches which far exceeded those of his father-in-law, and a steed full of fire and vigour.So Annette’s father could find no fault, and the wedding was celebrated with joy and feasting. Large quantities of roasted crane were eaten, and glasses overflowing with mead were emptied. So beautiful, too, was the music, that for long, long after it was heard to echo among the mountains, and even now its sweet sounds are heard at times by travellers among those regions.","['upon',
