174,hawaiian,"Hina, the Woman in the Moon","A weary woman was Hina, and as the years grew on her she grew more and more weary. All day she sat outside her house beating out tapas for clothes for her family, making cloths out of the bark of a tree by beating it on a board with a mallet. Weary indeed was Hina with making tapas all the day outside her house. And when she might see no more to beat out the tapas , she would have to get her calabash and bring water to the house. Often she would stumble in the dark, coming back with her calabash of water. There was no one in her house to help her. Her son went sailing from island to island, robbing people, and her daughter went to live with the wild people in the forest. Her husband had become bad tempered, and he was always striving to make her do more and more work.As Hina grew old she longed more and more to go to a place where she might sit and rest herself. And one day, when she was given a new task and was sent to fish up shrimps amongst the rocks with a net, she cried out, “Oh, that I might go away from this place, and to a place where I might stay and rest myself.”“It made an arching path for her from the rocks up to the heavens. With the net in her hands she went along that path.” Illustration by Juliette May Fraser, published in At the Gateways of the Day by Padraic Colum (1924), Oxford University Press.The Rainbow heard Hina and had pity on her. It made an arching path for her from the rocks up to the heavens. With the net in her hands she went along that path. She thought she would go up to the heavens and then over to the Sun, and that she would go into the Sun and rest herself there.She went higher and higher along the arch of the Rainbow. But as she went on, the rays of the Sun beat on her more and more strongly. She held the net over her head and went on and on. But when she went beyond the clouds and there was nothing to shelter her, the rays of the Sun burnt her terribly. On and on she went, but as she went higher she could only crawl along the path. Then the fire of the Sun’s rays began to torture her and shrivel her. She could go no farther, and, slipping back along the Rainbow arch, she came to earth again.It was dark now. She stood outside her house and saw her husband coming back from the pool with a calabash of water, stumbling and saying ill-tempered words about her. And when she showed herself to him he scolded because she had not been there to bring the calabash of water to the house.Now that the Sun was gone down and his rays were no longer upon her , her strength came back to Hina. She looked up into the sky , and she saw the full Moon there, and she said: “To the Moon I will go. It is very quiet, and there I can sit for a long, long time and rest myself. ”But first she went into the house for the calabash that held all the things that on earth were precious to her. She came out of her house carrying the calabash, and there before her door was a moon-rainbow.Her husband came and asked her where she was going; because she carried her calabash he knew she was going far. “I am going to the Moon, to a place where I can rest myself, ” she said. She began to climb along the arch of the Rainbow. And now she was almost out of her husband’ s reach. But he sprang up and caught her foot in his hand. He fell back, twisting and breaking her foot as he fell.But Hina went on. She was lamed, and she was filled with pain; and yet she rejoiced as she went along through the quiet night. On and on she went. She came to where the Stars were, and she said incantations to them, that they might show her how to come to the Moon. And the Stars showed her the way, and she came at last to the Moon.She came to the Moon with the calabash that had her precious possessions; and the Moon gave her a place where she might rest. There Hina stayed  And the people of Hawaii can look up to the bright Moon and see her there. She sits, her foot lamed, and with her calabash by her side. Seeing her there, the people call her, not “ Hina ” any more, but “Lono Moku” — that is, “Lame Lono.”And standing outside the door you can see her now — Hina, the Woman in the Moon. But some say that , instead of the calabash , she took with her her tapa-board and mallet; and they say that the fine fleecy clouds that you see around the Moon are really the fine tapa-cloths that Hina beats out.","['weary', 'woman', 'hina', 'year', 'grow', 'grow', 'weary', 'outside', 'house', 'beating', 'tapa', 'clothes', 'family', 'make', 'cloth', 'bark', 'tree', 'beating', 'board', 'mallet',

411,hawaiian,The Seven Great Deeds of Ma-ui: How Ma-ui Won a Place for Himself in the House,"There is no hero who is more famous than Ma-uí. In all the Islands of the Great Ocean, from Kahiki mo-e to Hawaii nei , his name and his deeds are spoken of. His deeds were many, but seven of them were very great, and it is about those seven great deeds that I shall tell you.How Ma – ui won a place for himself in the House.When Ma-ui, the last of her five sons, was born, his mother thought she would have no food for him. So she took him down to the shore of the sea, she cut off her hair and tied it around him, and she gave him to the waves . But Ma-ui was not drowned in the sea: first of all the jelly-fish came; it folded him in its softness, and it kept him warm while he floated on. And then the God of the Sea found the child and took charge of him: he brought him to his house and warmed and cherished him, and little Ma-ui grew up in the land where lived the God of the Sea.But while he was still a boy he went back to his mother’s country. He saw his mother and his four brothers, and he followed them into a house; it was a house that all the people of the country were going into. He sat there with his brothers. And when his mother called her children to take them home, she found this strange child with them. She did not know him, and she would not take him with the rest of the children. But Ma-ui followed them. And when his four brothers came out of their own house they found him there, and he played with them. At first they played hide – and – seek, but then they made themselves spears from canes and began throwing the spears at the house.The slight spears did not go through the thatch of grass that was at the outside of the house. And then Ma-ui made a charm over the cane that was his spear — a charm that toughened it and made it heavy. He flung it again, and a great hole was made in the grass – thatch of the house. His mother came out to chastise the boy and drive him away. But when she stood at the door and saw him standing there so angry, and saw how he was able to break down the house with the throws of his spear, she knew in him the great power that his father had, and she called to him to come into the house. He would not come in until she had laid her hands upon him. When she did this his brothers were jealous that their mother made so much of this strange boy, and they did not want to have him with them. It was then that the elder brother spoke and said, “Never mind; let him be with us and be our dear brother.” And then they all asked him to come into the house.The door-posts, Short Post and Tall Post, that had been put there to guard the house, would not let him come in. Then Ma-ui lifted up his spear, and he threw it at Tall Post and overthrew him. He threw his spear again and overthrew Short Post. And after that he went into his mother’s house and was with his brothers. The overthrowing of the two posts that guarded the house was the first of the great deeds of Ma-ui.In those days, say the people who know the stories of the old times, the birds were not seen by the men and women of the Islands. They flew around the houses, and the flutter of their wings was heard, and the stirring of the branches and the leaves as they were lit upon. Then there would be music. But the people who had never seen the birds thought that this was music made by gods who wanted to remain unseen by the people. Ma-ui could see the birds; he rejoiced in their brilliant colors, and when he called to them they would come and rest upon the branches around the place where he was; there they would sing their happiest songs to him.There was a visitor who came from another land to the country that Ma-ui lived in. He boasted of all the wonderful things that were in his country, and it seemed to the people of Ma-ui’s land that they had nothing that was fine or that could be spoken about. Then Ma-ui called to the birds. They came and they made music on every side. The visitor who had boasted so much was made to wonder, and he said that there was nothing in his country that was so marvellous as the music made by Ma-ui’s friends, the birds. Then, that they might be honored by all, Ma-ui said a charm by which the birds came to be seen by men—the red birds, the i-i-wi and the aha-hani, and the yellow birds, the o-o and the mamo, and all the other bright birds. The delight of seeing them was equal to the delight of hearing the music that they made. Ever afterwards the birds were seen and heard, and the people all rejoiced in them. This Ma-ui did when he was still a boy growing up with his brothers and with his sister in his mother’s house. But this is not counted amongst the great deeds of Ma-ui the hero.The legends of Ma-ui continue in How Ma-ui Lifted Up the Sky.","['hero', 'famous', 'ma-uí', 'island', 'great', 'ocean', 'kahiki',

1126,hawaiian,The Boy Pu-nia and the King of the Sharks,"On one side of the Island there lived a great shark: Kai-ale-ale he was named; he was the King of the Sharks of that place, and he had ten shaks under him. He lived near a cave that was filled with lobsters. But no one dared to dive down, and go into that cave, and take lobsters out of it, on account of Kai-ale-ale and the ten sharks he had under him; they stayed around the cave night and day, and if a diver ventured near they would bite him and devour him.There was a boy named Pu-nia, whose father had been killed by the sharks. Now after his father had been killed, there was no one to catch fish for Pu- nia and his mother; they had sweet potatoes to eat, but they never had any fish to eat with them. Often Pu-nia heard his mother say that she wished she had a fish or lobster to eat with the sweet potatoes. He made up his mind that they should have lobsters.He came above the cave where the lobsters were. Looking down he saw the sharks — Kai-ale-ale and his ten sharks; they were all asleep. While he was watching them, they wakened up. Pu-nia pretended that he did not know that the sharks had wakened. He spoke loudly so that they would hear him, and he said: “Here am I, Pu-nia , and I am going into the cave to get lobsters for myself and my mother. That great shark , Kai- ale-ale, is asleep now, and I can dive to the point over there, and then go into the cave; I will take two lobsters in my hands, and my mother and I will have something to eat with our sweet potatoes. ” So Pu-nia said, speaking loudly and pretending that he thought the sharks were still asleep .Said Kai-ale-ale, speaking softly to the other sharks: “Let us rush to the place where Pu-nia dives, and let us devour him as we devoured his father. ” But Pu-nia was a very cunning boy and not at all the sort that could be caught by the stupid sharks. He had a stone upon his hand while he was speaking, and he flung it towards the point that he said he was going to dive to. Just as soon as the stone struck the water the sharks made a rush to the place, leaving the cave of the lobsters unguarded. Then Pu-nia dived. He went into the cave, took two lobsters in his hands, and came up on the place that he had spoken from before.He shouted down to the sharks: “Here is Pu-nia, and he has come back safely. He has two lobsters, and he and his mother have something to live on. It was the first shark, the second shark, the third shark, the fourth shark, the fifth shark, the sixth shark, the seventh shark, the eighth shark, the ninth shark, the tenth shark – it was the tenth shark, the one with the thin tail, that showed Pu-nia what to do. ”When the King of the Sharks, Kai- ale-ale, heard this from Pu-nia, he ordered all the sharks to come together and stay in a row. He counted them, and there were ten of them, and the tenth one had a thin tail. “So it was you, Thin Tail, ” he said,” that told the boy Pu-nia what to do. You shall die.” Then, according to the orders of Kai-ale-ale, the thin tailed shark was killed. Pu-nia called out to them, “You have killed one of your own kind. ” With the two lobsters in his hands, he went back to his mother’s.Pu-nia and his mother now had something to eat with their sweet potatoes. And when the lobsters were all eaten, Pu-nia went back to the place above the cave. He called out, the same as he had done the first time: “I can dive to the place over there and then slip into the cave, for the sharks are all asleep; I can get two lobsters for myself and my mother, so that we’ll have something to eat with our sweet potatoes. ” Then he threw down a stone and made ready to dive to another point.When the stone struck the water the sharks rushed over, leaving the cave unguarded. Then Pu-nia dived down and went into the cave. He took two lobsters in his hands and got back to the top of the water , and when he got to the place that he had spoken from before, he shouted down to the sharks: “It was the first shark, the second shark, the third shark, the fourth shark , the fifth shark, the sixth shark, the seventh shark, the eighth shark, the ninth shark — it was the ninth shark, the one with the big stomach, that told Pu-nia what to do. ”Then the King of the Sharks, Kai- ale-ale , or dered the sharks to get into a line. He counted them , and he found that the ninth shark had a big stomach. “So it was you that told Pu-nia what to do, ” he said; and he ordered the big-stomached shark to be killed. After that Pu-nia went home with his two lobsters, and he and his mother had something to eat with their sweet potatoes.Pu-nia continued to do this. He would deceive the sharks by throwing a stone to the place that he said he was going to dive to; when he got the sharks away from the cave, he would dive down, slip in, and take two lobsters in his hands. And always, when he got to the top of the water, he would name a shark. “The first shark, the second shark, the third shark the shark with the little eye, the shark with the grey spot on him — told Pu-nia what to do,” he would say; and each time he would get one of the sharks killed. He kept on doing this until only one of the sharks was left; this one was Kai-ale-ale, the King of the Sharks .After that, Pu-nia went into the forest ; he hewed out two hard pieces of wood, each about a yard long; then he took sticks for lighting a fire — the au-li -ma to rub with, and the au-na-ki to rub on; he got charcoal to burn as a fire, and he got food. He put all into a bag , and he carried the bag down to the beach. He came above the cave that Kai-ale-ale was watching, and he said, speaking in a loud voice: “If I dive now, and if Kai-ale-ale bites me, my blood will come to the top of the water, and my mother will see the blood and will bring me back to life again. But if I dive down and Kai-ale-ale takes me into his mouth whole, I shall die and never come back to life again. ”Kai-ale-ale was listening, of course. He said to himself: “No, I will not bite you, you cunning boy; I will take you into my mouth and swallow you whole, and then you will never come back to life again. I shall open my mouth wide enough to take you in. Yes, indeed, this time I will get you. ”Pu-nia dived, holding his bag. Kai-ale-ale opened his mouth wide and got Pu – nia into it. But as soon as the boy got within, he opened his bag and took out the two pieces of wood which he had hewn out in the forest. He put them between the jaws of the shark so that Kai-ale-ale was not able to close his jaws. With his mouth held open, Kai-ale-ale went dashing through the water.Pu-nia was now inside the big shark; he took the fire-sticks out of his bag and rubbed them together, making a fire. He kindled the charcoal that he had brought, and he cooked his food at the fire that he had made. With the fire in his insides, the shark could not keep still; he went dashing here and there through the ocean.At last the shark came near the Island of Hawaii again. “If he brings me near the breakers, I am saved, ” said Pu-nia , speaking aloud; ” but if he takes me to the sand near where the grass grows, I shall die; I cannot be saved. ” Kai- ale-ale, when he heard Pu-nia say this, said to himself: “I will not take him near the breakers; I will take him where the dry sand is, near the grass. ” Saying this, he dashed in from the ocean and up to where the shrubs grew on the shore. No shark had ever gone there before; and when Kai- ale-ale got there, he could not get back again.Then Pu-nia came out of the shark. He shouted out, “ Kai-ale-ale, Kai-ale – ale, the King of the Sharks, has come to visit us. ” And the people, hearing about their enemy Kai-ale-ale, came down to the shore with their spears and their knives and killed him. And that was the end of the ugly and wicked King of the Sharks.Every day after that, Pu-nia was able to go down into the cave and get lobsters for himself and his mother. And all the people rejoiced when they knew that the eleven sharks that guarded the cave had been got rid of by the boy Pu-nia.","['side', 'island', 'live', 'great', 'shark', 'kai-ale-ale', 'name',

2459,hawaiian,The Seven Great Deeds of Ma-ui: How Ma-ui Snared the Sun and Made Him Go More Slowly Across the Heavens,"The Sky had been lifted up, and another great Island had come from the grip of Old One Tooth and was above the waters. The world was better now for men and women to live in. But still there were miseries in it, and the greatest of these miseries was on account of the heedlessness of the Sun. For the Sun in those days made his way too quickly across the world. He hurried so that little of his heat got to the plants and the fruits, and it took years and years for them to ripen. The farmers working on their patches would not have time in the light of a day to put down their crop into the ground so quickly the Sun would rush across the heavens, and the fishermen would barely have time to launch their canoes and get to the fishing grounds when the darkness would come on. And the women’s tasks were never finished. It was theirs to make the tapa-cloth: a woman would begin at one end of the board to beat the bark with her four-sided mallet, and she would be only at the middle of the board by the time the sunset came. When she was ready to go on with the work next day, the Sun would be already halfway across the heavens. Ma-ui, when he was a child, used to watch his mother making tapa, and as he grew up he pitied her more and more because of all the toil and trouble that she had. She would break the branches from the ma-ma-ka trees and from the wau-ke trees and soak them in water until their bark was easily taken off. Then she would take off the outer bark, leaving the inner bark to be worked upon. She would take the bundles of the wet inner bark and lay them on the tapa-board and begin pounding them with little clubs. And then she would use her four-sided mallet and beat all the soft stuff into little thin sheets. Then she would paste the little sheets together, making large cloths. This was tapa—the tapa that it was every woman’s business in those days to make. As soon as morning reddened the clouds Ma- ui’s mother, Hina-of-the-Fire, would begin her task: she would begin beating the softened bark at one end of the board, and she would be only in the middle of the board when the sunset came. And when she managed to get the tapa made she could never get it dried in a single day, so quickly the Sun made his way across the heavens. Ma-ui pitied his mother because of her unceasing toil. He greatly blamed the Sun for his inconsiderate- ness of the people of the world. He took to watching the Sun. He began to know the path by which the Sun came over the great mountain Ha-le-a- ka-la (but in those days it was not called Ha-le-a- ka-la, the House of the Sun, but A-hele-a-ka-la, The Rays of the Sun). Through a great chasm in the side of this mountain the Sun used to come. He told his mother that he was going to do some- thing to make the Sun have more considerateness for the men and women of the world. “You will not be able to make him do anything about it,” she said; “the Sun always went swiftly, and he will always go swiftly.” But Ma-ui said that he would find a way to make the Sun remember that there were people in the world and that they were not at all pleased with the way he was going on. Then his mother said: “If you are going to force the Sun to go more slowly you must prepare your- self for a great battle, for the Sun is a great creature, and he has much energy. Go to your grand- mother who lives on the side of Ha-le-a-ka-la,” said she (but it was called A-hele-a-ka-la then), “and beg her to give you her counsel, and also to give you a weapon to battle with the Sun.” So Ma-ui went to his grandmother who lived on the side of the great mountain. Ma-ui’s grandmother was the one who cooked the bananas that the Sun ate as he came through the great chasm in the mountain. “You must go to the place where there is a large wili-wili tree growing,” said his mother. “There the Sun stops to eat the bananas that your grandmother cooks for him. Stay until the rooster that watches beside the wili-wili tree crows three times. Your grandmother will come out then with a bunch of bananas. When she lays them down, do you take them up. She will bring another bunch out, and do you take that up too. When all her bananas are gone she will search for the one who took them. Then do you show yourself to her. Tell her that you are Ma-ui and that you belong to Hina-of-the- Fire.” So Ma-ui went up the side of the mountain that is now called He-le-a-ka-la, but that then was called A-hele-a-ka-la, The Rays of the Sun. He came to where a great wili-wili tree was growing. There he waited. The rooster crew three times, and then an old woman came out with a bunch of bananas. He knew that this was his grandmother. She laid the bananas down to cook them, and as she did so Ma-ui snatched them away. When she went to pick up the bunch she cried out, “Where are the bananas that I have to cook for my Lord, the Sun?” She went within and got another bunch, and this one, too, Ma-ui snatched away. This he did until the last bunch of bananas that his grandmother had was taken. She was nearly blind, so she could not find him with her eyes. She sniffed around, and at last she got the smell of a man. “Who are you?” she said. “I am Ma-ui, and I belong to Hina-of-the-Fire,” said he. “What have you come for?” asked his grandmother. “I have come to chastise the Sun and to make him go more slowly across the heavens. He goes so fast now that my mother cannot dry the tapa that she takes all the days of the year to beat out.” The old woman considered all that Ma-ui said to her. She knew that he was a hero born, because the birds sang, the pebbles rumbled, the grass withered, the smoke hung low, the rainbow appeared, the thunder was heard, the hairless dogs were seen, and even the ants in the grass were heard to sing in his praise. She decided to give help to him. And she told him what preparations he was to make for his battle with the Sun. First of all he was to get sixteen of the strongest ropes that ever were made. So as to be sure they were the strongest, he was to knit them himself. And he was to make nooses for them out of the hair of the head of his sister, Hina-of-the-Sea. When the ropes were ready he was to come back to her, and she would show him what else he had to do. Ma-ui made the sixteen ropes; he made them out of the strongest fibre, and his sister, Hina-of-the- Sea, gave him the hair of her head to make into nooses. Then, with the ropes and the nooses upon them, Ma-ui went back to his grandmother. She told him where to set the nooses, and she gave him a magic stone axe with which to do battle with the Sun. He set the nooses as snares for the Sun, and he dug a hole beside the roots of the wili-wili tree, and in that hole he hid himself. Soon the first ray of light, the first leg of the Sun, came over the mountain wall. It was caught in one of the nooses that Ma-ui had set. One by one the legs of the Sun came over the rim, and one by one they were caught in the nooses. One leg was left hanging down the side of the mountain: it was hard for the Sun to move that leg. At last this last leg came slowly over the edge of the mountain and was caught in the snare. Then Ma-ui gathered up the ropes and tied them to the great wili-wili tree. When the Sun saw that his sixteen legs were held fast by the nooses that Ma-ui had set he tried to back down the mountain-side and into the sea again But the ropes held him, and the wili-wili tree stood the drag of the ropes. The Sun could not get away. Then he turned all his burning strength upon  fought. The man began to strike at the Sun with his magic axe of stone; and never before did the Sun get such a beating. “Give me my life,” said the Sun. “I will give you your life,” said Ma-ui, “if you promise to go slowly across the heavens.” At last the Sun promised to do what Ma-ui asked him. They entered into an agreement with each other, Ma-ui and the Sun. There should be longer days, the Sun making his course slower. But every six months, in the winter, the Sun might go as fast as he had been in the habit of going. Then Ma-ui let the Sun out of the snares which he had set for him. But, lest he should ever forget the agreement he had made and take to travelling swiftly again, Ma-ui left all the ropes and the nooses on the side of Ha- le-a-ka-la, so that he might see them every day that he came across the rim of the mountain. And the mountain was not called A-hele-a-ka-la, the Rays of the Sun, any more, but Ha-le-a-ka-la, the House of the Sun. After that came the saying of the people, “Long shall be the daily journey of the Sun, and he shall give light for all the peoples’ toil.” And Ma-ui’s mother, Hina-of-the-Fire, learned that she could pound on the tapa-board until she was tired, and the farmers could plant and take care of their crops, and the fishermen could go out to the deep sea and fish and come back, and the fruits and the plants got heat enough to make them ripen in their season.

2797,hawaiian,The Seven Great Deeds of Ma-ui: How Ma-ui Lifted Up the Sky,"Then he lifted up the sky to where it is now. This was the second of Ma-ui’s great deeds. When he was growing up in his mother’s house the sky was so low that the trees touched it and had their leaves flattened out. Men and women burned with the heat because the sky was so near to them. The clouds were so close that there was much dark- ness on the earth. Something had to be done about it, and Ma-ui made up his mind that he would lift up the sky. Somewhere he got a mark tattooed on his arm that was a magic mark and that gave him great strength. Then he went to lift up the sky. And from some woman he got a drink that made his strength greater. “Give me to drink out of your gourd,” he said, “and I will push up the sky.” The woman gave him her gourd to drink from. Then Ma-ui pushed at the sky. He lifted it high, to where the trees have their tops now. He pushed at it again, and he put it where the mountains have their tops now. And then he pushed it to where it rests, on the tops of the highest mountains. Then the men and women were able to walk about all over the earth, and they had light now and clear air. The trees grew higher and higher, and they grew more and more fruit. But even to this day their leaves are flattened out: it is from the time when their leaves were flattened against the sky. When the sky was lifted up Ma-ui went and made a kite for himself. From his mother he got the largest and strongest piece of tapa-cloth she had ever made, and he formed it into a kite with a frame. and cross-sticks of hau wood. The tail of the kite was fifteen fathoms long, and he got a line of olona vine for it that was twenty times forty fathoms in length. He started the kite. But it rose very slowly; the wind barely held it up. Then the people said: “Look at Ma-ui! He lifted the sky up, and now he can’t fly a kite.” Ma-ui was made angry when he heard them say this: he drew the kite this way and that way, but still he was not able to make it rise up. He cried out his incantation- “Strong wind, come; Soft wind, come”- but still the kite would not rise. Then he remembered that in the Valley of Wai- pio there was a wizard who had control of the winds. Over the mountains and down into the valley Ma-ui went. He saw the calabash that the wizard kept the winds in, and he asked him to loose them and direct them to blow along the river to the place where he was going to fly his kite. Then Ma-ui went back. He stood with his feet upon the rocks along the bank of the Wai-lu-ku River; he stood there braced to hold his kite, and where he stood are the marks of his feet to this day. He called out: “O winds, winds of Wai-pio, Come from the calabash—the Calabash of perpetual winds.’ O wind, O wind of Hilo, Come quickly; come with power.” The call that Ma-ui gave went across the mountains and down into the valley of Wai-pio. No sooner did he hear it than the wizard opened his calabash. The winds rushed out. They went into the bay of Hilo, and they dashed themselves against the water. The call of Ma-ui came to them: “O winds, winds of Hilo, Hurry, hurry and come to me.” The winds turned from the sea. They rushed along the river. They came to where Ma-ui stood, and then they saw the great, strange bird that he held. They wanted to fall upon that bird and dash it up against the sky. But the great kite was strong. The winds flung it up and flung it this way and that way. But they could not carry it off or dash it against the sky as they wanted to. Ma-ui rejoiced. How grand it was to hold a kite that the winds strove to tear away! He called out again: “O winds, O winds of Hilo, Come to the mountains, come.” Then came the west wind that had been dashing up waves in the bay of Hilo. It joined itself with the north wind and the east wind, the two winds that had been tearing and pushing at Ma-ui’s kite. Now, although the kite was made of the strongest tapa, and although it had been strengthened in every cun- ning way that Ma-ui knew, it was flung here and flung there. Ma-ui let his line out; the kite was borne up and up and above the mountains. And now he cried out to the kite that he had made: “Climb up, climb up To the highest level of the heavens, To all the sides of the heavens. Climb thou to thy ancestor, To the sacred bird in the heavens.” The three winds joined together, and now they made a fiercer attack upon Ma-ui’s kite. The winds tore and tossed it. Then the line broke in Ma-ui’s hands. The winds flung the kite across the mountains. And then, to punish it for having dared to face the heavens, they rammed it down into the volcano, and stirred up the fires against it. Then Ma-ui made for himself another kite. He flew it, and rejoiced in the flying of it, and all who saw him wondered at how high his kite went and how gracefully it bore itself in the heavens. But never again did he call upon the great winds to help him in his sport. Sometimes he would fasten his line to the black stones in the bed of the Wai-lu-ku River, and he would let the kite soar upward and range here and there. He knew by watching his soaring kite whether it would be dry and pleasant weather, and he showed his neighbors how they might know it. “Eh, neighbor,” one would say to another, “it is going to be dry weather; look how Ma-ui’s kite keeps in the sky.” They knew that they could go to the fields to work and spread out their tapa to dry, for as long as the kite soared the rain would not fall. Ma-ui learned what a strong pull the fierce winds had. He used to bring his kite with him when he went out on the ocean in his canoe. He would let it free; then, fastening his line to the canoe, he would let the wind that pulled the kite pull him along. By flying his kite he learned how to go more swiftly over the ocean in his canoe, and how to make further voyages than ever a man made before. The legend of Ma-ui continues in How Ma-Ui Fished Up the Great Island.","['mule', 'bearing', 'back', 'silver', 'latter', 'glory', 'load', 'march', 'proudly', 'forward', 'road', 'jingle', 'bell', 'twas', 'plain', 'like', 'burden', 'well', 'wild-wood', 'glena', 'band', 'robber', 'menrush', 'forth', 'upon', 'twain', 'well', 'silver', 'pleased', 'bridle', 'seizedthe', 'treasure', 'mule', 'vain', 'poor', 'mule', 'struggle', 'repelhis', 'ruthless', 'fellstabb', 'bitter', 'sigh', 'promise', 'humble', 'friend', 'danger', 'free', 'welter', 'gore', 'friend', 'fellow-mule', 'reply', 'well', 'work', 'high', 'thou', 'hadst', 'miller', 'drudge', 'thou', 'wouldst', 'thus']","['lift', 'second', 'ma-ui', 'great', 'deed', 'grow', 'mother', 'house', 'tree', 'touch', 'leaf', 'flatten', 'woman', 'burn', 'heat', 'near', 'cloud', 'close', 'much', 'dark-', 'ness', 'earth', 'something', 'ma-ui', 'make_mind', 'would', 'lift', 'somewhere', 'mark', 'tattooed', 'magic', 'mark', 'give', 'great', 'strength', 'lift', 'woman', 'drink', 'make', 'strength', 'great', 'give', 'drink', 'gourd', 'push', 'woman', 'give', 'gourd', 'drink', 'ma-ui', 'push', 'lift', 'high', 'tree', 'push', 'mountain', 'push', 'rest', 'high_mountain', 'woman', 'able', 'walk', 'earth', 'light', 'clear', 'tree', 'grow', 'high_high', 'grow', 'fruit', 'even', 'leaf', 'flatten', 'time', 'leaf', 'flatten', 'lift', 'ma-ui', 'make', 'kite', 'mother', 'large', 'strong', 'piece', 'tapa-cloth', 'ever', 'make', 'form', 'kite', 'frame', 'cross-sticks', 'wood', 'tail', 'kite', 'fifteen', 'fathom', 'long', 'line', 'olona', 'vine', 'twenty', 'time', 'forty', 'fathom', 'length', 'start', 'kite', 'rise', 'slowly', 'wind', 'barely', 'held', 'people', 'look', 'ma-ui', 'lift', 'kite', 'ma-ui', 'make', 'angry', 'heard', 'drew', 'kite', 'still', 'able', 'make', 'rise', 'incantation-', 'strong', 'wind', 'come', 'soft', 'wind', 'come', 'still', 'kite', 'would', 'rise', 'remember', 'valley', 'wai-', 'wizard', 'control', 'wind', 'mountain_valley', 'ma-ui', 'calabash', 'wizard', 'kept', 'wind', 'loose', 'direct', 'blow', 'along', 'river', 'place', 'kite', 'ma-ui', 'back', 'stood', 'foot', 'upon', 'rock', 'along_bank', 'wai-lu-ku', 'river', 'stood', 'brace', 'hold', 'kite', 'stood', 'mark', 'foot', 'call', 'wind', 'wind', 'wai-pio', 'come', 'calabash', 'calabash', 'perpetual', 'wind', 'wind', 'wind', 'hilo', 'come', 'quickly', 'come', 'power', 'call', 'ma-ui', 'give', 'across', 'mountain_valley', 'wai-pio', 'sooner', 'hear', 'wizard', 'open', 'calabash', 'wind', 'rush', 'hilo', 'dash', 'water', 'call', 'ma-ui', 'come', 'wind', 'wind', 'hilo', 'hurry', 'hurry', 'come', 'wind', 'turn', 'rush', 'along', 'river', 'come', 'ma-ui', 'stood', 'great', 'strange', 'bird', 'held', 'want', 'fall', 'upon', 'bird', 'dash', 'great', 'kite', 'strong', 'wind', 'flung', 'flung', 'could', 'carry', 'dash', 'want', 'ma-ui', 'rejoice', 'grand', 'hold', 'kite', 'wind', 'strove', 'tear', 'away', 'call', 'wind', 'wind', 'hilo', 'come', 'mountain', 'come', 'come', 'west_wind', 'dash', 'wave', 'hilo', 'join', 'north_wind', 'east_wind', 'wind', 'tear', 'push', 'ma-ui', 'kite', 'although', 'kite', 'make', 'strong', 'tapa', 'although', 'strengthen', 'every', 'cun-', 'ning', 'ma-ui', 'knew', 'flung', 'flung', 'ma-ui', 'line', 'kite', 'borne', 'mountain', 'kite', 'make', 'climb', 'climb_high', 'level', 'heaven', 'side', 'heaven', 'climb', 'thou', 'ancestor', 'sacred', 'bird', 'heaven', 'three', 'wind', 'join', 'together', 'make', 'fiercer', 'attack', 'upon', 'ma-ui', 'kite', 'wind', 'tore', 'toss', 'line', 'broke', 'ma-ui', 'hand', 'wind', 'flung', 'kite', 'across', 'mountain', 'punish', 'dare', 'face', 'heaven', 'volcano', 'stir', 'fire', 'ma-ui', 'make', 'another', 'kite', 'flew', 'rejoice', 'wonder', 'high', 'kite', 'gracefully', 'bore', 'heaven', 'never', 'call', 'upon', 'great', 'wind', 'help', 'sport', 'sometimes', 'would', 'fasten', 'line', 'black', 'stone', 'wai-lu-ku', 'river', 'would', 'kite', 'soar', 'upward', 'range', 'knew', 'watch', 'soar', 'kite', 'whether', 'would', 'pleasant', 'weather', 'show', 'neighbor', 'might', 'know', 'neighbor', 'would', 'another', 'weather', 'look', 'ma-ui', 'kite', 'keep', 'knew', 'could', 'field', 'work', 'spread', 'tapa', 'long', 'kite', 'soar', 'rain', 'would', 'fall', 'ma-ui', 'learn', 'strong', 'pull', 'fierce', 'wind', 'bring', 'kite', 'ocean', 'canoe', 'would', 'free', 'fasten', 'line', 'canoe', 'would', 'wind', 'pull', 'kite', 'pull', 'along', 'kite', 'learn', 'swiftly', 'ocean', 'canoe', 'make', 'voyage', 'ever', 'make', 'legend', 'ma-ui', 'continue', 'ma-ui', 'fish', 'great', 'island']",austronesian,sid2797
