91,irish,Monday! Tuesday!,"There once lived a lad in old Ireland named Lusmore. He had a great hump on his back, and whenever he sat down he had to rest his chin on his knee for support. But, in spite of this, he was as happy as a cricket, and used to go about the country with a sprig of Fairy-cap, or Foxglove, in his little straw hat. He went from house to house plaiting baskets out of rushes, and in that way he earned a living. And he was so merry that people always gave him a penny more than he asked.One evening, he was returning from a distant town, and as he walked slowly on account of his hump, it grew dark before he could reach home. He came to an old mound by the side of the road, and, being tired, sat down on it to rest.He had not been sitting there long when he heard strains of music, and many little voices singing sweetly. He laid his ear to the mound, and perceived that the music and singing came from inside it. And he could hear the words that the little voices were chanting over and over again:—“Monday! Tuesday!Monday! Tuesday!Monday! Tuesday!”It was all so very sweet, that Lusmore listened with delight; but by and by he grew tired of hearing the same words sung over and over. He waited politely until the voices had finished their song, then he called:—“And Wednesday!”The Fairies—for it was the singing of Fairies that he heard—were so pleased with Lusmore’s addition to their words, that they pulled him right down through the top of the mound with the speed of a whirlwind. And he went falling and twirling round and round as light as a feather.He found himself in a palace so bright that it dazzled his eyes. Then all the Fairies stopped capering and dancing, and came crowding around him. And one, wearing a crown, stepped forward and said:—“Lusmore! Lusmore!The hump that you wore,On your back is no more.Look down on the floor,And see it, Lusmore!”And as these words were being said, Lusmore felt himself grow so light and happy, that he could have bounded up to the moon. And he saw his hump tumble off his back and roll on the floor. Then the Fairies took hands, and danced around him, and as they did so he became dizzy and fell asleep.When he opened his eyes it was broad daylight, and the sun was shining, and the birds were singing, and cows and sheep were grazing peacefully around him. He put his hand to his hump. It was gone! And there he was, as tall, straight, and handsome as any other lad in Ireland. And, besides all that, he was dressed in a full suit of beautiful clothes.He went toward his home stepping out lightly, and jumping high at every step, so full of joy was he. And as he passed his neighbours, they hardly knew him without his hump, and because he was so straight and handsome, and was dressed so finely.Now, in another village, not far away, lived a lad named Jack Madden. He also had a great hump on his back. He was a peevish, cunning creature, and liked to scratch and pinch all who came near him.When he heard how the Fairies had taken away Lusmore’s hump, he decided that he, too, would visit them. So one night after darkness had fallen, he sat down on the mound all alone, and waited. He had not been there long before he heard the music, and the sweet voices singing:—“Monday! Tuesday!Monday! Tuesday!Monday! Tuesday!And Wednesday!”And as he was in a very great hurry to get rid of his hump, he did not wait for the Fairies to finish their song, but yelled out, thinking that two days were better than one:—“And Thursday and Friday!”No sooner had the words left his lips, than he was taken up quickly, and whisked through the mound with terrific force. And the Fairies came crowding around him, screeching and buzzing with anger, and crying out:—“Our song you have spoiled!Our song you have spoiled!Our song you have spoiled!”Then the one wearing the crown stepped forward, and said:—“Jack Madden! Jack Madden!Your words came so bad in,That your life we will sadden!Here’s two humps for Jack Madden!”And quick as a wink, twenty Fairies brought Lusmore’s hump and clapped it down on Jack Madden’s back, and there it was fixed as firmly as if nailed on with tenpenny nails.Then out of the mound they kicked him. And when morning was come, he crept home with the two humps on his back—and he is wearing them still.","['live', 'ireland', 'name', 'lusmore', 'great', 'hump', 'back', 'whenever', 'rest', 'chin',

111,irish,Nightingale and the Rose,"“She said that she would dance with me if I brought her red roses,” cried the young Student; “but in all my garden there is no red rose.”From her nest in the holm-oak tree the Nightingale heard him, and she looked out through the leaves, and wondered.“No red rose in all my garden!” he cried, and his beautiful eyes filled with tears.  “Ah, on what little things does happiness depend!  I have read all that the wise men have written, and all the secrets of philosophy are mine, yet for want of a red rose is my life made wretched.”“Here at last is a true lover,” said the Nightingale.  “Night after night have I sung of him, though I knew him not: night after night have I told his story to the stars, and now I see him.  His hair is dark as the hyacinth-blossom, and his lips are red as the rose of his desire; but passion has made his face like pale ivory, and sorrow has set her seal upon his brow.”“The Prince gives a ball to-morrow night,” murmured the young Student, “and my love will be of the company.  If I bring her a red rose she will dance with me till dawn.  If I bring her a red rose, I shall hold her in my arms, and she will lean her head upon my shoulder, and her hand will be clasped in mine.  But there is no red rose in my garden, so I shall sit lonely, and she will pass me by.  She will have no heed of me, and my heart will break.”“Here indeed is the true lover,” said the Nightingale.  “What I sing of, he suffers—what is joy to me, to him is pain.  Surely Love is a wonderful thing.  It is more precious than emeralds, and dearer than fine opals.  Pearls and pomegranates cannot buy it, nor is it set forth in the marketplace.  It may not be purchased of the merchants, nor can it be weighed out in the balance for gold.”“The musicians will sit in their gallery,” said the young Student, “and play upon their stringed instruments, and my love will dance to the sound of the harp and the violin.  She will dance so lightly that her feet will not touch the floor, and the courtiers in their gay dresses will throng round her.  But with me she will not dance, for I have no red rose to give her”; and he flung himself down on the grass, and buried his face in his hands, and wept.“Why is he weeping?” asked a little Green Lizard, as he ran past him with his tail in the air.“Why, indeed?” said a Butterfly, who was fluttering about after a sunbeam.“Why, indeed?” whispered a Daisy to his neighbour, in a soft, low voice.“He is weeping for a red rose,” said the Nightingale.“For a red rose?” they cried; “how very ridiculous!” and the little Lizard, who was something of a cynic, laughed outright.But the Nightingale understood the secret of the Student’s sorrow, and she sat silent in the oak-tree, and thought about the mystery of Love.Suddenly she spread her brown wings for flight, and soared into the air.  She passed through the grove like a shadow, and like a shadow she sailed across the garden.In the centre of the grass-plot was standing a beautiful Rose-tree, and when she saw it she flew over to it, and lit upon a spray.“Give me a red rose,” she cried, “and I will sing you my sweetest song.”But the Tree shook its head.“My roses are white,” it answered; “as white as the foam of the sea, and whiter than the snow upon the mountain.  But go to my brother who grows round the old sun-dial, and perhaps he will give you what you want.”So the Nightingale flew over to the Rose-tree that was growing round the old sun-dial.“Give me a red rose,” she cried, “and I will sing you my sweetest song.”But the Tree shook its head.“My roses are yellow,” it answered; “as yellow as the hair of the mermaiden who sits upon an amber throne, and yellower than the daffodil that blooms in the meadow before the mower comes with his scythe.  But go to my brother who grows beneath the Student’s window, and perhaps he will give you what you want.”So the Nightingale flew over to the Rose-tree that was growing beneath the Student’s window.“Give me a red rose,” she cried, “and I will sing you my sweetest song.”But the Tree shook its head.“My roses are red,” it answered, “as red as the feet of the dove, and redder than the great fans of coral that wave and wave in the ocean-cavern.  But the winter has chilled my veins, and the frost has nipped my buds, and the storm has broken my branches, and I shall have no roses at all this year.”“One red rose is all I want,” cried the Nightingale, “only one red rose!  Is there no way by which I can get it?”“There is a way,” answered the Tree; “but it is so terrible that I dare not tell it to you.”“Tell it to me,” said the Nightingale, “I am not afraid.”“If you want a red rose,” said the Tree, “you must build it out of music by moonlight, and stain it with your own heart’s-blood.  You must sing to me with your breast against a thorn.  All night long you must sing to me, and the thorn must pierce your heart, and your life-blood must flow into my veins, and become mine.”“Death is a great price to pay for a red rose,” cried the Nightingale, “and Life is very dear to all.  It is pleasant to sit in the green wood, and to watch the Sun in his chariot of gold, and the Moon in her chariot of pearl.  Sweet is the scent of the hawthorn, and sweet are the bluebells that hide in the valley, and the heather that blows on the hill.  Yet Love is better than Life, and what is the heart of a bird compared to the heart of a man?”So she spread her brown wings for flight, and soared into the air.  She swept over the garden like a shadow, and like a shadow she sailed through the grove.The young Student was still lying on the grass, where she had left him, and the tears were not yet dry in his beautiful eyes.“His lips are sweet as honey.” Illustration by Charles Robinson, published in The Happy Prince and Other Tales by Oscar Wilde (1888), David Nutt.“Be happy,” cried the Nightingale, “be happy; you shall have your red rose.  I will build it out of music by moonlight, and stain it with my own heart’s-blood.  All that I ask of you in return is that you will be a true lover, for Love is wiser than Philosophy, though she is wise, and mightier than Power, though he is mighty.  Flame-coloured are his wings, and coloured like flame is his body.  His lips are sweet as honey, and his breath is like frankincense.”The Student looked up from the grass, and listened, but he could not understand what the Nightingale was saying to him, for he only knew the things that are written down in books.But the Oak-tree understood, and felt sad, for he was very fond of the little Nightingale who had built her nest in his branches.“Sing me one last song,” he whispered; “I shall feel very lonely when you are gone.”So the Nightingale sang to the Oak-tree, and her voice was like water bubbling from a silver jar.When she had finished her song the Student got up, and pulled a note-book and a lead-pencil out of his pocket.“She has form,” he said to himself, as he walked away through the grove—“that cannot be denied to her; but has she got feeling?  I am afraid not.  In fact, she is like most artists; she is all style, without any sincerity.  She would not sacrifice herself for others.  She thinks merely of music, and everybody knows that the arts are selfish.  Still, it must be admitted that she has some beautiful notes in her voice.  What a pity it is that they do not mean anything, or do any practical good.”  And he went into his room, and lay down on his little pallet-bed, and began to think of his love; and, after a time, he fell asleep.And when the Moon shone in the heavens the Nightingale flew to the Rose-tree, and set her breast against the thorn.  All night long she sang with her breast against the thorn, and the cold crystal Moon leaned down and listened.  All night long she sang, and the thorn went deeper and deeper into her breast, and her life-blood ebbed away from her.She sang first of the birth of love in the heart of a boy and a girl.  And on the top-most spray of the Rose-tree there blossomed a marvellous rose, petal following petal, as song followed song.  Pale was it, at first, as the mist that hangs over the river—pale as the feet of the morning, and silver as the wings of the dawn.  As the shadow of a rose in a mirror of silver, as the shadow of a rose in a water-pool, so was the rose that blossomed on the topmost spray of the Tree.But the Tree cried to the Nightingale to press closer against the thorn.  “Press closer, little Nightingale,” cried the Tree, “or the Day will come before the rose is finished.”So the Nightingale pressed closer against the thorn, and louder and louder grew her song, for she sang of the birth of passion in the soul of a man and a maid.And a delicate flush of pink came into the leaves of the rose, like the flush in the face of the bridegroom when he kisses the lips of the bride.  But the thorn had not yet reached her heart, so the rose’s heart remained white, for only a Nightingale’s heart’s-blood can crimson the heart of a rose.And the Tree cried to the Nightingale to press closer against the thorn.  “Press closer, little Nightingale,” cried the Tree, “or the Day will come before the rose is finished.”So the Nightingale pressed closer against the thorn, and the thorn touched her heart, and a fierce pang of pain shot through her.  Bitter, bitter was the pain, and wilder and wilder grew her song, for she sang of the Love that is perfected by Death, of the Love that dies not in the tomb.And the marvellous rose became crimson, like the rose of the eastern sky.  Crimson was the girdle of petals, and crimson as a ruby was the heart.But the Nightingale’s voice grew fainter, and her little wings began to beat, and a film came over her eyes.  Fainter and fainter grew her song, and she felt something choking her in her throat.Then she gave one last burst of music.  The white Moon heard it, and she forgot the dawn, and lingered on in the sky.  The red rose heard it, and it trembled all over with ecstasy, and opened its petals to the cold morning air.  Echo bore it to her purple cavern in the hills, and woke the sleeping shepherds from their dreams.  It floated through the reeds of the river, and they carried its message to the sea.“Look, look!” cried the Tree, “the rose is finished now”; but the Nightingale made no answer, for she was lying dead in the long grass, with the thorn in her heart.And at noon the Student opened his window and looked out.“Why, what a wonderful piece of luck!” he cried; “here is a red rose!  I have never seen any rose like it in all my life.  It is so beautiful that I am sure it has a long Latin name”; and he leaned down and plucked it.Then he put on his hat, and ran up to the Professor’s house with the rose in his hand.The daughter of the Professor was sitting in the doorway winding blue silk on a reel, and her little dog was lying at her feet.“You said that you would dance with me if I brought you a red rose,” cried the Student.  “Here is the reddest rose in all the world.  You will wear it to-night next your heart, and as we dance together it will tell you how I love you.”But the girl frowned.“I am afraid it will not go with my dress,” she answered; “and, besides, the Chamberlain’s nephew has sent me some real jewels, and everybody knows that jewels cost far more than flowers.”“Well, upon my word, you are very ungrateful,” said the Student angrily; and he threw the rose into the street, where it fell into the gutter, and a cart-wheel went over it.“Ungrateful!” said the girl.  “I tell you what, you are very rude; and, after all, who are you?  Only a Student.  Why, I don’t believe you have even got silver buckles to your shoes as the Chamberlain’s nephew has”; and she got up from her chair and went into the house.“What a silly thing Love is,” said the Student as he walked away.  “It is not half as useful as Logic, for it does not prove anything, and it is always telling one of things that are not going to happen, and making one believe things that are not true.  In fact, it is quite unpractical, and, as in this age to be practical is everything, I shall go back to Philosophy and study Metaphysics.”So he returned to his room and pulled out a great dusty book, and began to read.","['would', 'dance', 'brought', 'rose',

538,irish,The Happy Prince,"High above the city, on a tall column, stood the statue of the Happy Prince. He was gilded all over with thin leaves of fine gold, for eyes he had two bright sapphires, and a large red ruby glowed on his sword-hilt.He was very much admired indeed. “He is as beautiful as a weathercock,” remarked one of the Town Councillors who wished to gain a reputation for having artistic tastes; “only not quite so useful,” he added, fearing lest people should think him unpractical, which he really was not.“Why can’t you be like the Happy Prince?” asked a sensible mother of her little boy who was crying for the moon. “The Happy Prince never dreams of crying for anything.”“I am glad there is some one in the world who is quite happy,” muttered a disappointed man as he gazed at the wonderful statue.“He looks just like an angel,” said the Charity Children as they came out of the cathedral in their bright scarlet cloaks and their clean white pinafores.“How do you know?” said the Mathematical Master, “you have never seen one.”“Ah! but we have, in our dreams,” answered the children; and the Mathematical Master frowned and looked very severe, for he did not approve of children dreaming.One night there flew over the city a little Swallow. His friends had gone away to Egypt six weeks before, but he had stayed behind, for he was in love with the most beautiful Reed. He had met her early in the spring as he was flying down the river after a big yellow moth, and had been so attracted by her slender waist that he had stopped to talk to her.“Shall I love you?” said the Swallow, who liked to come to the point at once, and the Reed made him a low bow. So he flew round and round her, touching the water with his wings, and making silver ripples. This was his courtship, and it lasted all through the summer.“It is a ridiculous attachment,” twittered the other Swallows; “she has no money, and far too many relations”; and indeed the river was quite full of Reeds. Then, when the autumn came they all flew away.After they had gone he felt lonely, and began to tire of his lady-love. “She has no conversation,” he said, “and I am afraid that she is a coquette, for she is always flirting with the wind.” And certainly, whenever the wind blew, the Reed made the most graceful curtseys. “I admit that she is domestic,” he continued, “but I love travelling, and my wife, consequently, should love travelling also.”“Will you come away with me?” he said finally to her; but the Reed shook her head, she was so attached to her home.“You have been trifling with me,” he cried. “I am off to the Pyramids. Good-bye!” and he flew away.All day long he flew, and at night-time he arrived at the city. “Where shall I put up?” he said; “I hope the town has made preparations.”Then he saw the statue on the tall column.“I will put up there,” he cried; “it is a fine position, with plenty of fresh air.” So he alighted just between the feet of the Happy Prince.“I have a golden bedroom,” he said softly to himself as he looked round, and he prepared to go to sleep; but just as he was putting his head under his wing a large drop of water fell on him. “What a curious thing!” he cried; “there is not a single cloud in the sky, the stars are quite clear and bright, and yet it is raining. The climate in the north of Europe is really dreadful. The Reed used to like the rain, but that was merely her selfishness.”Then another drop fell.“What is the use of a statue if it cannot keep the rain off?” he said; “I must look for a good chimney-pot,” and he determined to fly away.But before he had opened his wings, a third drop fell, and he looked up, and saw—Ah! what did he see?The eyes of the Happy Prince were filled with tears, and tears were running down his golden cheeks. His face was so beautiful in the moonlight that the little Swallow was filled with pity.“Who are you?” he said.“I am the Happy Prince.”“Why are you weeping then?” asked the Swallow; “you have quite drenched me.”“When I was alive and had a human heart,” answered the statue, “I did not know what tears were, for I lived in the Palace of Sans-Souci, where sorrow is not allowed to enter. In the daytime I played with my companions in the garden, and in the evening I led the dance in the Great Hall. Round the garden ran a very lofty wall, but I never cared to ask what lay beyond it, everything about me was so beautiful. My courtiers called me the Happy Prince, and happy indeed I was, if pleasure be happiness. So I lived, and so I died. And now that I am dead they have set me up here so high that I can see all the ugliness and all the misery of my city, and though my heart is made of lead yet I cannot chose but weep.”“What! is he not solid gold?” said the Swallow to himself. He was too polite to make any personal remarks out loud.“Far away,” continued the statue in a low musical voice, “far away in a little street there is a poor house. One of the windows is open, and through it I can see a woman seated at a table. Her face is thin and worn, and she has coarse, red hands, all pricked by the needle, for she is a seamstress. She is embroidering passion-flowers on a satin gown for the loveliest of the Queen’s maids-of-honour to wear at the next Court-ball. In a bed in the corner of the room her little boy is lying ill. He has a fever, and is asking for oranges. His mother has nothing to give him but river water, so he is crying. Swallow, Swallow, little Swallow, will you not bring her the ruby out of my sword-hilt? My feet are fastened to this pedestal and I cannot move.”“I am waited for in Egypt,” said the Swallow. “My friends are flying up and down the Nile, and talking to the large lotus-flowers. Soon they will go to sleep in the tomb of the great King. The King is there himself in his painted coffin. He is wrapped in yellow linen, and embalmed with spices. Round his neck is a chain of pale green jade, and his hands are like withered leaves.”“Swallow, Swallow, little Swallow,” said the Prince, “will you not stay with me for one night, and be my messenger? The boy is so thirsty, and the mother so sad.”“I don’t think I like boys,” answered the Swallow. “Last summer, when I was staying on the river, there were two rude boys, the miller’s sons, who were always throwing stones at me. They never hit me, of course; we swallows fly far too well for that, and besides, I come of a family famous for its agility; but still, it was a mark of disrespect.”But the Happy Prince looked so sad that the little Swallow was sorry. “It is very cold here,” he said; “but I will stay with you for one night, and be your messenger.”“Thank you, little Swallow,” said the Prince.So the Swallow picked out the great ruby from the Prince’s sword, and flew away with it in his beak over the roofs of the town.He passed by the cathedral tower, where the white marble angels were sculptured. He passed by the palace and heard the sound of dancing. A beautiful girl came out on the balcony with her lover. “How wonderful the stars are,” he said to her, “and how wonderful is the power of love!”“I hope my dress will be ready in time for the State-ball,” she answered; “I have ordered passion-flowers to be embroidered on it; but the seamstresses are so lazy.”He passed over the river, and saw the lanterns hanging to the masts of the ships. He passed over the Ghetto, and saw the old Jews bargaining with each other, and weighing out money in copper scales. At last he came to the poor house and looked in. The boy was tossing feverishly on his bed, and the mother had fallen asleep, she was so tired. In he hopped, and laid the great ruby on the table beside the woman’s thimble. Then he flew gently round the bed, fanning the boy’s forehead with his wings. “How cool I feel,” said the boy, “I must be getting better”; and he sank into a delicious slumber.Then the Swallow flew back to the Happy Prince, and told him what he had done. “It is curious,” he remarked, “but I feel quite warm now, although it is so cold.”“That is because you have done a good action,” said the Prince. And the little Swallow began to think, and then he fell asleep. Thinking always made him sleepy.When day broke he flew down to the river and had a bath. “What a remarkable phenomenon,” said the Professor of Ornithology as he was passing over the bridge. “A swallow in winter!” And he wrote a long letter about it to the local newspaper. Every one quoted it, it was full of so many words that they could not understand.“To-night I go to Egypt,” said the Swallow, and he was in high spirits at the prospect. He visited all the public monuments, and sat a long time on top of the church steeple. Wherever he went the Sparrows chirruped, and said to each other, “What a distinguished stranger!” so he enjoyed himself very much.When the moon rose he flew back to the Happy Prince. “Have you any commissions for Egypt?” he cried; “I am just starting.”“Swallow, Swallow, little Swallow,” said the Prince, “will you not stay with me one night longer?”“I am waited for in Egypt,” answered the Swallow. “To-morrow my friends will fly up to the Second Cataract. The river-horse couches there among the bulrushes, and on a great granite throne sits the God Memnon. All night long he watches the stars, and when the morning star shines he utters one cry of joy, and then he is silent. At noon the yellow lions come down to the water’s edge to drink. They have eyes like green beryls, and their roar is louder than the roar of the cataract.”“Swallow, Swallow, little Swallow,” said the Prince, “far away across the city I see a young man in a garret. He is leaning over a desk covered with papers, and in a tumbler by his side there is a bunch of withered violets. His hair is brown and crisp, and his lips are red as a pomegranate, and he has large and dreamy eyes. He is trying to finish a play for the Director of the Theatre, but he is too cold to write any more. There is no fire in the grate, and hunger has made him faint.”“I will wait with you one night longer,” said the Swallow, who really had a good heart. “Shall I take him another ruby?”“Alas! I have no ruby now,” said the Prince; “my eyes are all that I have left. They are made of rare sapphires, which were brought out of India a thousand years ago. Pluck out one of them and take it to him. He will sell it to the jeweller, and buy food and firewood, and finish his play.”“Dear Prince,” said the Swallow, “I cannot do that”; and he began to weep.“Swallow, Swallow, little Swallow,” said the Prince, “do as I command you.”So the Swallow plucked out the Prince’s eye, and flew away to the student’s garret. It was easy enough to get in, as there was a hole in the roof. Through this he darted, and came into the room. The young man had his head buried in his hands, so he did not hear the flutter of the bird’s wings, and when he looked up he found the beautiful sapphire lying on the withered violets.“I am beginning to be appreciated,” he cried; “this is from some great admirer. Now I can finish my play,” and he looked quite happy.The next day the Swallow flew down to the harbour. He sat on the mast of a large vessel and watched the sailors hauling big chests out of the hold with ropes. “Heave a-hoy!” they shouted as each chest came up. “I am going to Egypt”! cried the Swallow, but nobody minded, and when the moon rose he flew back to the Happy Prince.“I am come to bid you good-bye,” he cried.“Swallow, Swallow, little Swallow,” said the Prince, “will you not stay with me one night longer?”“It is winter,” answered the Swallow, “and the chill snow will soon be here. In Egypt the sun is warm on the green palm-trees, and the crocodiles lie in the mud and look lazily about them. My companions are building a nest in the Temple of Baalbec, and the pink and white doves are watching them, and cooing to each other. Dear Prince, I must leave you, but I will never forget you, and next spring I will bring you back two beautiful jewels in place of those you have given away. The ruby shall be redder than a red rose, and the sapphire shall be as blue as the great sea.”“In the square below,” said the Happy Prince, “there stands a little match-girl. She has let her matches fall in the gutter, and they are all spoiled. Her father will beat her if she does not bring home some money, and she is crying. She has no shoes or stockings, and her little head is bare. Pluck out my other eye, and give it to her, and her father will not beat her.”“I will stay with you one night longer,” said the Swallow, “but I cannot pluck out your eye. You would be quite blind then.”“Swallow, Swallow, little Swallow,” said the Prince, “do as I command you.”So he plucked out the Prince’s other eye, and darted down with it. He swooped past the match-girl, and slipped the jewel into the palm of her hand. “What a lovely bit of glass,” cried the little girl; and she ran home, laughing.Then the Swallow came back to the Prince. “You are blind now,” he said, “so I will stay with you always.”“No, little Swallow,” said the poor Prince, “you must go away to Egypt.”“I will stay with you always,” said the Swallow, and he slept at the Prince’s feet.All the next day he sat on the Prince’s shoulder, and told him stories of what he had seen in strange lands. He told him of the red ibises, who stand in long rows on the banks of the Nile, and catch gold-fish in their beaks; of the Sphinx, who is as old as the world itself, and lives in the desert, and knows everything; of the merchants, who walk slowly by the side of their camels, and carry amber beads in their hands; of the King of the Mountains of the Moon, who is as black as ebony, and worships a large crystal; of the great green snake that sleeps in a palm-tree, and has twenty priests to feed it with honey-cakes; and of the pygmies who sail over a big lake on large flat leaves, and are always at war with the butterflies.“Dear little Swallow,” said the Prince, “you tell me of marvellous things, but more marvellous than anything is the suffering of men and of women. There is no Mystery so great as Misery. Fly over my city, little Swallow, and tell me what you see there.”So the Swallow flew over the great city, and saw the rich making merry in their beautiful houses, while the beggars were sitting at the gates. He flew into dark lanes, and saw the white faces of starving children looking out listlessly at the black streets. Under the archway of a bridge two little boys were lying in one another’s arms to try and keep themselves warm. “How hungry we are!” they said. “You must not lie here,” shouted the Watchman, and they wandered out into the rain.Then he flew back and told the Prince what he had seen.“I am covered with fine gold,” said the Prince, “you must take it off, leaf by leaf, and give it to my poor; the living always think that gold can make them happy.”Leaf after leaf of the fine gold the Swallow picked off, till the Happy Prince looked quite dull and grey. Leaf after leaf of the fine gold he brought to the poor, and the children’s faces grew rosier, and they laughed and played games in the street. “We have bread now!” they cried.Then the snow came, and after the snow came the frost. The streets looked as if they were made of silver, they were so bright and glistening; long icicles like crystal daggers hung down from the eaves of the houses, everybody went about in furs, and the little boys wore scarlet caps and skated on the ice.The poor little Swallow grew colder and colder, but he would not leave the Prince, he loved him too well. He picked up crumbs outside the baker’s door when the baker was not looking and tried to keep himself warm by flapping his wings.But at last he knew that he was going to die. He had just strength to fly up to the Prince’s shoulder once more. “Good-bye, dear Prince!” he murmured, “will you let me kiss your hand?”“I am glad that you are going to Egypt at last, little Swallow,” said the Prince, “you have stayed too long here; but you must kiss me on the lips, for I love you.”“It is not to Egypt that I am going,” said the Swallow. “I am going to the House of Death. Death is the brother of Sleep, is he not?”And he kissed the Happy Prince on the lips, and fell down dead at his feet.At that moment a curious crack sounded inside the statue, as if something had broken. The fact is that the leaden heart had snapped right in two. It certainly was a dreadfully hard frost.Early the next morning the Mayor was walking in the square below in company with the Town Councillors. As they passed the column he looked up at the statue: “Dear me! how shabby the Happy Prince looks!” he said.“How shabby indeed!” cried the Town Councillors, who always agreed with the Mayor; and they went up to look at it.“The ruby has fallen out of his sword, his eyes are gone, and he is golden no longer,” said the Mayor in fact, “he is litttle better than a beggar!”“Little better than a beggar,” said the Town Councillors.“And here is actually a dead bird at his feet!” continued the Mayor. “We must really issue a proclamation that birds are not to be allowed to die here.” And the Town Clerk made a note of the suggestion.So they pulled down the statue of the Happy Prince. “As he is no longer beautiful he is no longer useful,” said the Art Professor at the University.Then they melted the statue in a furnace, and the Mayor held a meeting of the Corporation to decide what was to be done with the metal. “We must have another statue, of course,” he said, “and it shall be a statue of myself.”“Of myself,” said each of the Town Councillors, and they quarrelled. When I last heard of them they were quarrelling still.“What a strange thing!” said the overseer of the workmen at the foundry. “This broken lead heart will not melt in the furnace. We must throw it away.” So they threw it on a dust-heap where the dead Swallow was also lying.“Bring me the two most precious things in the city,” said God to one of His Angels; and the Angel brought Him the leaden heart and the dead bird.“You have rightly chosen,” said God, “for in my garden of Paradise this little bird shall sing for evermore, and in my city of gold the Happy Prince shall praise me.”","['high', 'city', 'tall', 'column', 'stood', 'statue', 'happy', 'prince', 'gild', 'thin', 'leaf', 'fine', 'gold', 'bright', 'sapphire', 'large', 'ruby', 'glowed', 'sword-hilt', 'much', 'admire',

599,irish,Yellow Lily,"Once upon a time, when fairies were as plentiful as dandelions in the meadow, there dwelt in Ireland a mighty king and his good queen. The names of these great rulers have long since been forgotten by writers of history, for they lived hundreds and hundreds of years ago.They ruled over Erin, and lived in a great stone castle built high upon a cliff overlooking the sea. Erin was the most beautiful part of Ireland, for its forests and great stretches of land were as green as the emerald, and its skies and waters were as blue as the turquoise.This king and queen had but one child, who was known as the Prince of Erin. He was a bright, handsome boy, but he cared only to have a good time. His father had often told him how wrong it was for him to make bets, but the lad gave no heed to his advice.One day the prince went out in the wood to hunt for deer. He tramped about all day long, carrying his bow and arrows, but no deer could he find. At last he sat down to rest.He was almost asleep when he heard a shrill whistle behind him and the tramping of heavy feet upon the fallen timbers.“Who are you?” cried a loud, gruff voice.The prince turned quickly and saw a giant striding towards him down the hill. He was almost as tall as the tallest tree, and his face was frightful to see. His eyes were like balls of fire and his nostrils belched forth black smoke.“Woe is me; it is the Giant of Loch Lein!” cried the prince. He wanted to run away as fast as he could, but his feet would not move. He stood trembling in every limb, for he knew that the Giant of Loch Lein hunted in the wood for boys just as the boys hunted for game. Many a lad had been seized by the terrible creature, taken to his castle in the heart of the forest, and had never returned to his parents.“Who are you?” again roared the giant.“I am the son of the King of Erin,” replied the boy, trying to be brave.“I have been waiting for you a long time,” said the giant with a laugh that sounded like a thunder clap. “I have never eaten a real prince, although I have heard that their meat is very tender.”The prince turned away, weak with fright; but the giant seized him and said:“Do not be frightened. As you are a son of the Ruler of Erin, I will give you a chance to escape. I understand that you can play fine games, and that you are fond of betting. Let us play a game on this hillside. If I win, I will take you to my castle, never to return to your home again.”The prince was so fond of playing games that, even in his fright, he agreed to do as the giant wished.“I have two fine estates, each containing a castle,” said the giant. “They are yours if you beat me at the game.”“And I also have two estates which shall be yours, if you beat me,” replied the prince. “No man in Erin has ever beaten me at any game.”So they played until dusk, the prince quite forgetting his fear of the giant. Although the Giant of Loch Lein was a skillful player, the Prince of Erin beat him badly.“You may go,” grumbled the giant when the game was at an end. “You are surely a wonderful player—the best in all the land.”Most of the old historians agree that the Prince of Erin did not tell his parents anything about his narrow escape from the giant. As soon as he reached home, he climbed to the top of the tallest tower where he could gaze at the forest in the distance, in which stood the castle of the giant.“I will go again tomorrow and beat the giant, for it will be huge sport,” he said to himself. “Even if I be beaten, the giant dare not destroy the son of the King of Erin, for my father’s army will search for me and tear down the castle of the giant when I am found. Besides, I understand that he has three beautiful daughters, the fairest girls in all the land. I should like to see them.”On the next morning, while the prince was preparing to go hunting, the wisest old man in the court, whose name was Glic, went to the king and said:“The prince is about to go hunting. I beg you not to let him go, for I fear that some great danger will befall him.”The king commanded his son to stay inside the palace all day; but when no one was looking, the prince stole away to the hillside near the forest. Again he heard a shrill whistle that shook the boughs of the trees like a gale, and in a few moments he saw the giant striding towards him.“Ho, ho, my young prince!” cried the giant. “I knew that you would come back today. Let us have another game. What will you wager that you can beat me playing?”“I will wager my herd of cattle,” said the prince, not so much frightened as before.“And I will wager five hundred bullocks with gold horns and silver hoofs,” said the giant. “I am quite sure you cannot beat me again.”“Agreed,” said the prince, and at once they began to play.In a short time the prince won the game, and the giant set up a howl of rage. Turning towards the forest he whistled loudly three times, and five hundred bullocks with gold horns and silver hoofs came forth.“They are yours,” said the giant. “Follow them to your palace gate and come again tomorrow.”The prince, filled with the delight of triumph, followed the cattle to the palace gate where the king’s herder took charge of them. Then he hastened to his father and mother and bade them go to see the costly wager he had won from the Giant of Loch Lein.The king and queen and all the court were delighted with the cattle, whose gold horns and silver hoofs shone in the sunlight.On the third morning the Prince of Erin again put on his hunting clothes and started to the forest; but Glic, the fortune teller, again stopped him.“No good can come from this gaming, for the giant will beat you at last, and you will never return to us again,” said Glic.“I am not afraid,” laughed the prince, “for if he take me prisoner, I will have his head.”So he set forth again, singing a merry tune. Hardly had he seated himself upon the hillside when he heard the giant’s whistle. The prince was not at all frightened, although the giant scowled with anger because he had been obliged to give up his herd of cattle.“What will you wager today?” roared the giant.“I will wager my head against yours,” said the prince boldly.“Ha, ha! you have grown quite brave,” laughed the giant mockingly. “I will wager my head that I can beat you today. If you lose the game, I will have your head before the sun rises to-morrow.”They played on the hillside till dusk. The game was a close one, full of breathless interest and excitement; but the prince was beaten. With a shout of triumph the giant danced about, trampling down small trees and bushes.The prince was indeed sorry that he had wagered such a useful piece of property as his head, but he did not complain.“You are an honest lad, even though you are rash,” he said presently. “I will let you live one year and one day longer. Go home to the palace, but do not tell anyone that I am to have your head. When the time has passed by, come back again to the hillside to pay your wager.”Then the giant vanished, leaving the poor prince alone, very sick at heart. He did not go home but wandered about, not caring whither he went.Finally he found that he was in a strange land far beyond the border line of Erin. On each side were green pasture lands, and in the distance were high green hills; but not a house could be seen.He wandered on and on, weak from hunger till he came to an old hut that stood at the foot of a hill. It was lighted by a candle. He entered and came face to face with an old woman who had been bending over a fire. Her teeth were as long as the staff he carried and her scant hair hung loosely about her face.Before the prince could speak, the old woman said:“You are welcome in my house, son of the King of Erin.”Then she took him by the hand, led him into a corner of the room, and told him to wash his face and hands. In the meantime she made him some hot porridge and bade him eat a hearty meal.The prince was much surprised because she knew his name, and he wondered why she remained so quiet. He thought she must be a witch; but hungry boys, no matter how high their station, are apt to forget danger when a good supper is set before them. After he had eaten and drunk all he wanted, he sat by the fire until she took him to a bedroom and told him to go to bed.On the next morning he was awakened by the witch, who bade him rise and eat his breakfast of bread and milk.He did as he was told, without so much as bidding her good morning.“I know what is bothering you, son of the King of Erin,” she said. “If you do as I bid you, you will have no cause for regret. Here is a ball of thread. Hold to one end of the thread and throw the ball before you. When you start on your journey the ball will roll; but you must keep following it and winding the thread all the time or you will be lost again. You were with me last night; you will be with my sister tonight.”The prince took the ball of thread; threw it before him, and began walking slowly and winding the thread into another ball. With each step that he took, the ball moved further and further away from him. All day long he trudged up hill and down dell, faster and faster, until his feet and hands were so tired he could scarcely move them. At last the ball of thread stopped at the door of a hut that stood at the foot of a high hill. A candle flickered in the window. He picked up the ball and ran to the door where he met another old witch whose teeth were as long as crutches.“Welcome, son of the King of Erin!” she cried. “You were with my youngest sister last night; you will be with me tonight; and tomorrow you will be with my eldest sister.”She took him into the hut, bade him wash his hands and face, gave him a hearty supper of porridge and cakes, and sent him to bed.The next morning she called him to breakfast. When he had finished eating, she gave him a ball of thread and told him to follow it as before.The prince followed it through field and over common, hurrying faster and faster every minute, until late on the following evening, when it stopped at the door of a hut that stood at the foot of a hill. A candle sputtered in the window as if to welcome him. A witch, more homely than the others, stood by the fire making porridge.She greeted the prince as her sisters had done, bade him wash his face and hands, gave him his supper, and sent him to bed. On the following morning after breakfast she gave him a ball of thread and said:“Son of the Prince of Erin, you have lost your head to the Giant of Loch Lein, who lives near by in a great castle surrounded by spikes. Some day you will lose your head to his daughter. Follow this ball of thread to the lake behind the castle. When you reach the lake at midday, the ball will be unwound. In a few minutes more the daughters of the cruel Giant of Loch Lein will come to the lake to bathe. Their names are Blue Lily, White Lily, and Yellow Lily. The latter is the wisest and most beautiful of the three. Steal her clothing and do not give it up until she promises to help you, for she is the only person in the world that can outwit the Giant of Loch Lein.”The prince thanked the witch for her advice, and followed the ball of thread to the Castle of Spikes, which was a dark, gloomy building hidden from view by great trees. When he reached the lake behind the castle, the ball of thread vanished.He stood for a time looking at the lake, which looked like a brilliant turquoise in the sunshine. Presently he heard girlish shouts of laughter. He concealed himself behind a clump of bushes where he could see without being seen. Three beautiful girls came tripping down to the edge of the water, where they stopped to look all about them.It was very easy for the prince to make out their names. The tallest one, who wore a gown of pale blue, had eyes as blue as the skies above; he knew that she must be Blue Lily.One of them was so fair that she looked as though she were carved from marble; he was sure that she was White Lily. But Yellow Lily was small and slender, with hair that shone like gold in the sunlight. She was wonderfully graceful and beautiful.Yellow Lily threw off her robe of spun gold and stood dressed in a bathing suit of the same material. With a joyous shout she leapt into the water, followed by her sisters.The Prince of Erin darted forth from his hiding-place, and seized the robe of spun gold. Yellow Lily saw him and cried at the top of her voice:“Give me back my golden robe. My father will kill me if I lose it. Please do not run away.”“What will you give me for it?” asked the prince, moving slowly backward from the pool.“Anything that you wish, for I am guarded by a fairy godmother who makes all things possible,” replied Yellow Lily.“I have come to give myself up to your father, the Giant of Loch Lein, according to my promise,” said the prince. “I would ask you to have him set me free. Here is your gown.”He laid the robe upon the grass and walked away up the hill towards the castle. In a few moments he was joined by Yellow Lily dressed in her golden robe.“You are the son of the King of Erin,” she said smiling sweetly, and catching step with him. “If you do as I say, you will not lose your head; but in the future I hope that you will never become so foolish as to wager your head or any other trifle you may have.”“I promise you that I will not,” said the prince, looking at her admiringly. “If your father had wagered your pretty golden head, I believe I could have beaten him at the game.”Yellow Lily tossed her curls and laughed merrily, saying: “Father has a soft bed for you in a deep tank; but do not worry, for I will help you.”They passed in silence through the stone gates of the Castle of Spikes. The great stone courts, balconies, and battlements were quite deserted. Yellow Lily took the prince into the kitchen, which was the largest one he had ever seen. The floor was made of white cobblestones, and a brass caldron boiled over the flames in the great fireplace. Yellow Lily hid the prince behind a curtain in one corner of the room.Presently the Giant of Loch Lein appeared and sank down into a chair before the fireplace. He began to sniff the air and finally roared:“The son of the King of Erin is here! Fetch him hither, Yellow Lily.”The girl did as she was bidden. The prince could not keep from trembling as he stood before the fierce giant, although he felt that Yellow Lily would keep her promise.“You must be very tired,” roared the giant, so loudly that the dishes on the shelves rattled. “I have a nice soft bed for you.”He seized the prince, carried him across the kitchen, opened a tank, and threw him in. Splash! The prince fell head-first into three feet of water.What was still more terrible, the giant fastened down the lid of the tank. The prince feared the dark far more than he did the water, but he did not cry out. He stood shivering for more than an hour, wondering if Yellow Lily had forgotten him, and wishing that he was safe at home in his bed of silk and gold.At last the lid was raised, and Yellow Lily peeped down at him, smiling roguishly.“Shall I steal your clothes and run away, as you tried to do today?” she said softly.“No, do not let me stay in this place. I will do anything you may want me to do,” pleaded the prince, with chattering teeth.“Then climb out; put on these dry, warm clothes I have for you; and have some supper,” she said.It did not take the prince long to get out of his soft bed. He found the giant sound asleep before the fireplace, snoring loud enough to drown the most terrible crash of thunder.Yellow Lily spoke not a word, but gave the prince some dry clothing and told him to stay in the corner until she returned. Before long she came back with a tempting supper smoking upon a tray, and told him to eat. He was very hungry and ate very heartily. Then she took him to another corner of the room and raised a curtain that hung there.He saw a soft, white bed and a table that held fresh water and towels. Yellow Lily wished him happy dreams and hastened away.At break of day she returned and said excitedly:“Awaken, Prince of Erin! Do not lose a moment or we are lost. Put on the clothes you wore yesterday and follow me.”The prince rose and dressed himself as quickly as possible. Then he drew back the curtain that hid his bed, and followed the girl.“When the chickens begin to cackle, father will awaken,” she whispered. “Leap back into the tank and I will shut down the lid.”The prince hesitated.“Do as I say, or we are both lost,” said the girl.The prince jumped into the tank, and Yellow Lily closed the lid. The splash aroused the giant, who stretched his heavy limbs, rubbed his nose, and yawned. Then he opened his eyes, gazed all about him, strode across the room, opened the tank, and shouted:“Good morning, Prince of Erin; how did you like your nice soft bed last night?”“I never slept better, thank you,” truthfully answered the prince.“Then climb out,” commanded the giant.The prince obeyed.“Since you have slept so soundly, you shall do some hard work to-day,” said the giant. “I will spare you your head if you will clean out my stables. They contain five hundred horses and they have not been cleaned for seven hundred years. I am anxious to find my great-grandmother’s slumber-pin which was lost somewhere in these stables. The poor old soul never slept a wink after losing it, so she died for want of sleep. I want the slumber-pin for my own use, as I am a very light sleeper.”“I will do my best to get the pin,” said the prince, almost discouraged, for he had never so much as cleaned the tips of his boots.“Here are two shovels, an old one and a new one,” said the giant gruffly. “You may take your choice. Dig away until you find the slumber-pin. I shall expect it when I come home to-night.”The prince took the new shovel and followed the giant to the stables where hundreds of horses began to neigh, making a most deafening noise.“Remember, Prince of Erin, I will either have the slumber-pin or your head,” said the giant, as he walked away.The prince set to work, but every time he threw a shovelful out of the window, two shovelfuls came flying in to take its place. At last, tired and discouraged, he sat down to rest.At that moment Yellow Lily appeared, more beautiful than ever in another gown of gold and silver, with yellow flowers in her golden hair.“What are you trying to do, Prince of Erin?” she asked, dimpling with laughter.“I am trying to find your great-great-grandmother’s slumber-pin,” was the pitiful reply.“You are a mighty prince and my father is a mighty giant, yet you are both foolish as all men are,” she said. “How do you suppose my great-great-grandmother could lose her slumber-pin in the stables? I have the slumber-pin myself; here it is. I put it in father’s pocket last night so he could not wake up and catch us.”“What a useful girl you are!” cried the Prince, beside himself with joy and admiration.All day long they visited until Yellow Lily said that she must go, for she heard her father’s footsteps a league away, and he would be there in two minutes.When the giant saw that the prince had found the slumber-pin, he was greatly surprised.“Either my daughter, Yellow Lily, has aided you, or else it was the Evil Spirit,” he muttered.Before the prince could reply, the giant picked him up, carried him back to the kitchen, and again threw him into the tank. Then he sat down by the fire, holding the slumber-pin. Soon he began to snore like a thousand locomotives.Up went the lid of the tank, and Yellow Lily, sweet and smiling, shouted down at the top of her voice:“Get up from your soft bed, Prince of Erin; eat the supper I have prepared, and talk as loudly as you wish, for father has gone to sleep holding great-great-grandmother’s slumber-pin.”The evening they spent together was a merry one, and after Yellow Lily had joined her sisters in the watch-tower, the prince again slept in the soft bed in the corner of the kitchen. At dawn Yellow Lily again awakened him and told him to hurry back to the tank.As soon as the lid was closed, Yellow Lily rushed to her father’s side, seized the slumber-pin, and threw it upon the floor. The giant gave a roar and fell sprawling upon the cobblestones.“Who woke me up?” he growled, trying to gain his feet.“I did, dear father,” said the girl meekly. “You would have slept forever had I not pulled the slumber-pin from your grasp. It is very late.”“You are a good, trustworthy daughter,” said the giant. “I will get you something pretty.”He went to the tank and commanded the prince to get out of his nice, soft bed.“You have lain in bed so long, you must work still harder to-day,” he added. “My stables have not been thatched for many years, and I want you to do it to-day. They cover many acres, but if you finish them before dark I will spare you your head. They must be thatched with feathers, to be put on one at a time, and no two of them must be alike.”The prince was again cast down, but he said that he would do his best.“But where shall I find the birds?” he asked after a period of helpless silence.“Where do you suppose? I hope you would not try to find them in the frog pond,” was the impatient answer. “Here are two whistles, an old one and a new one. You may take your choice.”“I’ll take the new one,” said the prince, and the giant gave him a whistle that looked as though it had never been used.“Some day you will learn that old things are best,” said the giant scornfully.When the giant had gone, the prince blew the whistle until his lips were puckered out of shape, but not a fowl came to his rescue. At last he sat down upon a rock, almost ready to cry.But Yellow Lily came again, lovelier than ever in another yellow gown trimmed with the wings of dragon flies, and with pearls in her glorious hair.“Why do you sit whistling instead of working?” she asked. “Poor prince, you must be hungry. Here is a little table set for two under this big tree. When things worry you, don’t give up. The man who keeps his appetite has no cause to despair.”So they sat down and ate peacock tongues and frosted cakes and almonds and many other delicacies, and were happier than ever.“But it is growing late, and the stable is still unthatched!” cried the prince, suddenly remembering his task as soon as his appetite was satisfied.“Look behind you,” said the girl.The prince, to his utter surprise, saw that the stables were thatched with downy bird feathers, no two of them alike.“You are a wonder,” he said, grasping her hands in gratitude.“Not at all,” she replied. “How could the birds work for you while you stood there blowing that terrible whistle? Birds would be as good friends to people as dogs are, if people did not frighten them so. But say no more. I hear father drinking at the spring two miles away, and he will be here in four minutes.”She drew her skirts closely about her and with a sweet smile hastened into the castle.“Who thatched that roof?” shouted the giant as soon as he arrived.“My own strength did it,” said the prince humbly, feeling that he had not told a falsehood, for Yellow Lily was even more than strength to him.The giant, instead of thanking him for his services, seized him again, and threw him headlong into the kitchen tank. Then he sat down by the fire. No sooner had his head begun to nod than Yellow Lily placed the slumber-pin over his nose to be sure that he could not wake up. Then she set the prince free, and they spent the evening as before, except that there was much more merriment.On the following morning the giant opened the tank and ordered the prince to climb out.“I have a task for you to do that even a prince cannot do,” he said. “I am sure that I shall have your head before night. Near the castle is a tree nine hundred feet high. It has but one branch and that is near the top. This branch contains a crow’s nest. In the nest is one egg. I want that egg for supper tonight. If you do not get it, you will be sorry.”The giant took the prince to the tree, which rose like a great pillar of smooth glass, so slippery that not even an ant could crawl upon it without sliding off.When the giant had gone, the prince tried a dozen times to climb to the top, but each time he slipped back to the earth quicker and harder than before. He was glad indeed when Yellow Lily came.And now comes the bloodcurdling part of the tale that I would rather omit; but I must tell it all to you just as the dear little Irish children heard it centuries ago, or I should feel that I had marred this ancient bit of fairy folklore.Yellow Lily, as usual, brought something to eat, and after they had eaten, she, for the first time, turned upon the prince a sorrowful face.“I am sorry father gave you this task to do; but we must submit to what cannot be helped,” she said. “Alas! dear prince, you must kill me.”“Kill you!” he cried in horror. “Never! I would rather lose my head a thousand times.”“But, if you are careful, I shall come to life again,” persisted the girl. “My fairy godmother will care for me. You will find it easy to strip off my flesh, for you have only to say, ‘Yellow Lily of Loch Lein.’ Say it again and my bones will all separate. You will find that my bones will stick to this tree like little steps. On the ladder of bones you can climb to the top of the tree. Get the egg and climb down carefully, each time pulling one of my bones from the tree until you have reached the earth. Then pile the bones in a heap upon my flesh and say, ‘Come back, Yellow Lily of Loch Lein,’ and lo! I will be myself again. But be careful—be careful not to leave one of my bones on the tree.”For a long time the prince refused to obey her request until Yellow Lily grew vexed and said:“Then I will tell father that I have been helping you, and he will kill us both. Make haste, for the time is short.”“Yellow Lily of Loch Lein!” shouted the prince, without looking at her. “Yellow Lily of Loch Lein!” he shouted again.Then he looked down and saw at his feet a stack of little white bones. He gathered them up and, climbing slowly, made a little ladder by sticking them against the tree. He soon reached the crow’s nest, found the egg, placed it in his pocket, and climbed down again, plucking the bones from the tree as he went. Then he piled them upon the flesh and garments of the girl and, with tears in his eyes, shouted:“Come back, Yellow Lily of Loch Lein.”And immediately Yellow Lily stood before him, but no longer smiling.“Wretch!” she cried. “You have made me a cripple for life! You are nothing but a careless boy after all.”“Oh, what have I neglected to do?” cried the prince, sick with fear.“There is one of my little toes still hanging to the tree. Oh, what an awkward creature a prince is!”The prince on his knees begged her pardon, and finally Yellow Lily broke into her old, sweet smile and said:“I am thankful it is no worse. What a sight I would be if you had forgotten my backbone!”So they became merry and talkative again until it was time for the giant to arrive. Then Yellow Lily went to her tower and the prince took his stand at the castle gate holding the crow’s egg.“You are certainly a magician!” gasped the giant when he saw the prince. “I cannot take your head, lest a worse fate befall me. Go home at once. Do not linger here a minute.”The prince wanted to bid farewell to Yellow Lily, but of course, that was impossible, so he hastened home as fast as he could.When he reached the Palace of Erin, the king, the queen, old Glic, and all the court ran out to greet him. Never before had there been such rejoicing there. For days they feasted and danced to melodious music, and a tournament was held in which the best archers in the kingdom tested their skill.A year later, old Glic, who was always making trouble, told the king that it was time for the prince to marry some noble lady of great wealth. The prince would have liked to marry Yellow Lily, but the king said that he must choose a princess whose rank was equal to his own. In despair the prince told Glic to select him a wife soon or he would go roaming again and never return.“I have found a suitable lady,” said Glic. “Her father is the King of Loch Lein, the kingdom that is next to ours. Her father is powerful, her family is famous, her wealth cannot be counted, and she is as beautiful as the Queen of the Fairies.”“If she will have me, I will marry her,” said the prince, “but I will not seek her myself.”The king sent Glic to the court of Loch Lein, bearing rich gifts and guarded by soldiers and attendants. In a few weeks he returned and told the King of Erin that the King of Loch Lein had consented to give the prince his daughter in marriage.Preparations were at once made for a great wedding. All kinds of sports, several dances, and other amusements were to be enjoyed at court, and the royal families of many different kingdoms, even from the isles of the sea, were to be present.The prince himself finally grew much interested in getting ready for the great event. In fact he almost forgot about Yellow Lily and the help she had given him to save his head. Yet he bade his father invite the Giant of Loch Lein to be present at the feast to be given before the day of the wedding. It was also agreed to invite Blue Lily, White Lily, and Yellow Lily, and to treat them as princesses of the royal blood.In time the King of Loch Lein, who was an aged man, arrived with his daughter and a shipful of attendants. The gatekeeper blew his bugle and the whole court of Erin ran out to greet them. The King and Princess of Loch Lein were taken into the reception hall where the Queen and Prince of Erin welcomed them.The prince was much disappointed when he beheld the princess, and was very angry with Glic, for she was haughty and not at all pretty. She seemed to be more pleased with the costly furniture and tapestries than with the prince.The day of the feast came at last. The table in the banquet hall was loaded with fruits and costly meats of all kinds to be served upon plates of solid gold. Every one appeared to be happy, especially old Glic, who was to receive a large sum of money for finding the prince a wife.At the close of the feast, the King of Erin sang a ballad and the King of Loch Lein told a story. In those days the people were fond of deeds of magic, so the prince requested Glic to call the mighty Giant of Loch Lein, that he might perform some tricks.In a few moments the giant entered the room, bowing sternly as the people clapped their hands and cheered. He did not look at the prince but bowed low to the two kings.“Your Majesties,” he said, “it is my daughter who is the real magician. I know that she will be glad to entertain you for a short time. In fact she has consented to take my place.”Just then Yellow Lily entered the room in a gown of gold that swept the floor. Her golden hair shone like the sun. No one present had ever seen such glorious hair nor such a beautiful face and form. All were too much amazed at her beauty and elegance to utter a word of welcome.Yellow Lily sat down at the table and threw two grains of wheat into the air. They lit upon the table and turned into a male and a female pigeon. Immediately the former began to peck at his mate, almost driving her from the table. To the surprise of all, the female pigeon shrieked:“You didn’t treat me thus on the day I cleaned the stable for you and found the slumber-pin.”Yellow Lily laid two grains of wheat before them, but the male pigeon greedily devoured them and continued to abuse his mate.“You would not have done that to me the day I thatched the stables for you with the feathers of birds, and no two of them alike,” shrieked the female pigeon.When some more wheat was laid before them, the male pigeon ate more greedily than before, and after he had eaten every grain he pushed his mate off the table. She fluttered to the floor screaming:“You wouldn’t have done that the day you killed me and took my bones to make steps on the glass tree nine hundred feet high, to get the crow’s egg for the supper of the Giant of Loch Lein—and forgot my little toe, and made me lame for life!”The Prince of Erin rose to his feet, red with shame, and turning to the King of Loch Lein, said:“When I was younger I roamed about hunting and playing games. Once while away from home, I lost the key to a valuable chest. After a new key was made I found the old one. Which of the two keys should be kept, the old one or the new one?”The King of Loch Lein looked puzzled, but he answered promptly:“Keep the old one by all means, for it will fit better and you are more accustomed to it.”“I thank you for your sound advice,” continued the prince with a smile. “Yellow Lily, the daughter of the Giant of Loch Lein, is the old key to my heart, and I will wed no other girl. Your daughter, the princess, is the new key that has never been tried. She is only my father’s guest, and no more; but she will be better for having attended my happy wedding in Erin.”Great astonishment of both royal families and their guests when the prince took Yellow Lily by the hand and led her to a seat beside him. But when the musicians began to play a brilliant air, the palace re-echoed from tower to dungeon with joyous shouts of “Long live the Prince of Erin and his future bride, Yellow Lily of Loch Lein!”","['upon', 'time', 'fairy', 'plentiful', 'dandelion', 'meadow', 'dwelt', 'ireland', 'mighty', 'king', 'good', 'queen', 'name', 'great', 'ruler', 'long', 'since', 'forgotten', 'writer',

658,irish,Fin MacCumhail and the Son of the King of Alba,"On a day Fin went out hunting with his dog Bran, on Knock an Ar; and he killed so much game that he didn’t know what to do with it or how to bring it home. As he stood looking and thinking, all at once he saw a man running towards him, with a rope around his waist so long that half his body was covered with it; and the man was of such size that, as he ran, Fin could see the whole world between his legs and nothing between his head and the sky. When he came up, the man saluted Fin, who answered him most kindly. “Where are you going?” asked Fin. “I am out looking for a master.” “Well,” said Fin, “I am in sore need of a man; what can you do?” “Do you see this rope on my body? Whatever this rope will bind I can carry.” “If that is true,” said Fin, “you are the man I want. Do you see the game on this hillside?” “I do,” said the man. “Well, put that into the rope and carry it to my castle.”The man put all the game into the rope, made a great bundle, and threw it on his back.“Show me the way to the castle now,” said he. Fin started on ahead, and though he ran with all his might, he could not gain one step on the man who followed with the game. The sentry on guard at the castle saw the man running while yet far off. He stepped inside the gate and said: “There is a man coming with a load on his back as big as a mountain.” Before he could come out again to his place the man was there and the load off his back. When the game came to the ground, it shook the castle to its foundations. Next day the man was sent to herd cows for a time, and while he was gone, Conán Maol said to Fin: “If you don’t put this cowherd to death, he will destroy all the Fenians of Erin.” “How could I put such a good man to death?” asked Fin. “Send him,” said Conán, “to sow corn on the brink of a lake in the north of Erin. Now, in that lake lives a serpent that never lets a person pass, but swallows every man that goes that way.” Fin agreed to this, and the next morning after breakfast he called the man, gave him seven bullocks, a plough, and a sack of grain, and sent him to the lake in the north of Erin to sow corn. When he came to the lake, the man started to plough, drew one furrow. The lake began to boil up, and as he was coming back, making the second furrow, the serpent was on the field before him and swallowed the seven bullocks and the plough up to the handles. But the man held fast to what he had in his two hands, gave a pull, and dragged the plough and six of the bullocks out of the belly of the serpent. The seventh one remained inside. The serpent went at him and they fought for seven days and nights. At the end of that time the serpent was as tame as a cat, and the man drove him and the six bullocks home before him.When he was in sight of Fin’s castle, the sentry at the gate ran in and cried: “That cowherd is coming with the size of a mountain before him!” “Run out,” said Conán Maol, “and tell him to tie the serpent to that oak out there.”They ran out, and the man tied the serpent to the oak-tree, then came in and had a good supper.Next morning the man went out to herd cows as before. “Well,” said Conán Maol to Fin, “if you don’t put this man to death, he’ll destroy you and me and all the Fenians of Erin.”“How could I put such a man to death?”“There is,” said Conán, “a bullock in the north of Erin, and he drives fog out of himself for seven days and then he draws it in for seven other days. To-morrow is the last day for drawing it in. If any one man comes near, he’ll swallow him alive.”When the cowherd came to supper in the evening, Fin said to him: “I am going to have a feast and need fresh beef. Now there is a bullock in that same valley by the lake in the north of Erin where you punished the serpent; and if you go there and bring the bullock to me, you’ll have my thanks.”“I’ll go,” said the man, “the first thing after breakfast in the morning.”So off he went next morning; and when he came near the valley, he found the bullock asleep and drawing in the last of the fog; and soon he found himself going in with it. So he caught hold of a great oak-tree for safety. The bullock woke up then and saw him, and letting a roar out of himself, faced him, and gave him a pitch with his horn which sent him seven miles over the top of a wood. And when he fell to the ground, the bullock was on him again before he had time to rise, and gave him another pitch which sent him back and broke three ribs in his body.“This will never do,” said the man, as he rose, and pulling up an oak-tree by the roots for a club, he faced the bullock. And there they were at one another for five days and nights, till the bullock was as tame as a cat and the man drove him home to Fin’s castle. The sentry saw them coming and ran inside the gate with word. “Tell the man to tie the bullock to that oak-tree beyond,” said Conán. “We don’t want him near this place.” The cowherd tied the bullock, and told Fin to send four of the best butchers in Erin to kill him with an axe; and the four of them struck him one after another and any of them couldn’t knock him.“Give me an axe,” said the man to the butchers. They gave him the axe, and the first stroke he gave, he knocked the bullock. Then they began to skin him; but the man didn’t like the way they were doing the work, so he took his sword and had three quarters of the bullock skinned before they could skin one.Next morning the cowherd went out with the cows; but he wasn’t long gone when Conán Maol came to Fin and said: “If you don’t put an end to that man, he’ll soon put an end to you and to me and to all of us, so there won’t be a man of the Fenians of Erin left alive.”“How could I put an end to a man like him?” asked Fin.“There is in the north of Erin,” said Conán, “a wild sow who has two great pigs of her own; and she and her two pigs have bags of poison in their tails; and when they see any man, they run at him and shake their poison bags; and if the smallest drop of the poison touches him, it is death to him that minute. And, if by any chance he should escape the wild sow and the pigs, there is a fox-man called the Gruagach, who has but one eye and that in the middle of his forehead. The Gruagach carries a club of a ton weight, and if the cowherd gets one welt of that club, he’ll never trouble the Fenians of Erin again.”Next morning Fin called up the cowherd and said, “I am going to have a feast in this castle, and I would like to have some fresh pork. There is a wild sow in the north of Erin with two pigs, and if you bring her to me before the feast, you’ll have my thanks.”“I’ll go and bring her to you,” said the cowherd. So after breakfast he took his sword, went to the north of Erin, and stole up to the sow and two pigs, and whipped the tails off the three of them, before they knew he was in it. Then he faced the wild sow and fought with her for four days and five nights, and on the morning of the fifth day he knocked her dead. At the last blow, his sword stuck in her backbone and he couldn’t draw it out. But with one pull he broke the blade, and stood there over her with only the hilt in his hand. Then he put his foot on one of her jaws, took the other in his hands, and splitting her evenly from the nose to the tail, made two halves of her.He threw one half on his shoulder; and that minute the big Gruagach with one eye in his head came along and made an offer of his club at him to kill him. But the cowherd jumped aside, and catching the Gruagach by one of his legs, threw him up on to the half of the wild sow on his shoulder, and taking the other half of her from the ground, clapped that on the top of the Gruagach, and ran away to Fin’s castle as fast as his legs could carry him.The sentry at the castle gate ran in and said: “The cowherd is running to the castle, and the size of a mountain on his back.” “Go out now,” said Conán Maol, “and stop him where he is, or he’ll throw down the castle if he comes here with the load that’s on him.” But before the sentry was back at his place, the cowherd was at the gate shaking the load off his back and the castle to its foundations, so that every dish and vessel in it was broken to bits.The Gruagach jumped from the ground, rubbed his legs and every part of him that was sore from the treatment he got. He was so much in dread of the cowherd that he ran with all the strength that was in him, and never stopped to look back till he was in the north of Erin.Next morning the cowherd went out with the cows, drove them back in the evening, and while picking the thigh-bone of a bullock for his supper, Oscar, son of Oisin, the strongest man of the Fenians of Erin, came up to him and took hold of the bone to pull it from his hand. The cowherd held one end and Oscar the other, and pulled till they made two halves of the bone. “What did you carry away?” asked the cowherd. “What I have in my hand,” said Oscar. “And I kept what I held in my fist,” said the cowherd. “There is that for you now,” said Oscar, and he hit him a slap.The cowherd said no word in answer, but next morning he asked his wages of Fin. “Oh, then,” said Fin, “I’ll pay you and welcome, for you are the best man I have ever had or met with.”Then the cowherd went away to Cahirciveen in Kerry where he had an enchanted castle. But before he went he invited Fin MacCumhail and the Fenians of Erin to have a great feast with him. “For,” said he to Fin, “I’m not a cowherd at all, but the son of the king of Alba, and I’ll give you good cheer.”When the Fenians came to the place, they found the finest castle that could be seen. There were three fires in each room and seven spits at every fire. When they had gone and sat down in their places, there was but one fire in each room. “Rise up, every man of you,” said Fin, “or we are lost; for this is an enchanted place.”They tried to rise, but each man was fastened to his seat, and the seat to the floor; and not one of them could stir. Then the last fire went out and they were in darkness.“Chew your thumb,” said Conán to Fin, “and try is there any way out of here.” Fin chewed his thumb and knew what trouble they were in. Then he put his two hands into his mouth and blew the old-time whistle. And this whistle was heard by Pogán and Ceolán, two sons of Fin who were in the North at that time, one fishing and the other hurling.When they heard the whistle, they said: “Our father and the Fenians of Erin are in trouble.” And they faced towards the sound and never stopped till they knocked at the door of the enchanted castle of the son of Alba at Cahirciveen.“Who is there?” asked Fin.“Your two sons,” said one of them.“Well,” said Fin, “we are in danger of death to-night. That cowherd I had in my service was no cowherd at all, but the son of the king of Alba; and his father has said that he will not eat three meals off one table without having my head. There is an army now on the road to kill us to-night. There is no way in or out of this castle but by one ford, and to that ford the army of the king of Alba is coming.”The two sons of Fin went out at nightfall and stood in the ford before the army. The son of the king of Alba knew them well, and calling each by name, said: “Won’t you let us pass?” “We will not,” said they; and then the fight began. The two sons of Fin MacCumhail, Pogán and Ceolán, destroyed the whole army and killed every man except the son of the king of Alba.After the battle the two went back to their father. “We have destroyed the whole army at the ford,” said they.“There is a greater danger ahead,” said Fin. “There is an old hag coming with a little pot. She will dip her finger in the pot, touch the lips of the dead men, and bring the whole army to life. But first of all there will be music at the ford, and if you hear the music, you’ll fall asleep. Now go, but if you do not overpower the old hag, we are lost.”“We’ll do the best we can,” said the two sons of Fin.They were not long at the ford when one said, “I am falling asleep from that music.” “So am I,” said the other. “Knock your foot down on mine,” said the first. The other kicked his foot and struck him, but no use. Then each took his spear and drove it through the foot of the other, but both fell asleep in spite of the spears.The old hag went on touching the lips of the dead men, who stood up alive; and she was crossing the ford at the head of the army when she stumbled over the two sleeping brothers and spilt what was in the pot over their bodies.They sprang up fresh and well, and picking up two stones of a ton weight each that were there in the ford, they made for the champions of Alban and never stopped till they killed the last man of them; and then they killed the old hag herself.Pogán and Ceolán then knocked at the door of the castle.“Who’s there?” asked Fin.“Your two sons,” said they; “and we have killed all the champions of Alban and the old hag as well.” “You have more to do yet,” said Fin. “There are three kings in the north of Erin who have three silver goblets. These kings are holding a feast in a fort to-day. You must go and cut the heads off the three, put their blood in the goblets and bring them here. When you come, rub the blood on the keyhole of the door and it will open before you. When you come in, rub the seats and we shall all be free.”The three goblets of blood were brought to Cahirciveen, the door of the castle flew open, and light came into every room. The brothers rubbed blood on the chairs of all the Fenians of Erin and freed them all, except Conán Maol, who had no chair, but sat on the floor with his back to the wall. When they came to him the last drop of blood was gone.All the Fenians of Erin were hurrying past, anxious to escape, and paid no heed to Conán, who had never a good word in his mouth for any man. Then Conán turned to Diarmuid, and said: “If a woman were here in place of me, you wouldn’t leave her to die this way.” Then Diarmuid turned, took him by one hand, and Goll MacMorna by the other, and pulling with all their might, tore him from the wall and the floor. But if they did, he left all the skin of his back from his head to his heels on the floor and the wall behind him. But when they were going home through the hills of Tralee, they found a sheep on the way, killed it, and clapped the skin on Conán. The sheepskin grew to his body; and he was so well and strong that they sheared him every year, and got wool enough from his back to make flannel and frieze for the Fenians of Erin ever after.","['hunt', 'bran', 'knock', 'kill', 'much', 'game', 'know', 'bring', 'home', 'stood', 'look', 'think', 'towards', 'rope', 'around', 'waist', 'long', 'half', 'body', 'cover', 'size', 'could',

722,irish,The Devoted Friend,"One morning the old Water-rat put his head out of his hole.  He had bright beady eyes and stiff grey whiskers and his tail was like a long bit of black india-rubber.  The little ducks were swimming about in the pond, looking just like a lot of yellow canaries, and their mother, who was pure white with real red legs, was trying to teach them how to stand on their heads in the water.“You will never be in the best society unless you can stand on your heads,” she kept saying to them; and every now and then she showed them how it was done.  But the little ducks paid no attention to her.  They were so young that they did not know what an advantage it is to be in society at all.“What disobedient children!” cried the old Water-rat; “they really deserve to be drowned.”“Nothing of the kind,” answered the Duck, “every one must make a beginning, and parents cannot be too patient.”“Ah! I know nothing about the feelings of parents,” said the Water-rat; “I am not a family man.  In fact, I have never been married, and I never intend to be.  Love is all very well in its way, but friendship is much higher.  Indeed, I know of nothing in the world that is either nobler or rarer than a devoted friendship.”“And what, pray, is your idea of the duties of a devoted friend?” asked a Green Linnet, who was sitting in a willow-tree hard by, and had overheard the conversation.“Yes, that is just what I want to know,” said the Duck; and she swam away to the end of the pond, and stood upon her head, in order to give her children a good example.“What a silly question!” cried the Water-rat.  “I should expect my devoted friend to be devoted to me, of course.”“And what would you do in return?” said the little bird, swinging upon a silver spray, and flapping his tiny wings.“I don’t understand you,” answered the Water-rat.“Let me tell you a story on the subject,” said the Linnet.“Is the story about me?” asked the Water-rat.  “If so, I will listen to it, for I am extremely fond of fiction.”“It is applicable to you,” answered the Linnet; and he flew down, and alighting upon the bank, he told the story of The Devoted Friend.“Once upon a time,” said the Linnet, “there was an honest little fellow named Hans.”“Was he very distinguished?” asked the Water-rat.“No,” answered the Linnet, “I don’t think he was distinguished at all, except for his kind heart, and his funny round good-humoured face.  He lived in a tiny cottage all by himself, and every day he worked in his garden.  In all the country-side there was no garden so lovely as his.  Sweet-william grew there, and Gilly-flowers, and Shepherds’-purses, and Fair-maids of France.  There were damask Roses, and yellow Roses, lilac Crocuses, and gold, purple Violets and white.  Columbine and Ladysmock, Marjoram and Wild Basil, the Cowslip and the Flower-de-luce, the Daffodil and the Clove-Pink bloomed or blossomed in their proper order as the months went by, one flower taking another flower’s place, so that there were always beautiful things to look at, and pleasant odours to smell.“Little Hans had a great many friends, but the most devoted friend of all was big Hugh the Miller.  Indeed, so devoted was the rich Miller to little Hans, that he would never go by his garden without leaning over the wall and plucking a large nosegay, or a handful of sweet herbs, or filling his pockets with plums and cherries if it was the fruit season.“‘Real friends should have everything in common,’ the Miller used to say, and little Hans nodded and smiled, and felt very proud of having a friend with such noble ideas.“Sometimes, indeed, the neighbours thought it strange that the rich Miller never gave little Hans anything in return, though he had a hundred sacks of flour stored away in his mill, and six milch cows, and a large flock of woolly sheep; but Hans never troubled his head about these things, and nothing gave him greater pleasure than to listen to all the wonderful things the Miller used to say about the unselfishness of true friendship.“So little Hans worked away in his garden.  During the spring, the summer, and the autumn he was very happy, but when the winter came, and he had no fruit or flowers to bring to the market, he suffered a good deal from cold and hunger, and often had to go to bed without any supper but a few dried pears or some hard nuts.  In the winter, also, he was extremely lonely, as the Miller never came to see him then.“‘There is no good in my going to see little Hans as long as the snow lasts,’ the Miller used to say to his wife, ‘for when people are in trouble they should be left alone, and not be bothered by visitors.  That at least is my idea about friendship, and I am sure I am right.  So I shall wait till the spring comes, and then I shall pay him a visit, and he will be able to give me a large basket of primroses and that will make him so happy.’“‘You are certainly very thoughtful about others,’ answered the Wife, as she sat in her comfortable armchair by the big pinewood fire; ‘very thoughtful indeed.  It is quite a treat to hear you talk about friendship.  I am sure the clergyman himself could not say such beautiful things as you do, though he does live in a three-storied house, and wear a gold ring on his little finger.’“‘But could we not ask little Hans up here?’ said the Miller’s youngest son.  ‘If poor Hans is in trouble I will give him half my porridge, and show him my white rabbits.’“‘What a silly boy you are!’ cried the Miller; ‘I really don’t know what is the use of sending you to school.  You seem not to learn anything.  Why, if little Hans came up here, and saw our warm fire, and our good supper, and our great cask of red wine, he might get envious, and envy is a most terrible thing, and would spoil anybody’s nature.  I certainly will not allow Hans’ nature to be spoiled.  I am his best friend, and I will always watch over him, and see that he is not led into any temptations.  Besides, if Hans came here, he might ask me to let him have some flour on credit, and that I could not do.  Flour is one thing, and friendship is another, and they should not be confused.  Why, the words are spelt differently, and mean quite different things.  Everybody can see that.’“‘How well you talk!’ said the Miller’s Wife, pouring herself out a large glass of warm ale; ‘really I feel quite drowsy.  It is just like being in church.’“‘Lots of people act well,’ answered the Miller; ‘but very few people talk well, which shows that talking is much the more difficult thing of the two, and much the finer thing also’; and he looked sternly across the table at his little son, who felt so ashamed of himself that he hung his head down, and grew quite scarlet, and began to cry into his tea.  However, he was so young that you must excuse him.”“Is that the end of the story?” asked the Water-rat.“Certainly not,” answered the Linnet, “that is the beginning.”“Then you are quite behind the age,” said the Water-rat.  “Every good story-teller nowadays starts with the end, and then goes on to the beginning, and concludes with the middle.  That is the new method.  I heard all about it the other day from a critic who was walking round the pond with a young man.  He spoke of the matter at great length, and I am sure he must have been right, for he had blue spectacles and a bald head, and whenever the young man made any remark, he always answered ‘Pooh!’  But pray go on with your story.  I like the Miller immensely.  I have all kinds of beautiful sentiments myself, so there is a great sympathy between us.”“Well,” said the Linnet, hopping now on one leg and now on the other, “as soon as the winter was over, and the primroses began to open their pale yellow stars, the Miller said to his wife that he would go down and see little Hans.“‘Why, what a good heart you have!’ cried his Wife; ‘you are always thinking of others.  And mind you take the big basket with you for the flowers.’“So the Miller tied the sails of the windmill together with a strong iron chain, and went down the hill with the basket on his arm.“‘Good morning, little Hans,’ said the Miller.“‘Good morning,’ said Hans, leaning on his spade, and smiling from ear to ear.“‘And how have you been all the winter?’ said the Miller.“‘Well, really,’ cried Hans, ‘it is very good of you to ask, very good indeed.  I am afraid I had rather a hard time of it, but now the spring has come, and I am quite happy, and all my flowers are doing well.’“‘We often talked of you during the winter, Hans,’ said the Miller, ‘and wondered how you were getting on.’“‘That was kind of you,’ said Hans; ‘I was half afraid you had forgotten me.’“‘Hans, I am surprised at you,’ said the Miller; ‘friendship never forgets.  That is the wonderful thing about it, but I am afraid you don’t understand the poetry of life.  How lovely your primroses are looking, by-the-bye!”“‘They are certainly very lovely,’ said Hans, ‘and it is a most lucky thing for me that I have so many.  I am going to bring them into the market and sell them to the Burgomaster’s daughter, and buy back my wheelbarrow with the money.’“‘Buy back your wheelbarrow?  You don’t mean to say you have sold it?  What a very stupid thing to do!’“‘Well, the fact is,’ said Hans, ‘that I was obliged to.  You see the winter was a very bad time for me, and I really had no money at all to buy bread with.  So I first sold the silver buttons off my Sunday coat, and then I sold my silver chain, and then I sold my big pipe, and at last I sold my wheelbarrow.  But I am going to buy them all back again now.’“‘Hans,’ said the Miller, ‘I will give you my wheelbarrow.  It is not in very good repair; indeed, one side is gone, and there is something wrong with the wheel-spokes; but in spite of that I will give it to you.  I know it is very generous of me, and a great many people would think me extremely foolish for parting with it, but I am not like the rest of the world.  I think that generosity is the essence of friendship, and, besides, I have got a new wheelbarrow for myself.  Yes, you may set your mind at ease, I will give you my wheelbarrow.’“‘Well, really, that is generous of you,’ said little Hans, and his funny round face glowed all over with pleasure.  ‘I can easily put it in repair, as I have a plank of wood in the house.’“‘A plank of wood!’ said the Miller; ‘why, that is just what I want for the roof of my barn.  There is a very large hole in it, and the corn will all get damp if I don’t stop it up.  How lucky you mentioned it!  It is quite remarkable how one good action always breeds another.  I have given you my wheelbarrow, and now you are going to give me your plank.  Of course, the wheelbarrow is worth far more than the plank, but true, friendship never notices things like that.  Pray get it at once, and I will set to work at my barn this very day.’“‘Certainly,’ cried little Hans, and he ran into the shed and dragged the plank out.“‘It is not a very big plank,’ said the Miller, looking at it, ‘and I am afraid that after I have mended my barn-roof there won’t be any left for you to mend the wheelbarrow with; but, of course, that is not my fault.  And now, as I have given you my wheelbarrow, I am sure you would like to give me some flowers in return.  Here is the basket, and mind you fill it quite full.’“‘Quite full?’ said little Hans, rather sorrowfully, for it was really a very big basket, and he knew that if he filled it he would have no flowers left for the market and he was very anxious to get his silver buttons back.“‘Well, really,’ answered the Miller, ‘as I have given you my wheelbarrow, I don’t think that it is much to ask you for a few flowers.  I may be wrong, but I should have thought that friendship, true friendship, was quite free from selfishness of any kind.’“‘My dear friend, my best friend,’ cried little Hans, ‘you are welcome to all the flowers in my garden.  I would much sooner have your good opinion than my silver buttons, any day’; and he ran and plucked all his pretty primroses, and filled the Miller’s basket.“‘Good-bye, little Hans,’ said the Miller, as he went up the hill with the plank on his shoulder, and the big basket in his hand.“‘Good-bye,’ said little Hans, and he began to dig away quite merrily, he was so pleased about the wheelbarrow.“The next day he was nailing up some honeysuckle against the porch, when he heard the Miller’s voice calling to him from the road.  So he jumped off the ladder, and ran down the garden, and looked over the wall.“There was the Miller with a large sack of flour on his back.“‘Dear little Hans,’ said the Miller, ‘would you mind carrying this sack of flour for me to market?’“‘Oh, I am so sorry,’ said Hans, ‘but I am really very busy to-day.  I have got all my creepers to nail up, and all my flowers to water, and all my grass to roll.’“‘Well, really,’ said the Miller, ‘I think that, considering that I am going to give you my wheelbarrow, it is rather unfriendly of you to refuse.’“‘Oh, don’t say that,’ cried little Hans, ‘I wouldn’t be unfriendly for the whole world’; and he ran in for his cap, and trudged off with the big sack on his shoulders.“It was a very hot day, and the road was terribly dusty, and before Hans had reached the sixth milestone he was so tired that he had to sit down and rest.  However, he went on bravely, and as last he reached the market.  After he had waited there some time, he sold the sack of flour for a very good price, and then he returned home at once, for he was afraid that if he stopped too late he might meet some robbers on the way.“‘It has certainly been a hard day,’ said little Hans to himself as he was going to bed, ‘but I am glad I did not refuse the Miller, for he is my best friend, and, besides, he is going to give me his wheelbarrow.’“Early the next morning the Miller came down to get the money for his sack of flour, but little Hans was so tired that he was still in bed.“‘Upon my word,’ said the Miller, ‘you are very lazy.  Really, considering that I am going to give you my wheelbarrow, I think you might work harder.  Idleness is a great sin, and I certainly don’t like any of my friends to be idle or sluggish.  You must not mind my speaking quite plainly to you.  Of course I should not dream of doing so if I were not your friend.  But what is the good of friendship if one cannot say exactly what one means?  Anybody can say charming things and try to please and to flatter, but a true friend always says unpleasant things, and does not mind giving pain.  Indeed, if he is a really true friend he prefers it, for he knows that then he is doing good.’“‘I am very sorry,’ said little Hans, rubbing his eyes and pulling off his night-cap, ‘but I was so tired that I thought I would lie in bed for a little time, and listen to the birds singing.  Do you know that I always work better after hearing the birds sing?’“‘Well, I am glad of that,’ said the Miller, clapping little Hans on the back, ‘for I want you to come up to the mill as soon as you are dressed, and mend my barn-roof for me.’“Poor little Hans was very anxious to go and work in his garden, for his flowers had not been watered for two days, but he did not like to refuse the Miller, as he was such a good friend to him.“‘Do you think it would be unfriendly of me if I said I was busy?’ he inquired in a shy and timid voice.“‘Well, really,’ answered the Miller, ‘I do not think it is much to ask of you, considering that I am going to give you my wheelbarrow; but of course if you refuse I will go and do it myself.’“‘Oh! on no account,’ cried little Hans and he jumped out of bed, and dressed himself, and went up to the barn.“He worked there all day long, till sunset, and at sunset the Miller came to see how he was getting on.“‘Have you mended the hole in the roof yet, little Hans?’ cried the Miller in a cheery voice.“‘It is quite mended,’ answered little Hans, coming down the ladder.“‘Ah!’ said the Miller, ‘there is no work so delightful as the work one does for others.’“‘It is certainly a great privilege to hear you talk,’ answered little Hans, sitting down, and wiping his forehead, ‘a very great privilege.  But I am afraid I shall never have such beautiful ideas as you have.’“‘Oh! they will come to you,’ said the Miller, ‘but you must take more pains.  At present you have only the practice of friendship; some day you will have the theory also.’“‘Do you really think I shall?’ asked little Hans.“‘I have no doubt of it,’ answered the Miller, ‘but now that you have mended the roof, you had better go home and rest, for I want you to drive my sheep to the mountain to-morrow.’“Poor little Hans was afraid to say anything to this, and early the next morning the Miller brought his sheep round to the cottage, and Hans started off with them to the mountain.  It took him the whole day to get there and back; and when he returned he was so tired that he went off to sleep in his chair, and did not wake up till it was broad daylight.“‘What a delightful time I shall have in my garden,’ he said, and he went to work at once.“But somehow he was never able to look after his flowers at all, for his friend the Miller was always coming round and sending him off on long errands, or getting him to help at the mill.  Little Hans was very much distressed at times, as he was afraid his flowers would think he had forgotten them, but he consoled himself by the reflection that the Miller was his best friend.  ‘Besides,’ he used to say, ‘he is going to give me his wheelbarrow, and that is an act of pure generosity.’“So little Hans worked away for the Miller, and the Miller said all kinds of beautiful things about friendship, which Hans took down in a note-book, and used to read over at night, for he was a very good scholar.“Now it happened that one evening little Hans was sitting by his fireside when a loud rap came at the door.  It was a very wild night, and the wind was blowing and roaring round the house so terribly that at first he thought it was merely the storm.  But a second rap came, and then a third, louder than any of the others.“‘It is some poor traveller,’ said little Hans to himself, and he ran to the door.“There stood the Miller with a lantern in one hand and a big stick in the other.“‘Dear little Hans,’ cried the Miller, ‘I am in great trouble.  My little boy has fallen off a ladder and hurt himself, and I am going for the Doctor.  But he lives so far away, and it is such a bad night, that it has just occurred to me that it would be much better if you went instead of me.  You know I am going to give you my wheelbarrow, and so, it is only fair that you should do something for me in return.’“‘Certainly,’ cried little Hans, ‘I take it quite as a compliment your coming to me, and I will start off at once.  But you must lend me your lantern, as the night is so dark that I am afraid I might fall into the ditch.’“‘I am very sorry,’ answered the Miller, ‘but it is my new lantern, and it would be a great loss to me if anything happened to it.’“‘Well, never mind, I will do without it,’ cried little Hans, and he took down his great fur coat, and his warm scarlet cap, and tied a muffler round his throat, and started off.“What a dreadful storm it was!  The night was so black that little Hans could hardly see, and the wind was so strong that he could scarcely stand.  However, he was very courageous, and after he had been walking about three hours, he arrived at the Doctor’s house, and knocked at the door.“‘Who is there?’ cried the Doctor, putting his head out of his bedroom window.“‘Little Hans, Doctor.’“’What do you want, little Hans?’“‘The Miller’s son has fallen from a ladder, and has hurt himself, and the Miller wants you to come at once.’“‘All right!’ said the Doctor; and he ordered his horse, and his big boots, and his lantern, and came downstairs, and rode off in the direction of the Miller’s house, little Hans trudging behind him.“But the storm grew worse and worse, and the rain fell in torrents, and little Hans could not see where he was going, or keep up with the horse.  At last he lost his way, and wandered off on the moor, which was a very dangerous place, as it was full of deep holes, and there poor little Hans was drowned.  His body was found the next day by some goatherds, floating in a great pool of water, and was brought back by them to the cottage.“Everybody went to little Hans’ funeral, as he was so popular, and the Miller was the chief mourner.“‘As I was his best friend,’ said the Miller, ‘it is only fair that I should have the best place’; so he walked at the head of the procession in a long black cloak, and every now and then he wiped his eyes with a big pocket-handkerchief.“‘Little Hans is certainly a great loss to every one,’ said the Blacksmith, when the funeral was over, and they were all seated comfortably in the inn, drinking spiced wine and eating sweet cakes.“‘A great loss to me at any rate,’ answered the Miller; ‘why, I had as good as given him my wheelbarrow, and now I really don’t know what to do with it.  It is very much in my way at home, and it is in such bad repair that I could not get anything for it if I sold it.  I will certainly take care not to give away anything again.  One always suffers for being generous.’”“Well?” said the Water-rat, after a long pause.“Well, that is the end,” said the Linnet.“But what became of the Miller?” asked the Water-rat.“Oh!  I really don’t know,” replied the Linnet; “and I am sure that I don’t care.”“It is quite evident then that you have no sympathy in your nature,” said the Water-rat.“I am afraid you don’t quite see the moral of the story,” remarked the Linnet.“The what?” screamed the Water-rat.“The moral.”“Do you mean to say that the story has a moral?”“Certainly,” said the Linnet.“Well, really,” said the Water-rat, in a very angry manner, “I think you should have told me that before you began.  If you had done so, I certainly would not have listened to you; in fact, I should have said ‘Pooh,’ like the critic.  However, I can say it now”; so he shouted out “Pooh” at the top of his voice, gave a whisk with his tail, and went back into his hole.“And how do you like the Water-rat?” asked the Duck, who came paddling up some minutes afterwards.  “He has a great many good points, but for my own part I have a mother’s feelings, and I can never look at a confirmed bachelor without the tears coming into my eyes.”“I am rather afraid that I have annoyed him,” answered the Linnet.  “The fact is, that I told him a story with a moral.”“Ah! that is always a very dangerous thing to do,” said the Duck.And I quite agree with her.","['morning', 'water-rat', 'head', 'hole', 'bright', 'beady',

746,irish,The Time for Naggeneen's Plan,"Little happened that needs to be told in the next few months, either to the fairies or to the human people. John O’Brien and Peter Sullivan were not long in finding work to do, and they were paid for it, and the two families got on better than they had in Ireland. The O’Briens got on better than the Sullivans. John was a better workman than Peter. Peter could do the work that was set before him in the way that he was told. But John could do better than that. He could see for himself how the work ought to be done, and he saw that if he did it well he might get better work to do. In Ireland, work as he would, he could no more than live, and so he had come to care little what he did or how he did it. But it was different here. The men who employed him saw that he was not a common workman, and soon they gave him better than the common work and more than the common pay.But Peter was a common workman. Then, too, John’s mother knew how to care for the house better than Ellen did, and because of that, too, the O’Briens did better. Every day, just as she used to do in Ireland, Mrs. O’Brien left something to eat and drink outside the house for the Good People. She said that she did not know whether there were any Good People here, but if there were they must be well treated. And when she found that what she left for them was taken, she said that she knew that there were Good People here. Of course she did not know that they were the same ones who had lived near them in Ireland. She put the milk and the water and the bread, or whatever she had for them, on the fire-escape, at the back of the rooms where they lived. And first she always laid down a little piece of carpet to put the dishes on, so that the fairies could come and get the food without touching the iron, for she knew that they could never do that. There was only one thing that did not go well with the O’Briens. Kitty’s health did not come back to her, as they had hoped that it would. She did not need to do any work now, though she would do some, and the rest was good for her, but she was still pale and still weak.Though the Sullivans did not find their fortunes so much improved in the new country as the O’Briens did, yet they felt that they had gained, too, and in one way especially. For the King of the fairies had forbidden Naggeneen to trouble them any more. Naggeneen asked what for at all he had come over all the sea, if he was not to trouble the Sullivans. The King was always ready enough to have Naggeneen’s help, when he thought that his cleverness would be of use; but there were times when he would be obeyed, and this was one of them, so Naggeneen had to do as he was told.The King tried all the things that Naggeneen had told him to do, to make his people learn all the wonderful magic that the human people knew so well. Naggeneen had told him at first that it would all be of no use, and so the King found it. The fairies were sent out to watch the men, to see all that they did, and to learn how to do it. It was all in vain.The King often asked Naggeneen what was the one other way that he had said they might try. Naggeneen would never tell. When the time came to try it, he said, he would tell what it was, but it would be of no more use than the rest that they had done. Naggeneen laughed at all the others when they came home baffled and out of sorts. “You’ll never do the things that men do,” he said, “any more than they’ll ever do the things that you do. And their wonders are more and better than yours.”After a time they ceased to try to learn any more. They began to live much as they had lived in Ireland. They had found a green place where they could dance, near the palace, but it was winter now, and the snow was over everything much of the time. They went to the O’Briens every day for the food that was left outside the window for them, and, for the most part, they spent the rest of the time in the palace. Often Naggeneen played the fiddle or the pipes for them. Then they forgot that it was his fault that they had ever come here, but when he stopped playing they remembered it and hated him again. And Naggeneen laughed at them. He had a strange laugh, without a bit of merriment or good-humor in it. There was something sad in his laugh and something sour, but nothing that it was pleasant to hear.Then the spring began to come. The grass was looking a bit green and the air was warmer. They could dance on the grass now, whenever they liked. They had given up trying to learn the ways of men, and they were beginning to feel as if they had always lived here. Then Naggeneen came one evening and stood before the King and said: “It is the time now to try my plan, if you want to try it, but it’s no good.”“What’s the plan, then, at all?” the King asked.“You know well,” said Naggeneen, “that your people can find out nothing by going out and watching what men do. Now, what you want is to get a human child here, or maybe two of them, and keep them and let them grow up with you here, and then send them out to learn everything that men do, and come back and teach it to your people. Then you’ll learn all these things that men do, and you can do the like.”“Ah, Naggeneen,” said the King, “it’s yourself was always the clever boy. We’ll do that same.”“You will so,” Naggeneen replied, “and no good will it ever do you. I’ve told you before and I tell you again, you’ll never do the things that men do. But it’s crazy you are to try all ways, and I have to be telling you the ways to try. Go on and do it, if it divarts you.”“And where’ll we get the human child at all?” the Queen asked.“Sure then,” said Naggeneen, “and haven’t you heard the news? Why, there’s a baby at the Sullivans’ since this morning, and one at the O’Briens’ since this afternoon. The one at the Sullivans’ is a boy and the one at the O’Briens’ is a girl. Go and get them and leave two of your own people in their places. You know how to do that; it’s nothing new to you.”“Take a child from the O’Briens!” the Queen cried. “From them that’s always been so good to us and always given us the bit and sup, when they scarcely had it themselves? I’d never do such a thing.”“But you’ld be leaving one of your own people in the place of it,” Naggeneen answered, “and they’ld never know the differ. Or if they did, it would be no matter. A woman makes a great hullabaloo when her child looks sick and she thinks it’s dying on her, but she doesn’t care at all after a little. And then, it doesn’t die, and she thinks it’s her own child all the time, and there’s no harm done. And His Majesty here thinks it’s going to do a power of good for all of you. It’s not, but he thinks it is.”“We’ll never take a child from the O’Briens if I can help it,” the Queen said. “From the Sullivans I don’t care, but not from the O’Briens.”“We’ll have to do it,” said the King. “I don’t like to hurt the O’Briens myself, but it’s for the good of us all, and it’s our only chance. These mortals are getting ahead of us that far, and they’ll be doing something next that will exterminate us entirely. We’ll send and get both the children.”The Queen urged again that the O’Briens had always been good to the Good People and must not be harmed, but the King had his mind set on Naggeneen’s plan and he would hear of nothing else. It was settled and it could not be changed. They must have both children. They should live among the fairies till they were old enough to be sent out to learn the ways of men. And they should always come back and teach the fairies the ways of men that they had learned.“And it’s to-night we’d better be doing it, if we’re to do it at all,” said the King. “Now, who’ll be the ones to go and be put in the place of the children?”Nobody seemed to care about going to play the part of a baby with the Sullivans, or even with the O’Briens. Everybody was trying to get out of the King’s sight behind the others. “We’ld have to be lyin’ still all day,” one whispered, “with never a dance to rest ourselves with.”“They might be puttin’ holy water on us,” said another, and all who heard him shivered.“There’ll be all sorts of unpleasantness, anyway,” said a third.“Maybe they’ld find us out,” said a fourth, “and then they’ld be puttin’ all sorts of horrible charms on us to be rid of us.”But the King called one of the women and told her that she must go and stay in the place of the baby at the O’Briens. She whimpered a little, but she knew that what the King said must be done. Then the King looked around him and said, “Where’s Naggeneen got to at all now?”“Here I am to the fore,” said Naggeneen.“You’ll go,” said the King, “and you’ll be put in the place of the boy that’s at the Sullivans.”“I go!” said Naggeneen. “Never a step. Didn’t I tell you of the plan? And that’s enough. Now do it for yourself. I don’t belong to you and you know it. Do your own work.”“I’ll not be disputin’ with you,” said the King. “Whether you belong to me or no, you’re in my palace along with my tribe, and you’ll do what I tell you. It’s tired of you I’ve been this great while, and now I’ve a chance to be rid of you. You’ll go to the Sullivans and you’ll stay there and you’ll grow up like their child. And mind you play your part well and don’t let them know what you are. If you do, they’ll work some charm on you and be rid of you, and then we’ll have to send back the real child, and all your own plan will be lost.”“And how will you carry out my plan without me?” Naggeneen asked. “Don’t I always tell you what to do? You’ll want me a dozen times a day.”“We’ll not want you at all. You do tell us what to do and we do it when we like, and it’s small good ever came of it. And then, if we do want anything of you, we know where to find you, and we’ll easily come to you. It’s been done before. You was left in the place of a young man that was taken away once before, and when the tribe that you was with then wanted to talk to you they came to you, and we can do the same if we like, but I don’t think we shall like.”“That’s just it,” Naggeneen cried; “did you know about that time? This time would be just like it. Do you know how they drove me off? I couldn’t help it then and I couldn’t help it again. There’s times when it seems like there’s a charm on me, and so there is, belike, and I have to do a thing that it’s bad for me to do. Do you know the whole of it, how it was that time?“It was a man that time, as you say, and not a child. Rickard the Rake he was called, I remember, and a fine rake he was. Never a bit of work would he do, but he’ld always be at every fair or wake or the like of that. And so little good there was in him that the fairies in the rath where I was then said: ‘It’s an easy thing it’ll be stealing him away, and serve him right, too, and he’ll be handy for us, he’s so good a dancer.’“I was ordered to be the one to be left in his place, though I knew no good would come of it. And so one night, when he was dancing, we struck him with a dart in the hip, and he fell down where he was. And then, in all the bother and the noise that there was, it was easy to get him away and to leave me in the place of him. So they took me up and put me in bed and nursed me and did all they could think of for me, and me all the time squirming and squealing, like it was dying I was.“They gave me everything I could think of to eat, and that was not so bad, for I never lived better in my life; but it was worn out I was getting, with lying there all the time and playing sick, and never a chance to stir about or get any air or a minute to myself. And the thing I was spoiling for was a tune out of the pipes or the fiddle. Then they brought a fairy-man to look at me, and he said it was a fairy and not Rickard at all that was in it, and I couldn’t be telling you all the bad names he put on me and the things he said about me. And he said: ‘Leave a pair of bagpipes near him, and maybe he’ll play them. You know well Rickard never could play at all, and so if he plays them we’ll know that it’s not Rickard, but a fairy changeling, and then we’ll know what to do.'”Just here I must stop Naggeneen in his story for a minute, to tell you that when people in Ireland speak of a “fairy-man” they do not mean a man fairy. They mean a man who knows all about fairies. The fairy-men know all that the fairies can do, and they know the charms against them and the ways to cure a sickness that the fairies have brought upon anyone, and the ways to keep them from stealing the cream from the milk and the milk from the cow. So the people have great respect for a fairy-man or a fairy-woman, and they often send to one of them for help, when they think that the fairies may have done them a mischief.“They left the pipes beside me,” Naggeneen went on, “and then they went away. Oh, it was then I had the terrible time all out. Oh, may I never long for anything again as I longed to play them pipes! But I knew that they’ld be listening and watching, and if they caught me at it, I’ld have to pay for it, if they could make me. So I kept my hands off them and only groaned and took on as if the dart in my hip was killing me entirely.“Then there was one hot afternoon, and everything was still about the house, and it was the harvest time, and they all had a right to be in the fields at work. And sure I thought it was there they were. And then the wish to play the pipes came on me worse than ever before. And it was then that it was like there was a charm on me, as I was telling you. I had to do what I did. I could no more help doing it than a girl can help dancing with us, when we get her in our ring on May Eve. But first I opened the door a crack and looked out into the kitchen, to see was there anybody there, and there was nobody. But they were all in another room, as I found out after, waiting and listening. There was the fairy-man and a fairy-woman and all the people of the house, and some of the neighbors.“But if I’d seen them all I dunno if I could have done other than I did, the power, whatever it was, was on me that strong. And I took the pipes and played. It was soft I played at first, and then the music got the better of me and I went on more and louder, and I played tunes and tunes. I could play as well then as I can now, and so the other fairies, that had been without me for some time, must have heard me playing, for soon I heard the rustle and the whisper and the patter of their coming, and then they gathered round me, and I had been left there lonely for so long that I kept on playing, to keep them with me.“It was then the fairy-man and the fairy-woman began talking, and I heard every word they said, as no doubt they meant I should. ‘What’ll we do with the little beast at all?’ says she.“‘We’ll do something that’s not too unpleasant at first,’ says he. ‘We’ll take him and hold his head under the water, and see will that drive any of the devilment out of him.’“‘Oh, the thief!’ says she. ‘That’s not the way to treat him at all. Let’s heat the shovel and put him on it and throw him out the window.’“‘Ah, why will you be that cruel?’ says he. ‘Just let me heat the tongs red hot in the fire and then I’ll catch him by the nose with them, and we’ll find out will that make him go home and send poor Rickard back to us.’“‘That’s not enough,’ says she. ‘I’ll go and bring some of the juice of the lussmore that I have, and we’ll make him drink it, and then if he’s a fairy he’ll wish that he was a man, so that he could die, it’ll make that consternation inside him.’“‘We’ll do the both of them things,’ says he, and with that they both started into the kitchen, and all the rest of the people after them. But you may believe that by that time I was not there at all. I’d had enough of their kindness and I didn’t think it was right to wait for any more of it. But I looked in at the window for a last glimpse of them, and one of the women saw me, and she screamed, and then the fairy-man made after me with the tongs, and I had to vanish completely. And you know what would happen then. When they drove me off, of course we had to send back Rickard, and there they found him the next morning, asleep in his bed, as sound as ever he was in his life.“And that was not all. The lesson that he’d had was enough for him, and he left drinking and fighting and swearing, and he helped his old father and his brothers on the farm, and he was another man altogether. And so it’s as I told you. You can never get the better of men, if they know anything, and all you do to hurt them only helps them. And so it will be if you send me to the Sullivans.”“If you’re done talking about it now,” said the King, “you’ll go to the Sullivans and stay in the place of the child that we’re to carry off. It’s not likely they’ll be leaving any pipes or any fiddle about for you to play on, and you can stay there quite comfortable.“Off with him now!” the King cried to a dozen of his men, “and mind you don’t come back without the child. And the same to you,” he said again to others of his men; “take the woman and leave her in the place of the child at the O’Briens’.”The two parties were off, like two little swarms of bees, the one with Naggeneen and the other with the woman. The rest of the fairies waited. The Queen sat on her throne, with her face turned away from the rest and hidden in her hands. The King, with a troubled face, sat looking straight before him, not moving an eye or a hand. The others stood as far off as they could go. Nobody played; nobody danced; nobody laughed or whispered. They waited and watched and listened. Then there was a little murmur and buzz of one of the parties coming back. It was the one that had been to the Sullivans.The King looked up and seemed to look through the fairies without seeing them. “Have you the child with you?” he asked.“We have,” said the leader.“And where’s Naggeneen?” the King asked.“Lying in the bed beside Mrs. Sullivan,” the leader answered, “and squealing like a pig under a gate.”“Give the child something to eat and make him comfortable,” said the King.The Queen turned suddenly around. “Don’t give him anything to eat yet,” she said. “We’ve nothing here but our own food. You couldn’t give him that. What did you bring him here for? Was it not so that you could send him out again, as he grows up, to learn to do the things that men do? And if he touched a bit of our food or our drink, you know he could never leave us.”“That’s the true word,” said the King. “Here! Some of you go to the O’Briens’ and see is there any milk left out of the window. And bring back enough so there’ll be some for the other child, when we get her.”As the fairies set off on this errand there came a sound like the whistling of the wind through the door, and those who had gone to bring the O’Briens’ child were back. They were back in a whirl and a rush and a scramble and a rout. They were all screaming and crying and whimpering and gabbling and gibbering together, and they all fell and sprawled together in a heap before the King. In the midst of them was the woman who had been sent to take the place of the O’Briens’ child.“What for are you here without the child?” the King cried. “And what are you all doing there on the floor, like fish tumbled out of a basket? Get up and tell me what’s wrong with you! Where is the child?”The fairies all choked and gasped and groaned and tried to speak. Then the leader of the party staggered up to his feet and stammered out: “The child is where it was before we went for it. We could not bring it; we could not take it; we could not touch it. You might as well be asking us to bring a lily from the fields of heaven.”“And why could you not take it?” the King asked. “Was the mother holding it so fast in her arms? Could you not make her look the other way while you’ld be taking it? Could you not put some charm on her so that she’ld let it go? Or was she praying all the time, so that you could do nothing with her? Or was she making those signs over it that none of us can stand?”“No, no,” said the leader, so low that they could scarcely hear him; “no, it wasn’t that; the mother was doing none of them things. The mother was dead!”For a minute everybody was still. The Queen started and looked at the leader of the party and leaned toward him. All the others gazed at him too. Then the King said, “And why did you not bring the child?”“I’m after telling you we couldn’t touch the child,” the leader answered. “I went to take it, and all at once I felt burning hot, and like I was all dried up into a cinder, and I think they must have drawn a circle of fire round the child. And then I had that fearful feeling that you have when you’re near a horseshoe nail. There must have been one somewhere about. You couldn’t mistake that feeling—as if needles of ice were going all through and through you. And so I was driven back and could get no nearer to the child.”The woman who had been sent to take the place of the child was standing near the King now, though she could scarcely stand at all, and her face was all wet with tears. “But they made me go nearer to the child than that,” she cried. “These others pushed me close to her, so that I’ld take her place and give the child to them. And I felt burned up like a cinder, too, and then I felt the icy needles, and then worse than that. I felt as if I was all cut across and across and through and through with flaming swords, and torn with red-hot saws. Not the way it is when you divide yourself, so that you can be in two places at once. Anybody can do that, and it hurts no more than cutting a lock of hair, but this was—oh! there’s only one thing could do this. There was a pair of open scissors lying close to the child, and I almost touched them!”She could say no more, and there was no more to be said. “You couldn’t get the child, then,” said the King, “and there’s the end of it. Nobody could, if they did all them things. I dunno how it is,” the King went on, half to himself, “a child lies there with a pair of scissors open near by, and a horseshoe nail close to it—maybe hung around its neck—and a circle drawn around it with a coal of fire, and it never minds it at all. It sleeps and wakes and lies there as peaceful and happy and quiet as if there was nothing at all out of the common about it. I dunno how they can do it. They’re queer people, these mortals. We can’t get the girl. They was too clever for us. But we’ve got the boy, and we’ll do the best we can with him.”","['little', 'happen', 'need', 'told', 'next', 'month', 'either', 'fairy', 'human', 'people', 'john', 'brien', 'peter', 'sullivan',

762,irish,Fin MacCumhail and the Fenians of Erin in the Castle of Fear Dubh,"It was the custom with Fin MacCumhail and the Fenians of Erin, when a stranger from any part of the world came to their castle, not to ask him a question for a year and a day.On a time, a champion came to Fin and his men, and remained with them. He was not at all pleasant or agreeable.At last Fin and his men took counsel together; they were much annoyed because their guest was so dull and morose, never saying a word, always silent.While discussing what kind of man he was, Diarmuid Duivne offered to try him; so one evening when they were eating together, Diarmuid came and snatched from his mouth the hind-quarter of a bullock, which he was picking.Diarmuid pulled at one part of the quarter,—pulled with all his strength, but only took the part that he seized, while the other kept the part he held. All laughed; the stranger laughed too, as heartily as any. It was the first laugh they had heard from him.The strange champion saw all their feats of arms and practised with them, till the year and a day were over. Then he said to Fin and his men:“I have spent a pleasant year in your company; you gave me good treatment, and the least I can do now is to give you a feast at my own castle.”No one had asked what his name was up to that time. Fin now asked his name. He answered: “My name is Fear Dubh, of Alba.”Fin accepted the invitation; and they appointed the day for the feast, which was to be in Erin, since Fear Dubh did not wish to trouble them to go to Alban. He took leave of his host and started for home.When the day for the feast came, Fin and the chief men of the Fenians of Erin set out for the castle of Fear Dubh.They went, a glen at a step, a hill at a leap, and thirty-two miles at a running leap, till they came to the grand castle where the feast was to be given.They went in; everything was ready, seats at the table, and every man’s name at his seat in the same order as at Fin’s castle. Diarmuid, who was always very sportive,—fond of hunting, and paying court to women, was not with them; he had gone to the mountains with his dogs.All sat down, except Conan Maol MacMorna (never a man spoke well of him); no seat was ready for him, for he used to lie on the flat of his back on the floor, at Fin’s castle.When all were seated the door of the castle closed of itself. Fin then asked the man nearest the door, to rise and open it. The man tried to rise; he pulled this way and that, over and hither, but he couldn’t get up. Then the next man tried, and the next, and so on, till the turn came to Fin himself, who tried in vain.Now, whenever Fin and his men were in trouble and great danger it was their custom to raise a cry of distress (a voice of howling), heard all over Erin. Then all men knew that they were in peril of death; for they never raised this cry except in the last extremity.Fin’s son, Fialan, who was three years old and in the cradle, heard the cry, was roused, and jumped up.“Get me a sword!” said he to the nurse. “My father and his men are in distress; I must go to aid them.”“What could you do, poor little child.”Fialan looked around, saw an old rusty sword-blade laid aside for ages. He took it down, gave it a snap; it sprang up so as to hit his arm, and all the rust dropped off; the blade was pure as shining silver.“This will do,” said he; and then he set out towards the place where he heard the cry, going a glen at a step, a hill at a leap, and thirty-two miles at a running leap, till he came to the door of the castle, and cried out.Fin answered from inside, “Is that you, my child?”“It is,” said Fialan.“Why did you come?”“I heard your cry, and how could I stay at home, hearing the cry of my father and the Fenians of Erin!”“Oh, my child, you cannot help us much.”Fialan struck the door powerfully with his sword, but no use. Then, one of the men inside asked Fin to chew his thumb, to know what was keeping them in, and why they were bound.Fin chewed his thumb, from skin to blood, from blood to bone, from bone to marrow, and discovered that Fear Dubh had built the castle by magic, and that he was coming himself with a great force to cut the head off each one of them. (These men from Alba had always a grudge against the champions of Erin.)Said Fin to Fialan: “Do you go now, and stand at the ford near the castle, and meet Fear Dubh.”Fialan went and stood in the middle of the ford. He wasn’t long there when he saw Fear Dubh coming with a great army.“Leave the ford, my child,” said Fear Dubh, who knew him at once. “I have not come to harm your father. I spent a pleasant year at his castle. I’ve only come to show him honor.”“I know why you have come,” answered Fialan. “You’ve come to destroy my father and all his men, and I’ll not leave this ford while I can hold it.”“Leave the ford; I don’t want to harm your father, I want to do him honor. If you don’t let us pass my men will kill you,” said Fear Dubh.“I will not let you pass so long as I’m alive before you,” said Fialan.The men faced him; and if they did Fialan kept his place, and a battle commenced, the like of which was never seen before that day. Fialan went through the army as a hawk through a flock of sparrows on a March morning, till he killed every man except Fear Dubh. Fear Dubh told him again to leave the ford, he didn’t want to harm his father.“Oh!” said Fialan, “I know well what you want.”“If you don’t leave that place I’ll make you leave it!” said Fear Dubh. Then they closed in combat; and such a combat was never seen before between any two warriors. They made springs to rise through the centre of hard gray rocks, cows to cast their calves whether they had them or not. All the horses of the country were racing about and neighing in dread and fear, and all created things were terrified at the sound and clamor of the fight, till the weapons of Fear Dubh went to pieces in the struggle, and Fialan made two halves of his own sword.Now they closed in wrestling. In the first round Fialan put Fear Dubh to his knees in the hard bottom of the river; the second round he put him to his hips, and the third, to his shoulders.“Now,” said he, “I have you,” giving him a stroke of the half of his sword, which cut the head off him.Then Fialan went to the door of the castle and told his father what he had done.Fin chewed his thumb again, and knew what other danger was coming. “My son,” said he to Fialan, “Fear Dubh has a younger brother more powerful than he was; that brother is coming against us now with greater forces than those which you have destroyed.”As soon as Fialan heard these words he hurried to the ford, and waited till the second army came up. He destroyed this army as he had the other, and closed with the second brother in a fight fiercer and more terrible than the first; but at last he thrust him to his armpits in the hard bottom of the river and cut off his head.Then he went to the castle, and told his father what he had done. A third time Fin chewed his thumb, and said: “My son, a third army more to be dreaded than the other two is coming now to destroy us, and at the head of it is the youngest brother of Fear Dubh, the most desperate and powerful of the three.”Again Fialan rushed off to the ford; and, though the work was greater than before, he left not a man of the army alive. Then he closed with the youngest brother of Fear Dubh, and if the first and second battles were terrible this was more terrible by far; but at last he planted the youngest brother up to his armpits in the hard bottom of the river, and swept the head off him.Now, after the heat and struggle of combat Fialan was in such a rage that he lost his mind from fury, not having any one to fight against; and if the whole world had been there before him he would have gone through it and conquered it all.But having no one to face him he rushed along the river-bank, tearing the flesh from his own body. Never had such madness been seen in any created being before that day.Diarmuid came now and knocked at the door of the castle, having the dog Bran with him, and asked Fin what had caused him to raise the cry of distress.“Oh, Diarmuid,” said Fin, “we are all fastened in here to be killed. Fialan has destroyed three armies, and Fear Dubh with his two brothers. He is raging now along the bank of the river; you must not go near him, for he would tear you limb from limb. At this moment he wouldn’t spare me, his own father; but after a while he will cease from raging and die down; then you can go. The mother of Fear Dubh is coming, and will soon be at the ford. She is more violent, more venomous, more to be dreaded, a greater warrior than her sons. The chief weapon she has are the nails on her fingers; each nail is seven perches long, of the hardest steel on earth. She is coming in the air at this moment with the speed of a hawk, and she has a kŭŕan (a small vessel), with liquor in it, which has such power that if she puts three drops of it on the mouths of her sons they will rise up as well as ever; and if she brings them to life there is nothing to save us.“Go to the ford; she will be hovering over the corpses of the three armies to know can she find her sons, and as soon as she sees them she will dart down and give them the liquor. You must rise with a mighty bound upon her, dash the kŭŕan out of her hand and spill the liquor.“If you can kill her save her blood, for nothing in the world can free us from this place and open the door of the castle but the blood of the old hag. I’m in dread you’ll not succeed, for she is far more terrible than all her sons together. Go now; Fialan is dying away, and the old woman is coming; make no delay.”Diarmuid hurried to the ford, stood watching a while; then he saw high in the air something no larger than a hawk. As it came nearer and nearer he saw it was the old woman. She hovered high in the air over the ford. At last she saw her sons, and was swooping down, when Diarmuid rose with a bound into the air and struck the vial a league out of her hand.The old hag gave a shriek that was heard to the eastern world, and screamed: “Who has dared to interfere with me or my sons?”“I,” answered Diarmuid; “and you’ll not go further till I do to you what has been done to your sons.”The fight began; and if there ever was a fight, before or since, it could not be more terrible than this one; but great as was the power of Diarmuid he never could have conquered but for Bran the dog.The old woman with her nails stripped the skin and flesh from Diarmuid almost to the vitals. But Bran tore the skin and flesh off the old woman’s back from her head to her heels.From the dint of blood-loss and fighting, Diarmuid was growing faint. Despair came on him, and he was on the point of giving way, when a little robin flew near to him, and sitting on a bush, spoke, saying:“Oh, Diarmuid, take strength; rise and sweep the head off the old hag, or Fin and the Fenians of Erin are no more.”Diarmuid took courage, and with his last strength made one great effort, swept the head off the old hag and caught her blood in a vessel. He rubbed some on his own wounds,—they were cured; then he cured Bran.Straightway he took the blood to the castle, rubbed drops of it on the door, which opened, and he went in.All laughed with joy at the rescue. He freed Fin and his men by rubbing the blood on the chairs; but when he came as far as Conan Maol the blood gave out.All were going away. “Why should you leave me here after you;” cried Conan Maol, “I would rather die at once than stay here for a lingering death. Why don’t you, Oscar, and you, Gol MacMorna, come and tear me out of this place; anyhow you’ll be able to drag the arms out of me and kill me at once; better that than leave me to die alone.”Oscar and Gol took each a hand, braced their feet against his feet, put forth all their strength and brought him standing; but if they did, he left all the skin and much of the flesh from the back of his head to his heels on the floor behind him. He was covered with blood, and by all accounts was in a terrible condition, bleeding and wounded.Now there were sheep grazing near the castle. The Fenians ran out, killed and skinned the largest and best of the flock, and clapped the fresh skin on Conan’s back; and such was the healing power in the sheep, and the wound very fresh, that Conan’s back healed, and he marched home with the rest of the men, and soon got well; and if he did, they sheared off his back wool enough every year to make a pair of stockings for each one of the Fenians of Erin, and for Fin himself.And that was a great thing to do and useful, for wool was scarce in Erin in those days. Fin and his men lived pleasantly and joyously for some time; and if they didn’t, may we.","['custom', 'maccumhail', 'fenians', 'erin', 'stranger', 'part', 'world', 'come', 'castle', 'question',

806,irish,The Stars in the Water,"This is to be another sort of chapter altogether. I am going to tell you now what happened. The eighteen years are gone now and we have come to the time when there is something to tell.When those eighteen years began, you know, Kathleen and Terence were not much more than born. So, if you have got as far as addition and can add eighteen to nothing and find that it makes eighteen, you will see that by this time they were about eighteen years old. John O’Brien and his mother and Kathleen did not live on the east side of Central Park any more. John had got on better and better with the work that he was doing. After a while, instead of having to do work of common kinds any more, he had been put in charge of other men who were doing it. After another while he learned so much about the work and how it was done and how it ought to be done, that he was made one of the partners in the company that did it. So he got a good deal more money and he was able to take his mother and Kathleen out of the little tenement where she was born, and to live in a better place. Then he had a house of his own, over on the west side of the Park, and it was there that Kathleen lived when she was eighteen years old.Peter had not got along so well. John himself employed him, but Peter knew enough to go only just so far, and there he stuck. He lived in a little better place than he did at first, but he could never make his way like John. And then Terence, as he grew up, made a good deal of trouble. He never would learn anything useful and he never would do anything useful. He never helped his father at all, and always his father had to help him. If there was any fight or any accident or anything troublesome or wrong within a mile, Terence was always in the midst of it. He was constantly getting his head and his ribs broken, and Peter was always having to pay for other people’s things that he had broken, from their heads to their windows.Ellen’s excuse for him, that he was never well and had never been quite himself since he was born, was pretty well worn out. For, people said, he had always been exactly the same ever since he was born, and if that same was not himself, who was it? But Ellen kept saying it none the less. Many a time Mrs. O’Brien tried to make her believe that the boy was a changeling, and not her child at all, and many a time she begged Ellen to let her only try a charm to see if he was, but Ellen never would hear of it. She always said what she had said at first, that nobody knew him but her. She saw him better when she dreamed about him, for then she saw him as he really was, without all the harm that had been done to him by all the sickness that had been on him one time and another.You might suppose that anybody who could play the fiddle as well as Terence need not have any trouble in making his own living. He might have found a place in a theatre, like the man whose fiddle he had played on first. He might have taught others to play. Or he might have played all by himself, and hundreds of people would have paid to hear him. But he would play only when he chose, and he would never do anything useful with his fiddle. And everybody said he played so wonderfully—everybody except Kathleen.And this brings us back to Kathleen. Terence heard before he was many years old something about the plan that Peter and John had made, that he and Kathleen should be married when they grew up, if they both liked the plan. He seemed to forget all about this last part, “if they both liked the plan.” He liked the plan himself and he seemed to think that that was enough. He had talked about it to Kathleen many times, before they were both eighteen years old, and it troubled Kathleen so that she tried never to see Terence when she could possibly help it. She had always disliked him, though she had always tried not to show it; but as they got a little older and she found that there was no other way to keep away from him at all, she had to tell him so.But do you suppose that made any difference with Terence? Well, it did make a difference with him, but he did not let anybody see that it did. When Kathleen told him for the first time that she did not like him at all, he went away by himself. He went straight to the hill that is in the north end of the Park, and there he threw himself down on his face on the grass. For hours he lay there, trembling and crying, and beating the ground with his feet and his fists. And it would take another book as large as this to tell all that he was saying to himself or to the grass, or to something under the grass—how can I tell? And you would not want to read the book. It is not likely that you will ever see anybody in such a rage as he was in. But at the end of it he stood up and looked just as he usually did, and went straight to the O’Briens’ and stayed all the evening and kept as near Kathleen as he could, and stared at her all the time. And he talked to her then and afterward, just as if she had told him that she liked him better than anybody else that she knew.So Kathleen had to go to her grandmother, as she always did when she was in any trouble, and tell her all about it. And her grandmother told her that she and Terence were both a good deal too young to think of anything of the sort, and that she would do all that she could to help her. But she could not do much. She told John about it, and he said that he should be sorry if the plan that he and Peter had made could not be carried out, but he would forbid it himself, as long as Terence was so lazy and so worthless and so bad as he was now. When he got a little older, he hoped that everything would be better, and there was no hurry about anything.And though Terence made her so much trouble, Kathleen had many other things to think about. She went to school and learned a great deal, and her grandmother taught her a great deal more. Her grandmother told her stories still, and, though she was nearly eighteen and felt that she was getting so dreadfully old, she still liked stories. Then she had a good many friends, and she spent much of her time with them. She visited Ellen often, too, going to see her at times when she thought that Terence would not be at home. Ellen and Peter still lived on the east side of the Park, and some of her friends lived there, too, so that Kathleen often walked through the north end of the Park, near that hill that I have told you about so many times before.Kathleen was fond of this part of the Park, as everybody is who knows it. But especially she was fond of one little spot that nobody else seemed to notice much. So Kathleen got a feeling that this one place belonged to her, and she was all the more fond of it because of that. It was a tiny little basin of water, near the path, but up a grassy bank. On the side toward the path it was all open, but on the other side there were rocks, and out of a little cleft in the rocks ran a bit of a stream of water that fed the little basin. Then, around the rocks and over them there was more grass, and the hill rose at both sides and above. On the edge of the hill, right over the basin, was a pine-tree, and around it were other trees. Their branches came together over the water and almost shut out the sky from it, but not quite.Every time that Kathleen passed it, she went up the bank and looked into the still water. She had a feeling that if she ever went by and did not do this the water would miss her and would feel hurt. When she did this by daylight and in summer, if she stood up and looked into the water, she could see a patch of branches and green leaves and blue sky through them, about as big as the basin itself, and that was scarcely larger than a fair-sized tub. But if she stooped down close to the water and looked into it, she saw that there was a great deal of sky under it, below the trees, which grew upside down. There was almost as much sky under the water as she could see above it, and she believed that there would prove to be quite as much if she could only get her head where she could see it.She used to look in at night sometimes, too, and try to see if there were any stars in that sky; but in the summer she never could see any, because the leaves on the trees were so thick that they almost hid the sky, and they seemed to be thicker and to hide the sky more by night than they did by day. In the winter it was different. Then there were no leaves, but only branches and twigs, which covered the sky like lace work, and through these Kathleen sometimes thought that she could see a star or two in the water, but she was seldom quite sure. Yet she never passed the place without looking in it, to see the green leaves and the blue sky or the black leaves and the almost black sky, or the stars, if she could find any.On a certain day—the last day of April it was—there was a good deal of excitement in the fairy palace under the hill. The reason of it was that a new fairy had come to live there. Perhaps you never heard of a baby fairy. I have read a good many stories about fairies that said nothing about any such thing. Now, you needn’t try to be so bright about it and say that of course there must be baby fairies, or there could not be any grown-up fairies. That isn’t so at all. Fairies are not like men about growing old and dying and other fairies taking their places. I have heard of a fairy funeral, but I can’t imagine how it happened, and I think that the story about it must have been a mistake. If you have read this book as far as here, you know that most fairies are thousands of years old, and you know, too—for Naggeneen has told you—what is likely to become of them in the end. Still, there is no sort of doubt that now and then a new fairy is born, and there was one born on this day. He was the son of the King and the Queen, and you can guess well enough that a fairy prince is a person of some consequence.“What will we do at all for a nurse for the baby?” said the Queen.“What will we do at all?” said the King.“It never would do for me to have the care of him at the first,” said the Queen.“Never a bit,” said the King; “it would ruin him.”“How would it ruin him?” said the Queen.“Never a know I know, no more nor you,” said the King, “but you know as well as I it would ruin him.”“Why can’t I care for my own child?” said the Queen, “the same as a human mother does?”“I dunno,” said the King, “only we know you can’t. We’ve never dared try, to see what would happen. He must have a human nurse. Maybe it’s something to do with them things Naggeneen was always talking about our having no souls—”“Don’t be talking about Naggeneen,” said the Queen, “and me not well at all.” Then she was silent for a little while and then she went on talking about Naggeneen herself. “Are you sorry he left us?”“Who?” said the King.“Naggeneen,” said the Queen.“I’m not sorry,” said the King. “We’ve more peace without him. Though he was clever and he often told us the right thing to do and he might tell us the right thing to do now.”“Did he tell us the right thing to do when he told us to bring Terence here to learn the ways of men and to teach them to us?”“Sure Terence is a good boy,” said the King, “and he plays the fiddle as well as Naggeneen himself, so we don’t miss Naggeneen for the only thing that he was good for. And Terence is easier to have about other ways.”“But has he ever learned the ways of men and taught them to us?” the Queen asked.The King was getting annoyed. “He has learned them, I think,” he said, “but he has never taught them to us. And you know Naggeneen himself said the plan would be no use.”“He did,” said the Queen; “only you would try it. And just so all this talk is no use. What will we do for a nurse for the baby?”“We’ll find one some way,” the King answered. “Was you thinking of anyone in particular?”“I was not thinking of anyone in particular.”“How would Kathleen O’Brien do, do you think?” the King asked.“I don’t want to be troubling the O’Briens,” the Queen said, “and they always so kind to us.”“It would not be troubling them much; we’ld only keep her a little while and they’ld hardly miss her.”“If she was once here,” said the Queen, “some one of your men would want to keep her, and it would break the heart of her grandmother. So it would her father’s, too, but I’m not thinking so much of him.”“We’ll not keep her,” said the King, “only as long as the child needs her.”“You say that now,” said the Queen; “it would be different if she was once here—I’ld like to have her as well as anyone I know.”“We could find no one else so good,” said the King. “It’s May Eve, you mind. There’s no time when we have more power, and few when we have so much. We’ll all be dancing to-night, and Kathleen often passes along just about dark. It’s likely we could get her to dance with us, and then we’ld be sure enough of her. If that fails, there’s other ways. Our power lasts till sunrise.”“And you think we’ld not be keeping her long?” said the Queen.“We’ld have her home almost before she was missed,” the King answered.“I wouldn’t mind if you tried,” said the Queen.Kathleen had been to visit Ellen. She was on her way home through the Park, and she had meant to get there before dark, but it was a little later than she had thought, and she saw the red in the sky before her getting darker and duller every minute. As she walked along she saw two other girls of about her own age, whom she knew, in front of her. She overtook them and the three walked on together, though the others could scarcely keep up, Kathleen hurried so.When they were nearly through the Park they came to the little basin where the water ran down out of the rock. Though she wanted to get home so quickly, she could not pass this place without going up the bank and looking into the water, because she felt so sure that if she did not the water would miss her and feel hurt. She ran up the bank and looked into the still little pool. The other girls went on, and she heard one of them call after her: “Thought you were in a hurry!”Kathleen did not mind them, but only looked into the water, which was almost black, it was getting so dark all around. She had not seen the water look so dark in a long time. She looked up over her head and she saw that it was because the little new leaves had begun to come out on the trees and were beginning to hide the sky. She saw one or two of the brightest stars, that had already come out in the sky, and she looked back into the water and tried to see them there, but she could not find them. There was nothing but the little, still, black pool.She went back to the path and ran on after the other girls. She saw them walking on slowly, only a little way ahead of her. Just as she had nearly come up with them she stood still to look at a wonderful sight. She just thought dimly that it was strange that the other girls were not watching it, too, but the sight itself excited her so that she had not much time to think of that. On the grass, close beside the path, there were ever so many boys and girls—at least she thought at first that they were boys and girls—dancing. The grass in that place sloped upward from the path, and the ground was a little hollowed, in a sort of shell shape. All around the place, except where the path was, trees and bushes hung over the grass. The buds were just opening here, too, and the air was full of the smell of the new spring grass and leaves, which always grows stronger in the evening.Kathleen stood gazing at the boys and girls dancing. There were so many of them that she could not count them. She thought that they seemed to be a little younger and smaller than herself. The boys all wore green jackets and red caps. When she looked at them more closely she could not tell whether they were boys at all or not. They looked more like old men. And she could scarcely believe that either, because they danced so fast and seemed so lively. Her father could not dance like that, she was sure, and he was not an old man.But she had no doubt that the girls were girls. Usually she could not tell a pretty girl from an ugly one, any more than any other girl can, but she knew that these were pretty. Anybody would. They had long, golden hair that hung all loose and free and came down to their knees, when the little wind did not blow it away in some other direction. They had deep, soft eyes. They were dressed in long, white gowns, so white that they shone, now like a sheet of pale light and now with a hundred little sparkles, as the water of the sea does sometimes, when it is broken into foam by the prow of a ship. All the men carried lanterns and all the girls had something that looked like long flower-stems, only there were tiny lights on the ends of them, instead of flowers. These and the lanterns did not seem to trouble them at all in dancing, and if Kathleen had seen the lights and had not seen the dancers, she would have thought that they were a swarm of fireflies.She had scarcely stood there for a minute before one of the men came up to her and asked her to dance with him. Kathleen’s first thought was that she ought to be afraid, and her second thought was that she was not afraid a bit. She liked dancing and she had just been wishing that she could dance with these boys and girls. Then she wondered if it was quite right. Then she could not see what there could be wrong about it. Then she let the little man take her hand and she stepped off the path upon the grass and began to dance. She heard the other girls calling to her again, farther up the path. She called back to them: “I am coming in a minute! Wait for me!” And then she went on dancing.When she had been only looking on, the dancing had seemed to Kathleen to be quite wonderful, but now she found that she could do it all nearly as well as the little boys and girls. She thought that it might be because the little old man was a better partner for dancing than she had ever had before. They danced around by themselves, moving in and out among the others, no matter how close together they were, and always finding their way, now in the midst of the whole company and now out beyond the very edge of it, and then suddenly all the dancers would join hands and whirl about in a great circle, so fast that Kathleen could not tell whether her feet were touching the ground at all.It seemed to her that she had never done anything so delightful before. She did not think of going on with the other girls any more. She did not think of getting home early, or of anything but the dancing. She could not tell at all how long she had been dancing, but it was all dark, except for the little lanterns and the little lights on the flower-stems, and the stars were all out in the sky. And then somebody said: “It is time to go.”The man who had been dancing with Kathleen whispered to her: “You are to go with us.”And Kathleen thought of nothing but of going with the queer little old men and the beautiful little girls. They all left the shell-shaped grass-plot and moved along together—Kathleen could scarcely tell even now whether her feet were on the ground or not—over the grass, till they came to a little pool of water—Kathleen’s own little pool.She looked down into it, and there was no doubt about the stars now. There were hundreds of them down under the water, shining up through it from as far below, it seemed, as the stars in the sky were up above. The dancers who came to it first stepped on the surface of the pool, and it bore them up as if it had been a floor of glass. Then Kathleen saw that the rocks behind the pool were not as she had ever seen them before. There was an opening straight into the hill, and when she came nearer still she saw that the water was no longer a little pool. It was more like a long, narrow lake, and it covered the bottom of the opening that led into the hill. All the people were going in, walking along the path of water as easily as if it had been a path of ice.Again it seemed to Kathleen that she ought to be afraid, and again it seemed to her, still more clearly, that she was not afraid. When she came to the water she put her foot upon it and walked along it as easily as the others were doing. She thought that she would remember that this water could be walked on, and would try it the next day. She had never thought of trying it before.But now she and the others were moving along the path into the hill. It was still dark, except for the lights that they carried and the stars that shone up through the water. And these were not the reflection of any stars in the sky, for there was no sky to be seen over them now—only rocks. Then there was a pale violet light shining on the walls of the passage ahead of them. Then, as Kathleen looked down at the water again, to see if she were really walking on it, she saw that there were no more stars, but the water was of a faint, shining yellow, and in a moment she was not walking on water any more, but on a floor, that seemed to her to be all of gold.She could do nothing now but stand still and look around at the wonderful sight. All around her were walls of silver, so bright that they reflected everything in the great hall, and she could not tell at all how large it was. But she made out that in the middle was a great dome, held up by the most wonderful gleaming columns of gold and silver, first a column of gold and then a column of silver, and these she saw again and again in the walls all about. She could not see the top of the dome from where she stood, it was so high, but all around the sides of it she saw great diamonds and rubies and emeralds, some of them as big as her head, that poured down soft white and red and green lights, and these she saw, too, shining up, a little dimmer, from the gold of the floor, which was almost as good a mirror as the walls.The sides of the dome, in which the jewels were set, were all of bands and lines and ribbons of gold and silver, wonderfully woven together into shapes and patterns which she could not follow or trace out with her eyes, because they seemed to be always slowly moving—turning and twisting and winding and wreathing about, never for a moment the same, but always new and always beautiful. And when this was reflected in the golden floor it was like the wavering shapes in water that is almost still, but yet has little waves that dance and break up every reflection that is seen in it.And still, although she saw no lamps except the great white and red and green gems, there came from somewhere—perhaps from the top of the dome, she thought—that violet light that she had seen first on the walls of the passage, and it filled the whole hall, like the glow of a glorious sunset that never faded. And all this was inside a hill that Kathleen had known all the years of her life, and she had never seen anything wonderful about it.While Kathleen is wondering at the fairy palace I will explain to you the subject which you have been wondering about. If you only knew more we could get on with the story so much faster. It is most annoying. And you have been brought up so well too! I don’t see that it is anybody’s fault but your own. You have been wondering all along how it was that the fairies seemed to Kathleen to be, as I said, only a little smaller than herself, when you have always heard that fairies were so very little.Well, to think of your not understanding that! I am bound to say that when I was of your age I was just as ignorant about it as you are now, but then, children now have a good many more advantages than they had in my day. Considering how few advantages we had, it is a great credit to people of my age that we know anything at all, and, considering how many of them you have, it is a disgrace to you that you do not know everything.When I was a child I used to read about fairies, and the book would say that they were six inches tall, or that they were about as big as a man’s thumb, or it would tell about their sitting in flowers. And then I would look at the pictures and they would appear to be as high as a man’s knees, or even higher. And I could not understand it. But I made up my mind to find out about it. That is what you must do, when there is anything that you don’t understand. There are very few things that you can’t do, if you make up your mind to them, except things that are too hard for you. I hate to have morals getting into a story as much as you do, but that is such a good one that it might as well go in.Now I will tell you. Fairies can be of any size they like, and you never can tell what size they are going to be, from one minute to another. They can be giants, if they like. And as soon as they had Kathleen with them they could make her of any size they liked too. So as long as she was among them they could keep her and themselves just the same size, or as near to it as they liked.But when fairies are not taking the trouble to be of any particular size—when they are letting themselves alone, as you might say—then they are about six inches tall. And I think that is a very good size to be. It would be better if you were of that size. You wouldn’t eat so much and you wouldn’t be so much in the way, and you would be much better-looking. Just think: if your face were only three-quarters of an inch long, all those features of it that are so disagreeable wouldn’t show so plainly. You might even look rather pretty. You wouldn’t need to be so, but you might look so.And it would be so much easier to know where you were, if you were of that size, that it would save your mother a good deal of trouble. All she would have to do would be to put you on the mantelpiece, and then you could not get off without breaking your necks—and that would be such an advantage. I don’t mean that it would be an advantage to break your necks, because then who would read this book, and why should I take all this trouble to write it? I mean, it would be an advantage that you could not get off. Well, now you see how much better off you would be if you were only six inches tall, and now you understand about the fairies.While Kathleen was still wondering at the place that she was in, a man whom she had not seen before came up to her. He wore a crown, and she guessed at once that he was some sort of king. It did not surprise her to see a man with a crown. A man with a church steeple on his head would not have surprised her, by this time. “Come with me,” he said; “you’re wanted at once.”Kathleen followed him to the opposite side of the hall and through a door, into another room. It was much smaller than the hall, but it was just as beautiful, in its own way. There was a woman in this room—another of the beautiful girls, Kathleen would have said—lying on a gold couch. Her hair was hanging down over the pillow on which her head lay, so that Kathleen could scarcely tell which was the hair and which was the gold of the couch. There was a crown lying on a little table beside her, and so Kathleen guessed that she was the Queen. “Kathleen,” said the Queen, “do you know why they have brought you here?”“No, Your Majesty,” said Kathleen. She was not a bit frightened, any more than she had been all along, and she knew that that was the way to speak to a queen, just as well as if she had never spoken to anybody else in her life.“They brought you here, then,” said the Queen, “to take care of my baby; but he’ll not need you long, and then you can be going back home.”“I’m afraid,” Kathleen said, “that I don’t know how to take care of a baby very well. I might do something wrong with it. You see my mother died when I was born, and so I was the only baby that there ever was at our house, and I have hardly ever had anything to do with a real live baby.”“You’ve had something to do with them that was not alive, haven’t you?” the Queen asked.Kathleen smiled a little at that. “There were fifteen of them, I think,” she said.“Well, you’ll be having no more trouble with this one,” the Queen said, “than with any of those fifteen. Only do as you’re told. I can’t take care of it myself, because it’s the law that it must have a nurse that’s a mort—I mean it must have a nurse from outside this place. There’s the baby in the cradle there. Try can you make him go to sleep.”Kathleen went to the cradle and looked at the baby. It was wide awake and it stared at her like a little owl. Except for that, it looked like any other baby. The way that the baby stared at her came nearer to making Kathleen afraid than anything that she had seen yet. But she took him out of the cradle, sat down on a low seat that she found, began to rock him gently, and sang an old song that her grandmother used to sing to her and that she had sung to her own fifteen babies many a time.It was scarcely an instant before the baby was asleep. She put him back into the cradle and then turned to the Queen and said: “Shall I do anything more?”“Not now,” said the King; “come now and have something to eat and drink with us.”The Queen started at this and cried: “No, no!” but Kathleen did not know what she meant. She knew that she was very hungry, and she followed the King out of the room, back into the hall. Tables had been brought into the hall now, and they were all covered with things to eat that looked very good, and the men and women were sitting at the tables, eating and drinking and talking and laughing. They all stood up as the King came in, and waited till he had taken his place at the head of the table, and then they all sat down again, and the eating and drinking and talking and laughing went on.One of the men led Kathleen to a seat and put something to eat and drink before her. She did not know what it was, but it looked good. She was just going to taste it, when somebody touched her on the shoulder and somebody said: “Don’t eat that; don’t taste a bit of it.”She looked around and saw a boy—perhaps she would have said a young man—standing behind her. He was very different from all the other men. He did not look old, as they did. She thought that he was of about her own age, and he was taller than she, while all the others were shorter. “Don’t eat anything or drink anything that they give you,” he said again. “I will give you something to eat.”He sat down beside her and put a little package on the table before them. He opened it and took out some bread and meat, some strawberries, a little flask full of cream, and a larger one full of water. He gave Kathleen a part of all these and kept a part for himself. “I am not sure,” Kathleen said, “that I ought to let you talk to me, because, you see, I don’t know who you are.”She had let several people talk to her that evening, without knowing who they were, but this boy seemed to be somehow altogether different.“My name is Terence,” he said. “Now I know you are going to ask ‘Terence what?’ It’s Terence nothing; I have no name at all except Terence.”“I know a boy named Terence,” Kathleen said, “and I don’t like him a bit.”“I hope that won’t make any difference about your liking me,” said the boy.“Oh, not at all,” said Kathleen. “It isn’t his name that I don’t like; it’s himself. He is only just as old as I am, and he looks—” Kathleen stopped, surprised at herself, for she had not thought of it before. “He looks a little like these men here, who all seem to be so old; and, besides, he isn’t nice at all.”“Then let’s not talk about him,” said the boy. “Will you tell me what your name is?”“Oh, yes; didn’t I tell you? My name is Kathleen O’Brien.”“And must I call you Kathleen or Miss O’Brien? You see you will have to call me by my first name, because it is the only one I have, and so I think you ought to let me call you by your first name.”“But if you have only one name,” Kathleen said, “it is your last name just as much as it is your first, so perhaps you ought to call me by my last one.”“Oh, no,” Terence answered; “you see my name ought to be a first name, only I haven’t any last one, so I think I ought to call you by your first one.”Kathleen did not say that he might, but he afterward did. She thought that it would be better to change the subject. “It’s just as if we were at a picnic and had brought our own luncheon, isn’t it?” she said. “And all these other people are eating just as if they were at home. Why don’t we do the same way they do?”“Because,” Terence said, “we are not like them. We mustn’t talk about it aloud. You see they are the Good People, and we are not. I don’t know what I am at all, but you are like the people outside. I knew that as soon as I saw you, and I saw that they were going to let you eat their food. I almost wish I had let you do it now—no, I don’t wish so, either. It would be mean to let you, and I don’t want you to, anyway. You did come from outside, didn’t you? Well, then, you must not eat or drink the least bit of anything while you are here, except what I bring you. All that I bring you is from outside. If you eat a crumb or drink a drop of anything that they have here, you can never get out again.”“But they all get out,” said Kathleen. “They were all outside when I saw them first.”“Oh, yes,” Terence answered, “they are different. They can go out and come in whenever they like; but if anybody from outside eats anything here, he can never go out again. It is that way with me, too, for I am different from the Good People, though I don’t know whether I came from outside or not.”“You don’t know whether you came from outside or not?”“No. I came here when I was a little baby. I have often asked them how I came here, but they never would tell me. I have lived here ever since I can remember. Have you a father and a mother?”“My mother is dead,” Kathleen answered; “I have a father.”“Yes,” said Terence, as if he were trying to work out a puzzle. “Nearly all the people outside seem to have fathers and mothers. I never had either. I have always lived here, but nobody here is my father or my mother, and I don’t know how I came here. I have been here so long, and yet it seems so strange to me. This is my only home, and yet I never feel at home in it. I always feel as if I belonged somewhere else. I see the people outside and I feel as if I belonged with them more than here, yet I have never been outside this place one single night.”“You go out often in the daytime, then?” Kathleen asked.“Oh, yes; I go out every day, almost, and I go to school. Have you been to school?”“Why, of course,” Kathleen answered; “doesn’t everybody have to go to school?”“These people here never go to school,” Terence said. “I am the only one who goes, and then I have to try to teach them what I have learned. Do you go home from school and try to teach your father what you have learned?”“Why, no, indeed,” said Kathleen; “what a funny idea!”“Sometimes it seems funny to me too,” Terence said, “but you see I can’t tell whether it is funny or not, because I know so little about the people outside. I don’t like to ask them, because they would think it was so strange that I didn’t know; but it is different with you. You have come in here, and I can ask you things that I wouldn’t ask of people outside.”“If they want to know things,” said Kathleen, “why don’t they go to school themselves?”“I don’t know that, either,” said Terence, “but they seem to expect me to go to school for all of them. I think that is what I am here for. Before I was old enough to go to school at all they used to bring me things to eat from outside, because, you know, if I ate anything of theirs I never could go out. Then as soon as I was old enough to go to school, they sent me, and I came back every night, and they gave me money to buy all my own food outside, and I have done that ever since, and I have never eaten a bit of the Good People’s food.”“And don’t you like to stay here?” Kathleen asked. “It seems to me a very beautiful place.”“No,” said Terence; “they are very kind to me, but I think that I should like to live outside better, and I hope that I shall some time. And then, you see, if I ate anything here I could not go out to go to school, and so I could not teach them. And it is all so strange. It almost makes me cry, it is such a bother sometimes, and then they are so sorry about it themselves and I am so sorry for them, and it almost makes me laugh sometimes, because they can never learn anything. You will see. I think it is time now.”Some of the men were taking away the tables. “It is time for the lesson,” the King called out. Some of the other men brought in a big blackboard and set it up. Everybody stopped talking and laughing and stood near the blackboard. Terence made some lines and some letters on the board, with a piece of chalk.“I shall have to try again,” said Terence, “to prove to you the same thing that I tried to prove to you last night. But I’ll try a different way, and maybe you’ll see it better. Now mind, what I am to prove is this: if any triangle has two sides equal, the angles opposite those sides are also equal.”“And what difference does it make if they’re equal or not?” said one of the men who stood near Kathleen.“Be still there,” the King said; “do we want to make telephones or do we not? And sure we can’t make telephones without geometry. Hasn’t Terence told you that?”Terence went on: “Let ABC be any triangle in which the sides AB and AC are equal.”“How can it be any triangle, when it’s only one triangle?” said another of the men.“Keep your silly head shut,” said the King. “Terence didn’t say it was any triangle; he said let it be. Now will you let that triangle be, or will I come over there and make you let it be?”The man said nothing more and Terence went on: “Now, consider this triangle as two triangles, BAC and CAB.”“How can it be two triangles,” another of the men said, “when it’s only one triangle?”“Will you be still there?” the King said. “Terence doesn’t say it’s two triangles; he says you’re to consider it. Will you consider that triangle two triangles, or will I come over there and make you consider it two triangles?”“I’ll consider it seven triangles, if you like, Your Majesty,” the man answered, “but I dunno what good it’ll do me.”“Then consider it,” said the King, “and don’t talk about it. Go on, Terence.”“Now, you see that since the sides AB and AC in each triangle are equal, AB and AC in the first are respectively equal to AC and AB in the second, and the angles between these sides are equal. So the two triangles are equal, by previous proposition. And so the angles of one are equal to the angles of the other, where they are opposite the equal sides; that is, the angle ABC is equal to the angle ACB, being opposite the equal sides AC and AB, by the same previous proposition, and that is what I was to prove.”The King looked at the men with triumph in his eye. “There, you blackguards,” he said, “do you understand it at all, now that Terence has made it clear to you?”One by one the men and women began slowly to shake their heads. Not one of them understood it. “Well, Terence,” said the King, shaking his own head, “I dunno how it is; nobody could be asking you to make it any clearer than you have, and yet I’m obliged to say there’s never a bit of it I understand myself. Maybe to-morrow night you’ll be able to make us see it clearer.”Terence had come back to where Kathleen was. “Isn’t it funny,” he said, “and yet isn’t it a pity? I try to teach them as well as I can, but they never can understand at all.”“And do you mean to say,” said Kathleen, “that you haven’t got any farther in geometry than that? Why, that’s only the fifth proposition of the first book.”“Of course I’ve got farther than that,” Terence answered, “but they haven’t, and they never will. I have been trying to teach them that proposition—oh, I don’t know how long—and they never will learn it in the world. They want to learn to build railways and bridges and all sorts of things, but how can anybody even get ready to build a railway or a bridge till he’s got over this bridge and the rest of the geometry? I don’t know whether I can ever learn it all myself, but I’m going to the School of Engineering up at the University, next spring, to learn chemistry, and qualitative analysis, and calculus, and analytical mechanics, and graphical statics, and metallurgy, and thermodynamics, and hydraulics, and a lot of other things. But these people here will still be at work on this same triangle years after I am dead, if they have anybody to teach them.”“Now, Terence, my boy,” said the King, “there’s one thing you can do for us we can understand. Give us a tune out of the fiddle.”Kathleen was startled to hear this boy named Terence asked to play on the fiddle, just as if he had been the other Terence whom she knew. She wondered if he played like the other Terence. She scarcely dared wait to hear, and she felt as if she should like to run away, only she did not know where to run.But she did not think any more about running after Terence began to play. This was different. And yet in one way it was the same. For the music that Terence was playing was just the music that the other Terence often played and just what most people liked to hear him play best, though Kathleen had always liked it as little as anything else that he did. She had never heard anyone else play it till now. And now it was so different. She could scarcely tell the difference, and yet she could feel it in every clear note that Terence drew out with his bow.When she was a little girl, almost as long ago as she could remember, she used to say, when the other Terence played this very music, that it did not mean anything. But now it meant something. Meant something! It meant—everything, Kathleen thought, and yet she could not tell at all what it meant. It was not happiness that it meant, and it was not sorrow; it was not merry, and it was not grave. Sometimes it was light and gentle and sweet, and flowed along as if it were a little fountain of music, bubbling and bubbling out of a hidden place; then it would be slower, but fine and firm, and full and free and true. It seemed to Kathleen to mean so much, and yet she could not tell what, except that there was something like a deep longing that went all through it.And that made her think of the other Terence’s music again, for she remembered now, though she had never thought of it before, that there was a longing in his music too. Perhaps she had done wrong, she thought, to say that it did not mean anything. Still, this was so different. If the other Terence’s fiddle had ever seemed to be longing for anything, it had seemed to be hopeless, and the fiddle always seemed to be bitterly laughing at those who were listening to it and thinking that it was so fine. She had never thought of anything like this before, but it seemed clear to her now, listening to the same music played so differently. For now, below all the longing and sounding through it, there were strength and hope and life and faith in something good.I do not say that Kathleen thought all this out while she was listening. She only felt the most of it. But she felt it so much that she scarcely knew what she was doing, and she moved by little and little toward Terence, till she was nearer to him than anybody else, and looked at him as if he were something more wonderful than she had ever seen before, till she found that she could not look at him, because her eyes were wet. And then the music stopped.Then said the King: “I said that was something that we could understand, Terence, but I dunno if it is. It’s the wonderful player you are all out, but I never heard you play like that before, and I think there’s something in it that’s more than I can find out. That’s enough of it for to-night.”Terence had already come back to Kathleen. She could scarcely speak to him even yet. “Who taught you to play like that?” she said.“I don’t quite know,” he answered, “whether anybody taught me. They taught me to play here, and the music that I just played is their music, but I don’t play it the way they do. I don’t know why that is. Just as soon as they had taught me so that I could play at all, I began to play in my own way. Their music is sweet and bright and merry and sparkling, and sometimes it seems to be sad, but it never means anything.”Kathleen was startled again to hear Terence say the very words that she had said so many times about the other Terence’s music. “But I never played before in my life,” Terence went on, “the way I have been playing just now. I think it was because you were here. You understood, and so I thought of nothing but you all the time that I was playing, and I think it made me play better. They never understand. They love music and they hate geometry, but they understand one just as well as the other.”The King came up to Kathleen and said: “It is time for you to come and be looking after the child again.”Kathleen went with him and he led her back into the room where the Queen was. “Where is the box of ointment?” the King said to the Queen.“I have it here under my pillow,” the Queen answered; “come here and get it, Kathleen.”The Queen took something from under her pillow and held it so that Kathleen had to come close to her to get it. “Did you eat anything?” the Queen asked, as Kathleen bent over her.Kathleen did not quite know whether she ought to answer or not, but the Queen looked at her so kindly that she thought that there could be no harm, and she said: “Only what Terence gave me.”“That was right,” said the Queen, and then she went on, speaking louder, so that the King could hear: “Take this box of ointment. In the morning, as soon as the baby is awake, take him out of the cradle and wash him, and then just touch his eyes with this ointment; but be careful that you do not touch your own eyes with it.”Kathleen took the box, which seemed to be of solid gold, and looked at it. What was in it looked like a soft, green salve. She slipped it into the pocket of her gown. “How shall I know when it is morning?” she asked. It seemed to her that here under the hill there would not be much difference between night and day.“You’ll know it’s morning when the child wakes up,” the Queen said; “or when you wake up yourself, for that matter. You can go to bed now. There’s your bed, next to the cradle.”The King left them, and Kathleen, who was really very tired, lay down on another gold couch, almost like the Queen’s, that had been placed near the cradle, and in a minute she was asleep.It seemed scarcely another minute before she was awake again. She remembered that the Queen had said that when she awoke it would be morning, and she looked to see if the baby was awake too. He was, and she took him out of the cradle. Then she saw a large gold basin full of water. She washed the baby in it, and he stared at her all the time, with big, owlish eyes. Then she took the box of ointment out of her pocket. She touched it with her finger and then touched each of the baby’s eyes with it. Instantly his eyes looked brighter and deeper, and instead of staring at her stupidly, as they had done before, they seemed to look straight through her. Nothing had frightened her at all, and now she was getting so that nothing startled her. So she only laid the baby back in his cradle and put the box of ointment into her pocket.In a moment the King came in and said it was time for breakfast. He and the Queen went out into the hall together and Kathleen followed them. As soon as she was in the hall she saw Terence. He was looking for her and they sat down and ate breakfast together. Then Terence went away.All day, except when it was time for meals, Kathleen sat with the Queen or looked after the baby, though there was really nothing to do for him. Whenever it was time for a meal they went out into the hall, and there Kathleen always found Terence, and she always ate with him, and ate only what he brought her.In the evening the King came to her and said, “Kathleen, it is time for us to go and dance again; come with us.”Then Terence took her by both hands and said, “Don’t go with them; don’t go; if you do, I am afraid that you will never come back.”“Of course I shall come back,” she said; “you have been very kind to me, and I would come back to see you again, if it was for nothing else. And then I don’t know whether I must do anything more for the baby. And then—” Kathleen stopped short as she thought. “I ought not to come back—not to-night! I ought to go home! Oh, how anxious my father and my grandmother must be about me! I have been here all night and all day, and they must think that I am dead. And I have not thought of them the whole time. I am wicked to have stayed here so long.”“Then you will not come back,” Terence said. “You know why I brought you all that you have had to eat and to drink. It was so that you might leave this place. I might have let you eat their food, and then you could never leave it, unless to go out with them and dance on their green and then come back again. I made it so that you could go, and now you will go and you will not come back.”“I will come back,” Kathleen answered, “but I must see my father and my grandmother and tell them that I am safe. Perhaps I will come back to-morrow, if I can, but I will come back. I would come back just because you wanted to see me, you have been so good to me. It was very good of you, if you wanted me to stay, to bring me the things to eat and drink, so that I could go if I liked.”“No, it was not good of me at all,” Terence answered; “I had no right to let them keep you here always, even if I wanted you to be here. But I hoped and I always hope that I shall leave this place some time myself, and I did not want to have to leave you here. I would not have left you here. Promise that you will come back.”“I will come back,” Kathleen answered.“Come along now,” said the King, hurrying up to Kathleen again. “It’s time we were dancing this minute.”All the little men and women were moving out of the hall and Kathleen went with them. In an instant they were again in the passage that Kathleen remembered. The floor was of gold, like the floor of the hall, and then she saw that she was walking on the water once more. The yellow glow was under it still, but fainter than in the hall. The violet light on the walls of the passage grew dimmer; she saw the lights that the men and women carried, shining ahead of her and all around her. Then she looked down at the water and saw the stars shining up through it, as if there were another sky far down under her feet. And then—she felt the cool, fresh breath of the outside air, and it was delicious to her, and she was standing on her own little pool, and deep down under it there were thousands of stars. She and all the others walked—or drifted, as it seemed to Kathleen—up the bank of sweet-smelling new grass, to the little hollowed place, with the trees and the bushes growing around it and hanging over it, where Kathleen had first seen the Good People. And then they began the dance.","['another', 'sort', 'chapter', 'altogether', 'tell', 'happen', 'eighteen', 'year', 'come', 'time', 'something', 'tell', 'eighteen', 'year', 'begin', 'know',

863,irish,The Selfish Giant,"Every afternoon, as they were coming from school, the children used to go and play in the Giant’s garden.It was a large lovely garden, with soft green grass.  Here and there over the grass stood beautiful flowers like stars, and there were twelve peach-trees that in the spring-time broke out into delicate blossoms of pink and pearl, and in the autumn bore rich fruit.  The birds sat on the trees and sang so sweetly that the children used to stop their games in order to listen to them.  “How happy we are here!” they cried to each other.One day the Giant came back.  He had been to visit his friend the Cornish ogre, and had stayed with him for seven years.  After the seven years were over he had said all that he had to say, for his conversation was limited, and he determined to return to his own castle.  When he arrived he saw the children playing in the garden.“What are you doing here?” he cried in a very gruff voice, and the children ran away.“My own garden is my own garden,” said the Giant; “any one can understand that, and I will allow nobody to play in it but myself.”  So he built a high wall all round it, and put up a notice-board.He was a very selfish Giant.The poor children had now nowhere to play.  They tried to play on the road, but the road was very dusty and full of hard stones, and they did not like it.  They used to wander round the high wall when their lessons were over, and talk about the beautiful garden inside.  “How happy we were there,” they said to each other.Then the Spring came, and all over the country there were little blossoms and little birds.  Only in the garden of the Selfish Giant it was still winter.  The birds did not care to sing in it as there were no children, and the trees forgot to blossom.  Once a beautiful flower put its head out from the grass, but when it saw the notice-board it was so sorry for the children that it slipped back into the ground again, and went off to sleep.  The only people who were pleased were the Snow and the Frost.  “Spring has forgotten this garden,” they cried, “so we will live here all the year round.”  The Snow covered up the grass with her great white cloak, and the Frost painted all the trees silver.  Then they invited the North Wind to stay with them, and he came.  He was wrapped in furs, and he roared all day about the garden, and blew the chimney-pots down.  “This is a delightful spot,” he said, “we must ask the Hail on a visit.”  So the Hail came.  Every day for three hours he rattled on the roof of the castle till he broke most of the slates, and then he ran round and round the garden as fast as he could go.  He was dressed in grey, and his breath was like ice.“I cannot understand why the Spring is so late in coming,” said the Selfish Giant, as he sat at the window and looked out at his cold white garden; “I hope there will be a change in the weather.”But the Spring never came, nor the Summer.  The Autumn gave golden fruit to every garden, but to the Giant’s garden she gave none.  “He is too selfish,” she said.  So it was always Winter there, and the North Wind, and the Hail, and the Frost, and the Snow danced about through the trees.One morning the Giant was lying awake in bed when he heard some lovely music.  It sounded so sweet to his ears that he thought it must be the King’s musicians passing by.  It was really only a little linnet singing outside his window, but it was so long since he had heard a bird sing in his garden that it seemed to him to be the most beautiful music in the world.  Then the Hail stopped dancing over his head, and the North Wind ceased roaring, and a delicious perfume came to him through the open casement.  “I believe the Spring has come at last,” said the Giant; and he jumped out of bed and looked out.What did he see?He saw a most wonderful sight.  Through a little hole in the wall the children had crept in, and they were sitting in the branches of the trees.  In every tree that he could see there was a little child.  And the trees were so glad to have the children back again that they had covered themselves with blossoms, and were waving their arms gently above the children’s heads.  The birds were flying about and twittering with delight, and the flowers were looking up through the green grass and laughing.  It was a lovely scene, only in one corner it was still winter.  It was the farthest corner of the garden, and in it was standing a little boy.  He was so small that he could not reach up to the branches of the tree, and he was wandering all round it, crying bitterly.  The poor tree was still quite covered with frost and snow, and the North Wind was blowing and roaring above it.  “Climb up! little boy,” said the Tree, and it bent its branches down as low as it could; but the boy was too tiny.And the Giant’s heart melted as he looked out.  “How selfish I have been!” he said; “now I know why the Spring would not come here.  I will put that poor little boy on the top of the tree, and then I will knock down the wall, and my garden shall be the children’s playground for ever and ever.”  He was really very sorry for what he had done.So he crept downstairs and opened the front door quite softly, and went out into the garden.  But when the children saw him they were so frightened that they all ran away, and the garden became winter again.  Only the little boy did not run, for his eyes were so full of tears that he did not see the Giant coming.  And the Giant stole up behind him and took him gently in his hand, and put him up into the tree.  And the tree broke at once into blossom, and the birds came and sang on it, and the little boy stretched out his two arms and flung them round the Giant’s neck, and kissed him.  And the other children, when they saw that the Giant was not wicked any longer, came running back, and with them came the Spring.  “It is your garden now, little children,” said the Giant, and he took a great axe and knocked down the wall.  And when the people were going to market at twelve o’clock they found the Giant playing with the children in the most beautiful garden they had ever seen.All day long they played, and in the evening they came to the Giant to bid him good-bye.“But where is your little companion?” he said: “the boy I put into the tree.”  The Giant loved him the best because he had kissed him.“We don’t know,” answered the children; “he has gone away.”“You must tell him to be sure and come here to-morrow,” said the Giant.  But the children said that they did not know where he lived, and had never seen him before; and the Giant felt very sad.Every afternoon, when school was over, the children came and played with the Giant.  But the little boy whom the Giant loved was never seen again.  The Giant was very kind to all the children, yet he longed for his first little friend, and often spoke of him.  “How I would like to see him!” he used to say.Years went over, and the Giant grew very old and feeble.  He could not play about any more, so he sat in a huge armchair, and watched the children at their games, and admired his garden.  “I have many beautiful flowers,” he said; “but the children are the most beautiful flowers of all.”One winter morning he looked out of his window as he was dressing.  He did not hate the Winter now, for he knew that it was merely the Spring asleep, and that the flowers were resting.Suddenly he rubbed his eyes in wonder, and looked and looked.  It certainly was a marvellous sight.  In the farthest corner of the garden was a tree quite covered with lovely white blossoms.  Its branches were all golden, and silver fruit hung down from them, and underneath it stood the little boy he had loved.Downstairs ran the Giant in great joy, and out into the garden.  He hastened across the grass, and came near to the child.  And when he came quite close his face grew red with anger, and he said, “Who hath dared to wound thee?”  For on the palms of the child’s hands were the prints of two nails, and the prints of two nails were on the little feet.“Who hath dared to wound thee?” cried the Giant; “tell me, that I may take my big sword and slay him.”“Nay!” answered the child; “but these are the wounds of Love.”“Who art thou?” said the Giant, and a strange awe fell on him, and he knelt before the little child.And the child smiled on the Giant, and said to him, “You let me play once in your garden, to-day you shall come with me to my garden, which is Paradise.”And when the children ran in that afternoon, they found the Giant lying dead under the tree, all covered with white blossoms.","['every', 'afternoon', 'come', 'school', 'child', 'play', 'giant', 'garden', 'large', 'lovely', 'garden', 'soft', 'green', 'grass',

916,irish,Cucúlin,"There was a king in a land not far from Greece who had two daughters, and the younger was fairer than the elder daughter.This old king made a match between the king of Greece and his own elder daughter; but he kept the younger one hidden away till after the marriage. Then the younger daughter came forth to view; and when the king of Greece saw her, he wouldn’t look at his own wife. Nothing would do him but to get the younger sister and leave the elder at home with her father.The king wouldn’t listen to this, wouldn’t agree to the change, so the king of Greece left his wife where she was, went home alone in a terrible rage and collected all his forces to march against the kingdom of his father-in-law.He soon conquered the king and his army and, so far as he was able, he vexed and tormented him. To do this the more completely, he took from him a rod of Druidic spells, enchantment, and ring of youth which he had, and, striking the elder sister with the rod, he said: “You will be a serpent of the sea and live outside there in the bay by the castle.”Then turning to the younger sister, whose name was Gil an Og, he struck her, and said: “You’ll be a cat while inside this castle, and have your own form only when you are outside the walls.”After he had done this, the king of Greece went home to his own country, taking with him the rod of enchantment and the ring of youth. The king died in misery and grief, leaving his two daughters spellbound.Now there was a Druid in that kingdom, and the younger sister went to consult him, and asked: “Shall I ever be released from the enchantment that’s on me now?”“You will not, unless you find the man to release you; and there is no man in the world to do that but a champion who is now with Fin MacCumhail in Erin.”“Well, how can I find that man?” asked she.“I will tell you,” said the Druid. “Do you make a shirt out of your own hair, take it with you, and never stop till you land in Erin and find Fin and his men; the man that the shirt will fit is the man who will release you.”She began to make the shirt and worked without stopping till it was finished. Then she went on her journey and never rested till she came to Erin in a ship. She went on shore and inquired where Fin and his men were to be found at that time of the year.“You will find them at Knock an Ar,” was the answer she got.She went to Knock an Ar carrying the shirt with her. The first man she met was Conan Maol, and she said to him: “I have come to find the man this shirt will fit. From the time one man tries it all must try till I see the man it fits.”The shirt went from hand to hand till Cucúlin put it on. “Well,” said she, “it fits as your own skin.”Now Gil an Og told Cucúlin all that had happened,—how her father had forced her sister to marry the king of Greece, how this king had made war on her father, enchanted her sister and herself, and carried off the rod of enchantment with the ring of youth, and how the old Druid said the man this shirt would fit was the only man in the world who could release them.Now Gil an Og and Cucúlin went to the ship and sailed across the seas to her country and went to her castle.“You’ll have no one but a cat for company to-night,” said Gil an Og. “I have the form of a cat inside this castle, but outside I have my own appearance. Your dinner is ready, go in.”After the dinner Cucúlin went to another room apart, and lay down to rest after the journey. The cat came to his pillow, sat there and purred till he fell asleep and slept soundly till morning.When he rose up, a basin of water, and everything he needed was before him, and his breakfast ready. He walked out after breakfast; Gil an Og was on the green outside before him and said:“If you are not willing to free my sister and myself, I shall not urge you; but if you do free us, I shall be glad and thankful. Many king’s sons and champions before you have gone to recover the ring and the rod; but they have never come back.”“Well, whether I thrive or not, I’ll venture,” said Cucúlin.“I will give you,” said Gil an Og, “a present such as I have never given before to any man who ventured out on my behalf; I will give you the speckled boat.”Cucúlin took leave of Gil an Og and sailed away in the speckled boat to Greece, where he went to the king’s court, and challenged him to combat.The king of Greece gathered his forces and sent them out to chastise Cucúlin. He killed them all to the last man. Then Cucúlin challenged the king a second time.“I have no one now to fight but myself,” said the king; “and I don’t think it becomes me to go out and meet the like of you.”“If you don’t come out to me,” said Cucúlin, “I’ll go in to you and cut the head off you in your own castle.”“That’s enough of impudence from you, you scoundrel,” said the king of Greece. “I won’t have you come into my castle, but I’ll meet you on the open plain.”The king went out, and they fought till Cucúlin got the better of him, bound him head and heels, and said: “I’ll cut the head off you now unless you give me the ring of youth and the rod of enchantment that you took from the father of Gil an Og.”“Well, I did carry them away,” said the king, “but it wouldn’t be easy for me now to give them to you or to her; for there was a man who came and carried them away, who could take them from you and from me, and from as many more of us, if they were here.”“Who was that man?” asked Cucúlin.“His name,” said the king, “is Lug Longhand. And if I had known what you wanted, there would have been no difference between us. I’ll tell you how I lost the ring and rod and I’ll go with you and show you where Lug Longhand lives. But do you come to my castle. We’ll have a good time together.”They set out next day, and never stopped till they came opposite Lug Longhand castle, and Cucúlin challenged his forces to combat.“I have no forces,” said Lug, “but I’ll fight you myself.” So the combat began, and they spent the whole day at one another, and neither gained the victory.The king of Greece himself put up a tent on the green in front of the castle, and prepared everything necessary to eat and drink (there was no one else to do it). After breakfast next day, Cucúlin and Lug began fighting again. The king of Greece looked on as the day before.They fought the whole day till near evening, when Cucúlin got the upper hand of Lug Longhand and bound him head and heels, saying: “I’ll cut the head off you now unless you give me the rod and the ring that you carried away from the king of Greece.”“Oh, then,” said Lug, “it would be hard for me to give them to you or to him; for forces came and took them from me; and they would have taken them from you and from him, if you had been here.”“Who in the world took them from you?” asked the king of Greece.“Release me from this bond, and come to my castle, and I’ll tell you the whole story,” said Lug Longhand.Cucúlin released him, and they went to the castle. They got good reception and entertainment from Lug that night, and the following morning as well. He said: “The ring and the rod were taken from me by the knight of the island of the Flood. This island is surrounded by a chain, and there is a ring of fire seven miles wide between the chain and the castle. No man can come near the island without breaking the chain, and the moment the chain is broken the fire stops burning at that place; and the instant the fire goes down the knight rushes out and attacks and slays every man that’s before him.” The king of Greece, Cucúlin, and Lug Longhand now sailed on in the speckled boat towards the island of the Flood. On the following morning when the speckled boat struck the chain, she was thrown back three days’ sail, and was near being sunk, and would have gone to the bottom of the sea but for her own goodness and strength.As soon as Cucúlin saw what had happened, he took the oars, rowed on again, and drove the vessel forward with such venom that she cut through the chain and went one third of her length on to dry land. That moment the fire was quenched where the vessel struck, and when the knight of the Island saw the fire go out, he rushed to the shore and met Cucúlin, the king of Greece, and Lug Longhand.When Cucúlin saw him, he threw aside his weapons, caught him, raised him above his head, hurled him down on the flat of his back, bound him head and heels, and said: “I’ll cut the head off you unless you give me the ring and the rod that you carried away from Lug Longhand.”“I took them from him, it’s true,” said the knight; “but it would be hard for me to give them to you now; for a man came and took them from me, who would have taken them from you and all that are with you, and as many more if they had been here before him.”“Who in the world could that man be?” asked Cucúlin.“The Dark Gruagach of the Northern Island. Release me, and come to my castle. I’ll tell you all and entertain you well.”He took them to his castle, gave them good cheer, and told them all about the Gruagach and his island. Next morning all sailed away in Cucúlin’s vessel, which they had left at the shore of the island, and never stopped till they came to the Gruagach’s castle, and pitched their tents in front of it.Then Cucúlin challenged the Gruagach. The others followed after to know would he thrive. The Gruagach came out and faced Cucúlin, and they began and spent the whole day at one another and neither of them gained the upper hand. When evening came, they stopped and prepared for supper and the night.Next day after breakfast Cucúlin challenged the Gruagach again, and they fought till evening; when Cucúlin got the better in the struggle, disarmed the Gruagach, bound him, and said: “Unless you give up the rod of enchantment and the ring of youth that you took from the knight of the island of the Flood, I’ll cut the head off you now.”“I took them from him, ’tis true; but there was a man named Thin-in-Iron, who took them from me, and he would have taken them from you and from me, and all that are here, if there were twice as many. He is such a man that sword cannot cut him, fire cannot burn him, water cannot drown him, and ’tis no easy thing to get the better of him. But if you’ll free me now and come to my castle, I’ll treat you well and tell you all about him.” Cucúlin agreed to this.Next morning they would not stop nor be satisfied till they went their way. They found the castle of Thin-in-Iron, and Cucúlin challenged him to combat. They fought; and he was cutting the flesh from Cucúlin, but Cucúlin’s sword cut no flesh from him. They fought till Cucúlin said: “It is time now to stop till to-morrow.”Cucúlin was scarcely able to reach the tent. They had to support him and put him to bed. Now, who should come to Cucúlin that night but Gil an Og, and she said: “You have gone further than any man before you, and I’ll cure you now, and you need go no further for the rod of enchantment and the ring of youth.”“Well,” said Cucúlin, “I’ll never give over till I knock another day’s trial out of Thin-in-Iron.”When it was time for rest, Gil an Og went away, and Cucúlin fell asleep for himself. On the following morning all his comrades were up and facing his tent. They thought to see him dead, but he was in as good health as ever.They prepared breakfast, and after breakfast Cucúlin went before the door of the castle to challenge his enemy.Thin-in-Iron thrust his head out and said: “That man I fought yesterday has come again to-day. It would have been a good deed if I had cut the head off him last night. Then he wouldn’t be here to trouble me this morning. I won’t come home this day till I bring his head with me. Then I’ll have peace.”They met in combat and fought till the night was coming. Then Thin-in-Iron cried out for a cessation, and if he did, Cucúlin was glad to give it; for his sword had no effect upon Thin-in-Iron except to tire and nearly kill him (he was enchanted and no arms could cut him). When Thin-in-Iron went to his castle, he threw up three sups of blood, and said to his housekeeper: “Though his sword could not penetrate me, he has nearly broken my heart.”Cucúlin had to be carried to his tent. His comrades laid him on his bed and said: “Whoever came and healed him yesterday, may be the same will be here to-night.” They went away and were not long gone when Gil an Og came and said: “Cucúlin, if you had done my bidding, you wouldn’t be as you are to-night. But if you neglect my words now, you’ll never see my face again. I’ll cure you this time and make you as well as ever;” and whatever virtue she had she healed him so he was as strong as before.“Oh, then,” said Cucúlin, “whatever comes on me I’ll never turn back till I knock another day’s trial out of Thin-in-Iron.”“Well,” said she, “you are a stronger man than he, but there is no good in working at him with a sword. Throw your sword aside to-morrow, and you’ll get the better of him and bind him. You’ll not see me again.”She went away and he fell asleep. His comrades came in the morning and found him sleeping. They got breakfast, and, after eating, Cucúlin went out and called a challenge.“Oh, ’tis the same man as yesterday,” said Thin-in-Iron, “and if I had cut the head off him then, it wouldn’t be he that would trouble me to-day. If I live for it, I’ll bring his head in my hand to-night, and he’ll never disturb me again.”When Cucúlin saw Thin-in-Iron coming, he threw his sword aside, and facing him, caught him by the body, raised him up, then dashed him to the ground, and said, “If you don’t give me what I want, I’ll cut the head off you.”“What do you want of me?” asked Thin-in-Iron.“I want the rod of enchantment and the ring of youth you carried from the Gruagach.”“I did indeed carry them from him, but it would be no easy thing for me to give them to you or any other man; for a force came which took them from me.”“What could take them from you?” asked Cucúlin.“The queen of the Wilderness, an old hag that has them now. But release me from this bondage and I’ll take you to my castle and entertain you well, and I’ll go with you and the rest of the company to see how will you thrive.”So he took Cucúlin and his friends to the castle and entertained them joyously, and he said: “The old hag, the queen of the Wilderness, lives in a round tower, which is always turning on wheels. There is but one entrance to the tower, and that high above the ground, and in the one chamber in which she lives, keeping the ring and the rod, is a chair, and she has but to sit on the chair and wish herself in any part of the world, and that moment she is there. She has six lines of guards protecting her tower, and if you pass all of these, you’ll do what no man before you has done to this day. The first guards are two lions that rush out to know which of them will get the first bite out of the throat of any one that tries to pass. The second are seven men with iron hurlies and an iron ball, and with their hurlies they wallop the life out of any man that goes their way. The third is Hung-up-Naked, who hangs on a tree with his toes to the earth, his head cut from his shoulders and lying on the ground, and who kills every man who comes near him. The fourth is the bull of the Mist that darkens the woods for seven miles around, and destroys everything that enters the Mist. The fifth are seven cats with poison tails; and one drop of their poison would kill the strongest man.”Next morning all went with Cucúlin as far as the lions who guarded the queen of the Wilderness, an old hag made young by the ring of youth. The two lions ran at Cucúlin to see which would have the first bite out of him.Cucúlin wore a red silk scarf around his neck and had a fine head of hair. He cut the hair off his head and wound it around one hand, took his scarf and wrapped it around the other. Then rushing at the lions, he thrust a hand down the throat of each lion (for lions can bite neither silk nor hair). He pulled the livers and lights out of the two and they fell dead before him. His comrades looking on, said: “You’ll thrive now since you have done this deed;” and they left him and went home, each to his own country.Cucúlin went further. The next people he met were the seven men with the iron hurlies (ball clubs), and they said; “‘Tis long since any man walked this way to us; we’ll have sport now.”The first one said: “Give him a touch of the hurly and let the others do the same; and we’ll wallop him till he is dead.”Now Cucúlin drew his sword and cut the head off the first man before he could make an offer of the hurly at him; and then he did the same to the other six.He went on his way till he came to Hung-up-Naked, who was hanging from a tree, his head on the ground near him. The queen of the Wilderness had fastened him to the tree because he wouldn’t marry her; and she said: “If any man comes who will put your head on you, you’ll be free.” And she laid the injunction on him to kill every man who tried to pass his way without putting the head on him.Cucúlin went up, looked at him, and saw heaps of bones around the tree. The body said: “You can’t go by here. I fight with every man who tries to pass.”“Well, I’m not going to fight with a man unless he has a head on him. Take your head.” And Cucúlin, picking up the head, clapped it on the body, and said, “Now I’ll fight with you!”The man said: “I’m all right now. I know where you are going. I’ll stay here till you come; if you conquer you’ll not forget me. Take the head off me now; put it where you found it; and if you succeed, remember that I shall be here before you on your way home.”Cucúlin went on, but soon met the bull of the Mist that covered seven miles of the wood with thick mist. When the bull saw him, he made at him and stuck a horn in his ribs and threw him three miles into the wood, against a great oak tree and broke three ribs in his side.“Well,” said Cucúlin, when he recovered, “if I get another throw like that, I’ll not be good for much exercise.” He was barely on his feet when the bull was at him again; but when he came up he caught the bull by both horns and away they went wrestling and struggling. For three days and nights Cucúlin kept the bull in play, till the morning of the fourth day, when he put him on the flat of his back. Then he turned him on the side, and putting a foot on one horn and taking the other in his two hands, he said: “‘Tis well I earned you; there is not a stitch on me that isn’t torn to rags from wrestling with you.” He pulled the bull asunder from his horns to his tail, into two equal parts, and said: “Now that I have you in two, it’s in quarters I’ll put you.” He took his sword, and when he struck the backbone of the bull, the sword remained in the bone and he couldn’t pull it out.He walked away and stood awhile and looked. “‘Tis hard to say,” said he, “that any good champion would leave his sword behind him.” So he went back and made another pull and took the hilt off his sword, leaving the blade in the back of the bull. Then he went away tattered and torn, the hilt in his hand, and he turned up towards the forge of the Strong Smith. One of the Smith’s boys was out for coal at the time: he saw Cucúlin coming with the hilt in his hand, and ran in, saying: “There is a man coming up and he looks like a fool; we’ll have fun!”“Hold your tongue!” said the master. “Have you heard any account of the bull of the Mist these three days?”“We have not,” said the boys.“Perhaps,” said the Strong Smith, “that’s a good champion that’s coming, and do you mind yourselves.”At that moment Cucúlin walked in to the forge where twelve boys and the master were working. He saluted them and asked, “Can you put a blade in this hilt?”“We can,” said the master. They put in the blade. Cucúlin raised the sword and took a shake out of it and broke it to bits.“This is a rotten blade,” said he. “Go at it again.”They made a second blade. The boys were in dread of him now. He broke the second blade in the same way as the first. They made six blades, one stronger than the other. He did the same to them all. “There is no use in talking,” said the Strong Smith; “we have no stuff that would make a right blade for you. Go down now,” said he to two of the boys, “and bring up an old sword that’s down in the stable full of rust.”They went and brought up the sword on two hand-spikes between them; it was so heavy that one couldn’t carry it. They gave it to Cucúlin, and with one blow on his heel he knocked the dust from it and went out at the door and took a shake out of it; and if he did, he darkened the whole place with the rust from the blade.“This is my sword, whoever made it,” said he.“It is,” said the master; “it’s yours and welcome. I know who you are now, and where you are going. Remember that I’m in bondage here.” The Strong Smith took Cucúlin then to his house, gave him refreshment and clothes for the journey. When he was ready, the Smith said: “I hope you’ll thrive. You have done a deal more than any man that ever walked this way before. There is nothing now to stand in your way till you come to the seven cats outside the turning tower. If they shake their tails and a drop of poison comes on you, it will penetrate to your heart. You must sweep off their tails with your sword. ‘Tis equal to you what their bodies will do after that.”Cucúlin soon came to them and there wasn’t one of the seven cats he didn’t strip of her tail before she knew he was in it. He cared nothing for the bodies so he had the tails. The cats ran away.Now he faced the tower turning on wheels. The queen of the Wilderness was in it. He had been told by Thin-in-Iron that he must cut the axle. He found the axle, cut it, and the tower stopped that instant. Cucúlin made a spring and went in through the single passage.The old hag was preparing to sit on the chair as she saw him coming. He sprang forward, pushed the chair away with one hand, and, catching her by the back of the neck with the other, said: “You are to lose your head now, old woman!”“Spare me, and what you want you’ll get,” said she. “I have the ring of youth and the rod of enchantment,” and she gave them to him. He put the ring on his finger, and saying, “You’ll never do mischief again to man!” he turned her face to the entrance, and gave her a kick. Out she flew through the opening and down to the ground, where she broke her neck and died on the spot.Cucúlin made the Strong Smith king over all the dominions of the queen of the Wilderness, and proclaimed that any person in the country who refused to obey the new king would be put to death.Cucúlin turned back at once, and travelled till he came to Hung-up-Naked. He took him down, and putting the head on his body, struck him a blow of the rod and made the finest looking man of him that could be found. The man went back to his own home happy and well.Cucúlin never stopped till he came to the castle of Gil an Og. She was outside with a fine welcome before him; and why not, to be sure, for he had the rod of enchantment and the ring of youth!When she entered the castle and took the form of a cat, he struck her a blow of the rod and she gained the same form and face she had before the king of Greece struck her. Then he asked, “Where is your sister?” “In the lake there outside,” answered Gil an Og, “in the form of a sea-serpent.” She went out with him, and the moment they came to the edge of the lake the sister rose up near them. Then Cucúlin struck her with the rod and she came to land in her own shape and countenance.Next day they saw a deal of vessels facing the harbor, and what should they be but a fleet of ships, and on the ships were the king of Greece, Lug Longhand, the knight of the island of the Flood, the Dark Guagach of the Northern Island and Thin-in-Iron: and they came each in his own vessel to know was there any account of Cucúlin. There was good welcome for them all, and when they had feasted and rejoiced together Cucúlin married Gil an Og. The king of Greece took Gil an Og’s sister, who was his own wife at first, and went home.Cucúlin went away himself with his wife Gil an Og, never stopping till he came to Erin; and when he came, Fin MacCumhail and his men were at KilConaly, near the river Shannon.When Cucúlin went from Erin he left a son whose mother was called the Virago of Alba: she was still alive and the son was eighteen years old. When she heard that Cucúlin had brought Gil an Og to Erin, she was enraged with jealousy and madness. She had reared the son, whose name was Conlán, like any king’s son, and now giving him his arms of a champion she told him to go to his father.“I would,” said he, “if I knew who my father is.”“His name is Cucúlin, and he is with Fin MacCumhail. I bind you not to yield to any man,” said she to her son, “nor tell your name to any man till you fight him out.”Conlán started from Ulster where his mother was, and never stopped till he was facing Fin and his men, who were hunting that day along the cliffs of KilConaly.When the young man came up Fin said, “There is a single man facing us.”Conan Maol said, “Let some one go against him, ask who he is and what he wants.”“I never give an account of myself to any man,” said Conlán, “till I get an account from him.”“There is no man among us,” said Conan, “bound in that way but Cucúlin.” They called on Cucúlin; he came up and the two fought. Conlán knew by the description his mother had given that Cucúlin was his father, but Cucúlin did not know his son. Every time Conlán aimed his spear he threw it so as to strike the ground in front of Cucúlin’s toe, but Cucúlin aimed straight at him.They were at one another three days and three nights. The son always sparing the father, the father never sparing the son.Conan Maol came to them the fourth morning. “Cucúlin,” said he, “I didn’t expect to see any man standing against you three days, and you such a champion.”When Conlán heard Conan Maol urging the father to kill him, he gave a bitter look at Conan, and forgot his guard. Cucúlin’s spear went through his head that minute, and he fell. “I die of that blow from my father,” said he.“Are you my son?” said Cucúlin.“I am,” said Conlán.Cucúlin took his sword and cut the head off him sooner than leave him in the punishment and pain he was in. Then he faced all the people, and Fin was looking on.“There’s trouble on Cucúlin,” said Fin. “Chew your thumb,” said Conan Maol, “to know what’s on him.”Fin chewed his thumb, and said, “Cucúlin is after killing his own son, and if I and all my men were to face him before his passion cools, at the end of seven days, he’d destroy every man of us.”“Go now,” said Conan, “and bind him to go down to Bale strand and give seven days’ fighting against the waves of the sea, rather than kill us all.”So Fin bound him to go down. When he went to Bale strand Cucúlin found a great white stone. He grasped his sword in his right hand and cried out: “If I had the head of the woman who sent her son into peril of death at my hand, I’d split it as I split this stone,” and he made four quarters of the stone. Then he strove with the waves seven days and nights till he fell from hunger and weakness, and the waves went over him.","['king', 'land', 'greece', 'daughter', 'young', 'fairer', 'elder', 'daughter',

936,irish,Kil Arthur,"There was a time long ago, and if we had lived then, we shouldn’t be living now.In that time there was a law in the world that if a young man came to woo a young woman, and her people wouldn’t give her to him, the young woman should get her death by the law.There was a king in Erin at that time who had a daughter, and he had a son too, who was called Kil Arthur, son of the monarch of Erin.Now, not far from the castle of the king there was a tinker; and one morning he said to his mother: “Put down my breakfast for me, mother.”“Where are you going?” asked the mother.“I’m going for a wife.”“I am going for the daughter of the king of Erin.”“Oh! my son, bad luck is upon you. It is death to ask for the king’s daughter, and you a tinker.”“I don’t care for that,” said he.So the tinker went to the king’s castle. They were at dinner when he came, and the king trembled as he saw him.Though they were at table, the tinker went into the room.The king asked: “What did you come for at this time?”“I came to marry your daughter.”“That life and strength may leave me if ever you get my daughter in marriage! I’d give her to death before I would to a tinker.”Now Kil Arthur, the king’s son, came in, caught the tinker and hanged him, facing the front of the castle. When he was dead, they made seven parts of his body, and flung them into the sea.Then the king had a box made so close and tight that no water could enter, and inside the box they fixed a coffin; and when they had put a bed with meat and drink into the coffin, they brought the king’s daughter, laid her on the bed, closed the box, and pushed it into the open sea. The box went out with the tide and moved on the water for a long time; where it was one day it was not the next,—carried along by the waves day and night, till at last it came to another land.Now, in the other land was a man who had spent his time in going to sea, till at length he got very poor, and said: “I’ll stay at home now, since God has let me live this long. I heard my father say once that if a man would always rise early and walk along the strand, he would get his fortune from the tide at last.”One morning early, as this man was going along the strand, he saw the box, and brought it up to the shore, where he opened it and took out the coffin. When the lid was off the coffin, he found a woman inside alive.“Oh!” said he, “I’d rather have you there than the full of the box of gold.”“I think the gold would be better for you,” said the woman.Then he went home and invited Ri Fohin to dinner. He came with all the men, women, and beasts he had, and they covered the country for six miles.The beasts were fed outside by themselves, but the people in the house. When dinner was over, he asked Ri Fohin: “Have you ever seen a house so fine and rich, or a dinner so good, as mine to-night?”“I have not,” said Ri Fohin.Then the man went to each person present. Each gave the same answer, and said, “I have never seen such a house nor such a dinner.”He asked his wife, and she said: “My praise is no praise here; but what is this to the house and the feasting of my father, the king of Erin?”“Why did you say that?” asked the man, and he went a second and a third time to the guests and to his wife. All had the same answers for him. Then he gave his wife a flip of the thumb on her ear, in a friendly way, and said: “Why don’t you give good luck to my house; why do you give it a bad name?”Then all the guests said: “It is a shame to strike your wife on the night of a feast.”Now the man was angry and went out of his house. It was growing dark, but he saw a champion coming on a black steed between earth and air; and the champion, who was no other than Kil Arthur, his brother-in-law, took him up and bore him away to the castle of the king of Erin.When Kil Arthur arrived they were just sitting down to dinner in the castle, and the man dined with his father-in-law. After dinner the king of Erin had cards brought and asked his son-in-law: “Do you ever play with these?”“No, I have never played with the like of them.”“Well, shuffle them now,” said the king. He shuffled; and as they were enchanted cards and whoever held them could never lose a game he was the best player in the world, though he had never played a game before in his life.The king said, “Put them in your pocket, they may do you good.” Then the king gave him a fiddle, and asked:“Have you ever played on the like of this?”“Indeed I have not,” said the man.“Well, play on it now,” said the king.He played, and never in his life had he heard such music.“Keep it,” said the king; “as long as you don’t let it from you, you’re the first musician on earth. Now I’ll give you something else. Here is a cup which will always give you every kind of drink you can wish for; and if all the men in the world were to drink out of it they could never empty it. Keep these three things; but never raise hand on your wife again.”The king of Erin gave him his blessing; then Kil Arthur took him up on the steed, and going between earth and sky he was soon back at his own home.Now Ri Fohin had carried off the man’s wife and all that he had while he was at dinner with the King of Erin. Going out on the road the king’s son-in-law began to cry: “Oh, what shall I do; what shall I do!” and as he cried, who should come but Kil Arthur on his steed, who said, “Be quiet, I’ll go for your wife and goods.”Kil Arthur went, and killed Ri Fohin and all his people and beasts,—didn’t leave one alive. Then he brought back his sister to her husband, and stayed with them for three years.One day he said to his sister: “I am going to leave you. I don’t know what strength I have; I’ll walk the world now till I know is there a man in it as good as myself.”Next morning he bade good-bye to his sister, and rode away on his black-haired steed, which overtook the wind before and outstripped the wind behind. He travelled swiftly till evening, spent the night in a forest, and the second day hurried on as he had the first.The second night he spent in a forest; and next morning as he rose from the ground he saw before him a man covered with blood from fighting, and the clothes nearly torn from his body.“What have you been doing?” asked Kil Arthur.“I have been playing cards all night. And where are you going?” inquired the stranger of Kil Arthur.“I am going around the world to know can I find a man as good as myself.”“Come with me,” said the stranger, “and I’ll show you a man who couldn’t find his match till he went to fight the main ocean.”Kil Arthur went with the ragged stranger till they came to a place from which they saw a giant out on the ocean beating the waves with a club.Kil Arthur went up to the giant’s castle, and struck the pole of combat such a blow that the giant in the ocean heard it above the noise of his club as he pounded the waves.“What do you want?” asked the giant in the ocean, as he stopped from the pounding.“I want you to come in here to land,” said Kil Arthur, “and fight with a better man than yourself.”The giant came to land, and standing near his castle said to Kil Arthur: “Which would you rather fight with,—gray stones or sharp weapons?”“Gray stones,” said Kil Arthur.They went at each other, and fought the most terrible battle that either of them had ever seen till that day. At last Kil Arthur pushed the giant to his shoulders through solid earth.“Take me out of this,” cried the giant, “and I’ll give you my sword of light that never missed a blow, my Druidic rod of most powerful enchantment, and my healing draught which cures every sickness and wound.”“Well,” said Kil Arthur, “I’ll go for your sword and try it.”He went to the giant’s castle for the sword, the rod, and the healing draught. When he returned the giant said: “Try the sword on that tree out there.”“Oh,” said Kil Arthur, “there is no tree so good as your own neck,” and with that he swept off the head of the giant; took it, and went on his way till he came to a house. He went in and put the head on a table; but that instant it disappeared,—went away of itself. Food and drink of every kind came on the table. When Kil Arthur had eaten and the table was cleared by some invisible power, the giant’s head bounded on to the table, and with it a pack of cards. “Perhaps this head wants to play with me,” thought Kil Arthur, and he cut his own cards and shuffled them.The head took up the cards and played with its mouth as well as any man could with his hands. It won all the time,—wasn’t playing fairly. Then Kil Arthur thought: “I’ll settle this;” and he took the cards and showed how the head had taken five points in the game that didn’t belong to it. Then the head sprang at him, struck and beat him till he seized and hurled it into the fire.As soon as he had the head in the fire a beautiful woman stood before him, and said: “You have killed nine of my brothers, and this was the best of the nine. I have eight more brothers who go out to fight with four hundred men each day, and they kill them all; but next morning the four hundred are alive again and my brothers have to do battle anew. Now my mother and these eight brothers will be here soon; and they’ll go down on their bended knees and curse you who killed my nine brothers, and I’m afraid your blood will rise within you when you hear the curses, and you’ll kill my eight remaining brothers.”“Oh,” said Kil Arthur, “I’ll be deaf when the curses are spoken; I’ll not hear them.” Then he went to a couch and lay down. Presently the mother and eight brothers came, and cursed Kil Arthur with all the curses they knew. He heard them to the end, but gave no word from himself.Next morning he rose early, girded on his nine-edged sword, went forth to where the eight brothers were going to fight the four hundred, and said to the eight: “Sit down, and I’ll fight in your place.”Kil Arthur faced the four hundred, and fought with them alone; and exactly at midday he had them all dead. “Now some one,” said he, “brings these to life again. I’ll lie down among them and see who it is.”Soon he saw an old hag coming with a brush in her hand, and an open vessel hanging from her neck by a string. When she came to the four hundred she dipped the brush into the vessel and sprinkled the liquid which was in it over the bodies of the men. They rose up behind her as she passed along.“Bad luck to you,” said Kil Arthur, “you are the one that keeps them alive;” then he seized her. Putting one of his feet on her two ankles, and grasping her by the head and shoulders, he twisted her body till he put the life out of her.When dying she said: “I put you under a curse, to keep on this road till you come to the ‘ram of the five rocks,’ and tell him you have killed the hag of the heights and all her care.”He went to the place where the ram of the five rocks lived and struck the pole of combat before his castle. Out came the ram, and they fought till Kil Arthur seized his enemy and dashed the brains out of him against the rocks.Then he went to the castle of the beautiful woman whose nine brothers he had killed, and for whose eight brothers he had slain the four hundred. When he appeared the mother rejoiced; the eight brothers blessed him and gave him their sister in marriage; and Kil Arthur took the beautiful woman to his father’s castle in Erin, where they both lived happily and well.","['time', 'long', 'live', 'living', 'time', 'world', 'young', 'come', 'young', 'woman', 'people', 'give', 'young', 'woman', 'death', 'king', 'erin', 'time', 'daughter',

941,irish,A Chapter You Can Skip,"This is a chapter that you can skip, if you want to. And really I should advise you to. Nothing of importance happened in the next eighteen years. Of course I am obliged to write a little something to fill in all that time, but you are not obliged to read it. That is where you have such an advantage. I think it is much better for a book to have some parts that can be skipped just as well as not, you get through it so much faster. I have often thought what a good thing it would be if somebody would write a book that we could skip the whole of. I think a good many people would like to have such a book as that. I know I should.Then there is another reason why it will be well for you to skip a little about here. When you get farther on, if you happen to come to something that you don’t understand, you can say: “Oh, this is probably all explained by something in that part that I skipped,” and you can go right on. But if you had not skipped anything and then came to something that you did not understand, you would have to say: “There, now, I must have been reading carelessly and missed something,” and you would have to go back and read the book all through again.In these eighteen years Kathleen O’Brien and Terence Sullivan were growing up. I don’t suppose there ever was another such child as Kathleen. And I should hope there never was another such child as Terence. Kathleen’s grandmother had the most of the care of her, of course, but it was really no care at all. It would have been a pleasure for anybody to have the care of Kathleen. Even when she was a baby she was a perfect delight, and you know what babies are sometimes. At any rate, you would know, if you had known Terence. And when she got to be a few years older, say seven or eight—Well, it is perfectly impossible for me to tell you how good and lovely Kathleen was. It is all very well to try to describe snow-capped mountains at sunrise, or a storm at sea, or moonlight at Niagara, or a prairie on fire, or anything of that sort, but nobody could tell you how good and lovely Kathleen was, so that you could understand it. I suppose she was a good deal the sort of child that you would be if you didn’t put your elbows on the table, or your spoon in your mouth, or slam the doors, or cry when your hair is combed, or tease for things that you ought not to have, or whisper in company, or talk out loud when there are older persons present, or leave your playthings about when you are done with them, or get your clothes soiled when you play out of doors, or want to play at all when you ought to study your lessons, or ask to be allowed to sit up after bed-time, or bite your nails, or cut your bread, or leave your spoon in your cup instead of in your saucer, or take the biggest apple.I don’t say that Kathleen never did any of these things. I only say that she was so good that you would have to leave off every one of them or you would never catch up with her. If Kathleen had a fault, it was that she was too good. If I were going to have anything to do with her I would rather she should be a little bit worse than a single bit better. I am so glad you are skipping this part, because I shouldn’t want you to try to be a bit worse than you are just for the sake of pleasing me. And I don’t mean by all this that Kathleen was one of those children who are a bother all the time because they are so good. She may have done things that she ought not to do sometimes. I dare say she did. I know she did once. I will tell you all about that in the next chapter. She was just a dear, sweet little girl, as bright and merry and healthy as any little girl in the world ever was. And you would think so yourself, if you had known her and were not so jealous. If I should tell you that she was as pretty as she was good, I don’t suppose you would believe me. But she was, just as surely as I am writing this book and you are reading it. I mean just as surely as I am writing it. I am not sure yet whether you are reading it or not.But Terence! Well, the less said about him the better. Still, I suppose, I shall have to say something. He did every one of the things that I have just mentioned. And it wasn’t because he didn’t know any better; he seemed to like to do them, just because he knew that they were wrong. When he was a baby he was more trouble than twins, and bad twins at that. He cried all the time, except when he was eating or sleeping, and he slept only a little of the time and ate a great deal of it. He always seemed to be just about so sick, but it never hurt his appetite and he never got any sicker. After a while Ellen got used to his being sick, and she always said that he was delicate, poor child, and that was why he was so cross and so much trouble.“And is that why he eats so much?” Mrs. O’Brien would ask.“I dunno about that,” Ellen would answer; “I think it’s the kind of sickness that’s on him that makes him eat so much.”“More likely it’s eating so much that gives him the kind of sickness that’s on him,” Mrs. O’Brien would say. “But I tell you again, it’s no sickness at all he has. He’s just one of the Good People, and you could be rid of him and have your own child back any time you would do any of the things I would tell you.”But not a word of this would Ellen ever heed. Terence was her own child, and he might be a bit troublesome, as any child might, but he was not really bad at all, and it was Kathleen, that was always so good, the Lord knew why, that made Mrs. O’Brien think that every child ought to be that way. But there was one strange thing about Terence, and Ellen herself had to admit it. After that very hour, when he was one day old, when Mrs. O’Brien came to see him and christened him, or tried to—she never felt sure till long afterward whether she had done it or not—he was always quiet when she was near. He would drive poor Ellen nearly crazy, in spite of all her excuses for him, when he was alone with her, but the moment that Mrs. O’Brien came into the house he would get as far away from her as he could, and then lie perfectly still and watch her, for all the world, as John said once, like a rat in a trap watching a cat. Ellen said that it was because he always remembered that it was Mrs. O’Brien who had dropped him once. To this John replied: “Then maybe he’ld be making you less trouble, Ellen, if you was to drop him yourself once or twice.” But Mrs. O’Brien said that it was just because he knew what she would do to him if she had the chance.And there was another strange thing about Terence. As he grew a little older, he never could be got inside a church. Father Duffy had never even seen him, except when he came to the house while he was still a baby, and then Terence would scream and kick so, when the good priest came near him, that he never dared touch him. The first time that he came, Ellen told him about Mrs. O’Brien’s christening the child, and asked him if it was right for her to do it.“Was the child looking sick, and as if he was likely to die?” Father Duffy asked.“He was, father,” Ellen answered; “I couldn’t deny that.”“Then it was right for her to christen him,” the priest answered, “and he’ll not need to be christened again. In fact, he can’t be christened again.”But long after that, when they tried to take him to church, he would never go. If Peter and Ellen started for church with him he would run away from them. They could not even hold him. He would get away from them, and sometimes they could not tell how he did it, only he would be gone. And then the only way that they could find him was to go home again, and there he was sure to be, as safe as ever, only he had not been at church. And so, after a while, they stopped trying to make him go.When the two children were old enough to play together, Terence never seemed to be happy except when he was with Kathleen. He did not care in the least to play with other boys. He did not seem to care in the least to play at all. All he wanted was to be with Kathleen. Kathleen never liked him, and she did not like to have him with her so much of the time. But she was too kind-hearted to hurt anybody in any way, even a boy whom she did not like, so she tried to treat him as nicely as she could, and she told nobody but her grandmother, to whom she told everything, that she was not as pleased to be with him as he was to be with her.Terence, in his turn, did not always treat Kathleen well, any more than he did anybody else. He was ill-natured with her and he played tricks on her that were not pleasant at all, and yet he wanted to be always with her. Perhaps it was partly because she was more kind to him than anybody else, except Ellen. For nobody else liked him. And if he was bad-tempered and unkind to other people, it made other people unkind and bad-tempered to him, but nothing could make Kathleen unkind to anybody.“It’s not fair you all are to Terence,” Ellen said once to Mrs. O’Brien, “to think bad of him the way you do. There’s things about him that don’t seem right, I know, but those things don’t show the way he really is. I dunno if I’m making you understand me. I’m his mother and I know him better nor anybody else, and I know he’s different from the way he seems to you, and even the way he seems to me sometimes. And I’ll tell you how I know that. When I’m asleep I often dream about him. And when I dream about him, he looks a little the way he does other times, but he’s taller and he’s better-looking in the face, and he looks stronger and brighter and healthier like. And he speaks to me, and his voice is lower and pleasanter in the sound of it. And that’s the way he’ld be, I know, if he had his health, poor child, and if everything was right with him. And you’ld all know that and you’ld feel more for him, if you knew him the way I do.”This was when Terence was six or seven years old. And Ellen often spoke in this way afterward. She saw Terence in her dreams, and he was a very different Terence from the one who made her so much trouble when she was awake, and yet he was partly the same.And there was one thing that Terence did that almost everybody liked. I might as well say everybody except Kathleen. He played the fiddle. Nobody knew how he learned. There was a neighbor of the Sullivans who came from the same county in Ireland that they did, and he played a fiddle in an orchestra at a cheap theatre. One day Peter had gone to see this man and had taken little Terence with him. The fiddle was lying on the table. The two men went into another room and left Terence by himself. They were talking busily and they forgot about him. Then they heard a soft little tune played on the fiddle. “Who’s that playing my fiddle?” said the owner of it.“Sure,” said Peter, “we left nobody there but Terence.”They went quickly back into the room and found Terence hastily laying the fiddle down where he had found it. “Ah, can’t I leave you alone a minute,” said Peter, “but you must be meddling with things that don’t belong to you? What’ll I do now if you’ve gone and hurt the fiddle?”“Don’t be talking that way to the child,” said the musician; “sure he did it no harm. But where at all did he learn to play that way? That’s what I’m thinking. Have you been letting him learn all this time and never told me?”“He never learned at all that I know of,” Peter answered. “I never saw him have a fiddle in his hand till this minute.”“It’s a strange thing, then,” the musician said. “Anybody that can play a tune like he did that one has a right to play more and better. Where did you learn it, my boy?”“I never learned it at all,” Terence answered; “I just saw the fiddle there and I thought I’ld see could I play it. But it’s little I could be doing with it, I’m thinking.”Peter was surprised enough to find that Terence could play a tune on a fiddle, and so was Ellen, when she heard about it. But they did not wonder at it so much as they would have done if they had known more about such things. They had a sort of notion that one person could play the fiddle and another could not, much as one person can move his ears and another cannot. So they thought little about it. But when Terence begged them to buy him a fiddle of his own, they saved up money a little at a time, and at last they bought him one.Then for days Terence did nothing but play. He played simple little tunes at first, but soon he began to play harder ones. Then he got impatient with himself, as it seemed, and he began to play such music as nobody who heard him had ever heard before. Often he would not play when he was asked, but he would play for hours by himself, when he thought that no one was listening. His father brought his friend the musician to hear him, and he said that it was wonderful. He had never heard the fiddle played so well. Nobody had ever heard the fiddle played so well.And Kathleen never cared to hear Terence play. She did hear him play, many times, of course, and she listened politely, but she told her grandmother that she did not care about it at all. She would much rather hear the poor fiddler of the little orchestra, who had come from their county in Ireland. Their neighbor the fiddler himself was as much shocked as anyone to hear Kathleen talk like this. “Did you ever hear anybody play the fiddle like Terence plays it?” he asked her, when she said something of the sort to him.“No,” Kathleen answered. “I never heard anybody play it like Terence, but I have heard some play it better than Terence. You play it better.”“Oh, child,” he said, “I’ld give all the money I’ll be earning in the next ten years if I could play like he does. Don’t you see I can’t do half the things he does with it?”“I know that,” Kathleen said; “it isn’t the way he plays a bit that makes everybody talk so about him; it’s just the things he does. When he plays a tune it just doesn’t mean anything, and when you play a tune it does.”And that was as near as Kathleen could ever come to telling why she did not care about Terence’s playing. Everybody else said that it was wonderful, but she said that it didn’t mean anything. And when Kathleen talked in this way they said that she was too critical. That is what people will always tell you when you can see through a fraud and they cannot.You will suppose, without my telling you, that as soon as Kathleen was old enough to listen to them, her grandmother began telling her the old stories of Ireland. Often Terence would come and listen to them, too, for he seemed to be less afraid of Mrs. O’Brien as he grew a little older. But it never seemed to be because of the stories that he came; he only wanted to be near Kathleen.Mrs. O’Brien told the children stories about the Good People, and about the old heroes and kings of Ireland who had fought to save the country from its enemies. Terence never liked the stories about the Good People. “Don’t be telling us about them fairies all the time,” he would say. “Tell us about men; that’s what I like better.”“Don’t call them by that name,” Mrs. O’Brien would answer. “They don’t like it, and if you call them by it they may do you harm.”“I’ll call them what I like,” Terence would say, “and they’ll do me no harm. It’s a worthless lot they are, and you know that same yourself, Mrs. O’Brien, if you’ld only think so. They can do no harm to you, or to any woman or man that knows how to deal with them. Why will you bother with them all the time?”And all this made Mrs. O’Brien think the more that Terence was one of them.One day Mrs. O’Brien happened to tell the children a ghost story. I don’t know whether your mother allows you to read ghost stories. I don’t see any harm in them myself, any more than Mrs. O’Brien did, but some people do, and if your mother does, then it is lucky that you are skipping this part. I think that your mother will be very glad that you skipped this part with the ghost story in it. That is, of course, she won’t really be glad, because, since you are skipping it, you won’t know that there is any ghost story here, and so you won’t tell your mother that you skipped a ghost story, and so she won’t really care whether you skipped it or not. What I mean is that if you had read it instead of skipping it, so that you could tell your mother that there was a ghost story, she would be glad that you had skipped—well, what is the use of my trying to tell you what I mean, as long as you are skipping it, anyway? I had better go on with the story.“Once a man was coming home from a funeral,” said Mrs. O’Brien. “As he was walking along the road, near a churchyard, he found the head of a man. He took it up and left it in the churchyard. Then he went on his way, and soon he met a man who looked like a gentleman.“‘Where have you been?’ said the gentleman.“‘I was at a funeral,’ said the man, ‘and as I came back I found the head of a man, and I left it in the churchyard.’“‘It was well for you that you did that,’ said the gentleman. ‘That was my head, and if you had done any wrong by it, it would be the worse for you.’“‘And how did you lose your head, then?’ the man asked.“‘I did not lose it,’ the gentleman answered; ‘I left it on the road, where you found it, to see what you would do with it.’“‘Then you must be one of the Good People,’ said the man, ‘and it’s sorry I am that I met you.’“‘Don’t be afraid,’ said the gentleman. ‘I’ll do you no harm, and I may do you good.’“‘I’m obliged to you,’ said the man; ‘will you come home with me to dinner?’“They went to the man’s house, and the man told his wife to get dinner ready for them. When they had eaten dinner they played cards, and then they went to bed and slept till morning. In the morning they had breakfast, and after a while the gentleman said: ‘Come with me.’“‘Where am I to come with you?’ the man asked.“‘I want you to see the place where I live,’ the gentleman said.“They went together till they came to the churchyard. The gentleman pointed to a tombstone and said: ‘Lift it up.’“The man lifted it up, and there was a stairway underneath. They went down the stairs together till they came to a door, and it led into a kitchen. Two women were sitting by the fire. Said the gentleman to one of the women: ‘Get up and get dinner ready for us.’“The woman got up and brought some small potatoes. ‘Are those all you have for us?’ the gentleman asked.“‘Those are all I have,’ the woman answered.“‘As those are all you have,’ said the gentleman, ‘keep them.’“Then he said to the other woman: ‘Get up and get dinner ready for us.’“The woman got up and brought some meal and husks. ‘Are those all you have?’ the gentleman asked.“‘Those are all I have,’ the woman answered.“‘As those are all you have,’ said the gentleman, ‘keep them.’“He led the man up the stairs and knocked at a door. A beautiful woman opened it. She was dressed in a gown of silk, and it was all trimmed with gold and jewels. He asked her if she could give him and the stranger a dinner. Then she placed before them the finest dinner that was ever seen. And when they had eaten and drunk as much as they liked, the gentleman said: ‘Do you know why this woman was able to give us such a dinner?’“‘I do not know,’ said the man, ‘but I should like to know, if you care to tell me.’“‘When I was alive,’ said the gentleman, ‘I had three wives. And the first wife I had would never give anything to any poor man but little potatoes. And now she has nothing but little potatoes herself, and she can give nothing else to anyone, till the Day of Judgment. And my second wife would never give anything to the poor but meal and husks, and now she has nothing but meal and husks herself, and she can give nothing else to anyone, till the Day of Judgment. But my third wife always gave to the poor the best that she had, and so she will always have the best that there is in the world, and she can always give the best in the world to anyone, till the Day of Judgment.’“Then the gentleman took the man about and showed him his house, and it was a palace, more beautiful than anything that he had ever seen. And while he was walking about it he heard music. And he thought that he had never heard music so beautiful. And while he was listening to the music he felt like sleeping, so he lay down and slept. And when he woke he was in his own home. He never saw the gentleman again and he could never find the place where he had been.”“It’s all the time fairies and ghosts with you, Mrs. O’Brien,” Terence said. “Who cares what they do? It’s what men do that counts. I’ll tell you a story now.”So Mrs. O’Brien and Kathleen listened to Terence’s story.“There was three men,” Terence began, “that lived near together, and their names was Hudden and Dudden and Donald. Each one of them had an ox that he’ld be ploughing with. Donald was a cleverer man than the others and he got on better. So the other two put their heads together to think what would they do to hurt Donald and to ruin him entirely, so that he’ld have to give up his farm and they could get it cheap. Well, after a while they thought that if they could kill his ox he couldn’t plough his land, and then he’ld lose the use of it and he’ld have to give it up. So one night they went and killed Donald’s ox.“And to be sure, when Donald found his ox killed, he thought it was all over with him. But he wasn’t the man to be thinking that way long. So he thought he’d better make the best he could of it, and he took the skin off the ox and started with it to the town to sell it. And as he was going along a magpie perched on the skin and began pecking at it, and all the time chattering, for it had been taught to talk. With that Donald put round his hand and caught the magpie and held it under his coat.“He went on to the town and sold the skin, and then he went to an inn for a drink. He followed the landlady down into the cellar, and while she was drawing the liquor he pinched the magpie and it began chattering again. ‘By the powers,’ says the landlady, ‘who’s that talking and what’s he saying at all?’“‘It’s a bird,’ says Donald, ‘that I carry around with me, and it knows a great deal and tells me many a thing that it’s good for me to know. And it’s after telling me just now that the liquor you’re giving me is not the best you have.’“‘It’s the wonderful bird all out,’ says the landlady, and with that she went to another cask for the liquor. Then said she: ‘Will you sell that bird?’“‘I wouldn’t like to do that,’ says Donald. ‘It’s a valuable bird, and then it’s been my friend a long time, and I dunno what it would be thinking of me if I’d sell it.’“‘Maybe I’ld make it worth your while.’ said the landlady.“‘I’m a poor man,’ says Donald.“‘I’ll fill your hat with silver,’ says the landlady, ‘if you’ll leave me the bird.’“‘I couldn’t refuse that,’ says Donald; ‘you may have the bird.’“So she filled his hat with silver, and he left her the bird and went on his way home.“It wasn’t long after he got home till he met Hudden and Dudden. ‘Aha!’ says he to them, ‘you thought it was the bad turn you was doing me, but you couldn’t have done me a better. Look what I got for the hide of my ox, that you killed on me.’ And he showed them the hatful of silver. ‘You never saw such a demand for hides in your life,’ says he, ‘as there is in the town this present time.’“No sooner had he said that than Hudden and Dudden went home and killed their own oxen and set off for the town to sell the hides. But when they got there they could get no more for them than the common price of hides, and they came home again vowing vengeance on Donald.“This time they were bound there would be no mistake about it, so they went to his house and they seized him and put him into a sack and tied up the top of it. ‘Now,’ says one of them, ‘you’ll not be doing us any dirty turn this time, I’m thinking. We’re going to take you to the river and throw you in and drown you; that’s what we’re going to do and I’m telling you of it now, so that you’ll have the pleasure of thinking that all your sorrows are nearly over, as you go along.’“Well, Donald said never a word, but he kept thinking, and those words ‘all your sorrows are nearly over’ gave him something particular to think about, and it wasn’t long till he began to see his way, if he could only get a chance to do what he was thinking of.“They took up the sack and they carried it by turns for a time, but both of them soon began to get mighty tired and thirsty. Then they came to a tavern, and they left the sack outside, and Donald in it, and went in to get a drink. Donald knew that if they once began drinking they would stay inside for some time. Then presently he heard a great trampling sound, and he knew it must be a herd of cattle coming, and he knew there must be somebody driving them. With that he began singing, like he was the happiest man in the world.“The man that was driving the cattle came up to him and he says: ‘Who’s inside the sack there, and what are you singing like that for?’“‘I’m singing because I’m the happiest man alive,’ says Donald. ‘I had plenty of troubles in my life, but I’m going to heaven now, and they’re all over. There’s a blessing on this same sack, you must know, and whoever’s in it goes straight to heaven, and isn’t it myself that’s a right to be singing?’“‘Surely you have,’ says the man, ‘and it’s glad I’ld be to take your place. What would you take from me now to let me get in that sack in your place?’“‘There’s not money enough in the world to make me do it,’ says Donald, and he began singing again.“‘Ah, be reasonable!’ says the man. ‘I’ll pay you well.’“‘I tell you the whole world couldn’t do it,’ says Donald. ‘It’s not every day a man gets a chance to go to heaven. Think of being over with all the sorrows and the troubles of this world, and nothing but happiness any more forever. Sure I’ld be a fool if I’ld give it up.’“‘Oh, but think of me,’ says the man. ‘It’s me that has the sorrows on me so that I can’t bear them. There’s my wife died three months ago, and all the children was dead before her, and it was she always helped me with the farm and knew how to manage better nor myself, so that now she’s gone I can do nothing with it. And I’ve lost money on it till I can’t pay the rent, and now I’ll lose the farm itself, and here I am driving these cattle to town to sell them to get money to take another piece of land and keep the life in me, and yet I don’t want to live at all. Oh, give me your place in that sack and you’ll go to heaven in your own time, if it was only for that one good deed. Give me your place and I’ll give you these twenty fine cattle, and you’ll have better luck nor me and you’ll surely do well with them.’“‘I can’t resist you,’ says Donald; ‘sure it’s you needs to go to heaven more nor me. It’s the truth I hate to do it, but I’ll give you my place.’“So with that the man untied the sack and Donald got out of it and he got into it, and Donald tied it up again. Then Donald went away home, driving the cattle before him.“It was not long then till Hudden and Dudden came out of the inn, and they took up the sack, thinking that Donald was still inside it, and they took it to the river and threw it into a deep place. Then they went home, and there they found Donald before them, and a herd of the finest cattle they ever saw. ‘How is this, Donald?’ they said. ‘We drowned you in the river, and here you are back home before us. And where are you after getting all these cattle?’“‘Oh, sure,’ says Donald, ‘it’s myself has the bad luck all out. Here I’ve only twenty of these cattle, and if I’d only had help I could have had a hundred—aye, or five hundred. Sure in the place where you threw me in, down at the bottom of the river, there was hundreds of the finest cattle you ever saw, and plenty of gold besides. Oh, it’s the misfortunate creature that I am, not to have any help while I was down there. Just these poor twenty was all I could manage to drive away with me, and these not the best that was there.’“Then they both swore that they would be his friends if he would only show them the place in the river where they could get cattle like his. So he said he’ld show them the place and they could drive home as many of them as they liked. Well, Hudden and Dudden was in such a hurry they couldn’t get to the river soon enough, and when they were there Donald picked up a stone, and said he: ‘Watch where I throw this stone, and that’s where you’ll find the most of the cattle.’“Then he threw the stone into a deep part of the river, and he said: ‘One of you jump in there now, and if you find more of the cattle than you can manage, just come to the top and call for help, and the other two of us will come in and help you.’“So Hudden jumped in first and he went straight to the bottom. In a minute he came up to the top and shouted: ‘Help! help!’“‘He’s calling for help,’ says Donald; ‘wait now till I go in and help him.’“‘Stay where you are,’ says Dudden; ‘haven’t you cattle enough already? It’s my turn to have some of them now.’ And in he jumped, and Hudden and Dudden was both drowned. And then Donald went home and looked after his cattle and his farm, and soon he made money enough to take the two farms that Hudden and Dudden had left, besides his own.“And that’s the way,” said Terence, “to get on in this world or any world. Get the better of them that’s trying to get the better of you, and don’t hope for any help from fairies or ghosts.”“Terence,” said Mrs. O’Brien, “there’s a little that’s right in what you say, and there’s more that’s wrong. Depend on yourself and don’t look for help from Good People or ghosts. So much of what you say is right. But Donald was not honest and he got on by tricks, and I don’t want you or Kathleen to be that way. You’ll not get on that way; you’ll only come to grief. But I want you to be kind and helpful to mortals and Good People because it’s right to be so, not to get any reward. The reward you may get or you may not in this world, but it’s not that I want you to work for. And I’ll tell you a story now to show you what I mean.“There was a poor little bit of a boy once, and he had a hump on his back. He made his living by plaiting rushes and straw into hats and baskets and beehives, and he could do it better than anybody else for miles around. I don’t know what his right name was, but the people called him Lusmore, after the flower of that name. The flower, you know, is the one that some call fairy-cap—the Lord between us and harm!—and others call it foxglove. And they called him after it, because he would always be wearing a sprig of it in his cap. And in spite of having a crooked back, which often makes a body sulky, he was a good-natured little fellow, and never had a bad word or a bad thought for anybody.“One day he had been at a fair to sell some of the things that he made out of straw and rushes, and as he was coming home he felt tired with the long walk. So he sat down to rest for a little, and he leaned his back on a bank of earth, not thinking that it was a place that was said to be a rath of the Good People. He sat there for a long time, and at last he began to hear music. It was very soft at first, and he had to listen hard to catch it at all. Then it sounded clearer, and after a little he could tell that there were fiddlers and pipers. Then he thought that he could hear the feet of dancers, and finally singers, and he could hear the words of the song that they sang. And these were the words:“And there were no other words but these, and these the singers sang over and over and over again. And all they mean is, ‘Monday, Tuesday, Monday, Tuesday, Monday, Tuesday.’ After the singers had sung these words they would make a little pause and then they would go on with them. Lusmore knew now that the music came from inside the rath, and he knew well enough that it was the Good People he was listening to. He kept very quiet and listened, and it seemed a wonderfully sweet song to him, only after a while he got tired of hearing no other words. And he thought: ‘Maybe they’d like the song better themselves if there was more of it, and I wonder couldn’t I help them with it.’“But he knew he must not disturb the Good People, so he waited till one of the little pauses, and then he sang very softly: ‘Augus da Cadine.’“Then he kept on singing all the words, along with the singers inside the rath, adding on his own new line every time:“And that means: ‘Monday, Tuesday, Monday, Tuesday, Monday, Tuesday, and Wednesday too.’“As he went on he sang a little louder and a little louder, till by and by the Good People in the rath began to listen to hear who or what it was that was singing their song with them, and then they caught the line that Lusmore had added. Then they were so pleased that they scarcely knew what to do, for they were more tired of the song than he was, only they did not know what to do to make it any better. And when they found it was somebody outside the rath that was singing it and was making more out of it than they ever did, they wanted to have him inside as soon as possible.“So all at once Lusmore saw a door open in the rath, close beside him, and a great light streaming out, and then there was the sound of wings all around him, and next he saw the forms of the Good People pouring out and flying and whirling around him like a swarm of butterflies. They caught him up and carried him inside the rath, so lightly that he could not tell what was holding him, and he felt as if he was floating in the air. He was a little frightened at first, but when they had him inside the rath they set him up above all the musicians and thanked him for mending their song, and did him all sorts of honor.“Then he saw some of the Good People talking together in a little group, and presently they came up to him, and one of them said: ‘Lusmore, we’ve been thinking what will we do for you as a reward for mending our song, and we’ve decided to ask yourself what it is that you’ld rather we’ld give you. Think, now, what it is that you’ld rather have than anything else in the world.’“‘It’s obliged to you I am for your kindness, gentlemen,’ said Lusmore, ‘but if you’ld do what would please me most in all the world, it’s not giving me anything you’ld be, but taking something from me, and that’s this hump that I have on my back.’“‘That’s easy done,’ said the one of them that had spoken before; ‘come on now and dance with us.’“Well, Lusmore, being crooked the way he was, and always weak, had never danced before in his life, and he never thought he could; but when they took hold of him on both sides and led him out, he found that he was dancing with the best of them, and he felt so light and he moved so easily that it seemed to him as if he was no more than a feather that the wind was blowing about. Then one of the Good People said to him, ‘Lusmore, where is your hump now?’“And he felt behind him for it, and it was not on his back at all. ‘Look down on the floor,’ said the one that had spoken to him, again. And he looked down, and there was his hump, lying on the floor before him.“Then they all began dancing again and Lusmore with them, till he felt tired and then dizzy, and then he fell to the ground, and he knew nothing more till he awoke in the morning and found himself lying on the ground outside the rath, where he had sat down to rest the night before. The first thing he thought was that it was a dream that he had had, but he never had felt so well and so strong in his life as he did that minute. So he put his hand behind him, and there was no hump there. And, what was more, he had on a new suit of clothes that the Good People had given him. Then he went home and told his neighbors what had happened to him, and they could scarcely believe it. But everyone knew that there were Good People in that rath, and there was himself, too, the same boy as before, only without the hump, and so, at long last, they had to believe the whole story.“Well, the news of Lusmore’s wonderful cure was told all through the country, and at last it came to a place a long way off, where there was another boy lived that had a hump on his back. And a different sort of boy he was from Lusmore. His temper was as bad as his body. He was ill-natured and spiteful and lazy, and he would always rather be making trouble than saving it. So when his mother heard the way Lusmore had had the hump taken off him, she thought maybe her boy could get rid of his own in the same way.“With that she set off with the boy and a neighbor of hers, and they came to where Lusmore lived, and asked him would he tell them all about how it was that he had the hump taken off him. And he went over it all with them and told them everything that he did and everything that happened to him. And in the end he went with them to show them the very spot where he had sat down beside the rath, and there they left the little hunchback, and told him to do everything just as Lusmore had done it.“He sat there listening for a long time and heard nothing, and so at last he went to sleep, and then all at once he was awakened by hearing the Good People singing in the rath. And they were singing much better now than when Lusmore heard them first, for they had the song now as he had improved it for them, and they were singing:“And as soon as he heard it the little fellow, not waiting for time or tune, shouted out: ‘Augus da Hena.’ And if it was all put together right that would make it mean: ‘Monday, Tuesday, Monday, Tuesday, Monday, Tuesday, and Wednesday too, and Thursday too.’ Only he didn’t trouble to put it together right, but just bawled it out any way.“Then the music stopped all at once, and he heard the people inside the rath shouting: ‘Who is spoiling our tune? Who is spoiling our tune?’ and out they all came and caught him up and hurried him inside the rath so that the breath nearly went out of his body. And one of them shouted: ‘What shall we do to him for spoiling our tune?’ and another said: ‘Ask him what he wants us to do for him!’ and another said: ‘What do you want from us, anyway?’“And he just found breath enough to say: ‘I want the same that Lusmore had,’ meaning by that he wanted them to reward him the same way they did Lusmore.“But one of the Good People shouted: ‘You’ll get what Lusmore had, then; it was a hump on the back that Lusmore had, and we took it off him, but we don’t want it and it’s easy to give it to you. Be lively there now, some of you, and hand that hump down here.’“And then some of the Good People got Lusmore’s hump, that was hanging up under the roof, and they clapped it on his back, on the top of his own, and then they threw him out of the rath. And there his mother found him in the morning, more dead than alive and with a hump twice as big as before.”“A fine story that is, Mrs. O’Brien,” Terence said, when the old woman had finished. “And why didn’t the one of them get the same reward as the other? Sure he did the same as the other in lengthening the song for the fairies, didn’t he?”“He did the same in a way,” Mrs. O’Brien answered, “but not for the same reason. Lusmore helped them with the song because he thought they might be the better for his help, and that was all the reason. And he did it in a way that wouldn’t disturb them. But the other did it only to help himself, because he thought that he’ld get a great reward for it, and he had no real wish to do them any kindness. Don’t you see the difference between the two of them?”“Stuff!” said Terence.","['chapter', 'skip', 'want', 'really', 'advise', 'nothing', 'importance', 'happen', 'next', 'eighteen', 'year', 'course',

995,irish,The Remarkable Rocket,"The King’s son was going to be married, so there were general rejoicings.  He had waited a whole year for his bride, and at last she had arrived.  She was a Russian Princess, and had driven all the way from Finland in a sledge drawn by six reindeer.  The sledge was shaped like a great golden swan, and between the swan’s wings lay the little Princess herself.  Her long ermine-cloak reached right down to her feet, on her head was a tiny cap of silver tissue, and she was as pale as the Snow Palace in which she had always lived.  So pale was she that as she drove through the streets all the people wondered.  “She is like a white rose!” they cried, and they threw down flowers on her from the balconies.At the gate of the Castle the Prince was waiting to receive her.  He had dreamy violet eyes, and his hair was like fine gold.  When he saw her he sank upon one knee, and kissed her hand.“Your picture was beautiful,” he murmured, “but you are more beautiful than your picture”; and the little Princess blushed.“She was like a white rose before,” said a young Page to his neighbour, “but she is like a red rose now”; and the whole Court was delighted.For the next three days everybody went about saying, “White rose, Red rose, Red rose, White rose”; and the King gave orders that the Page’s salary was to be doubled.  As he received no salary at all this was not of much use to him, but it was considered a great honour, and was duly published in the Court Gazette.When the three days were over the marriage was celebrated.  It was a magnificent ceremony, and the bride and bridegroom walked hand in hand under a canopy of purple velvet embroidered with little pearls.  Then there was a State Banquet, which lasted for five hours.  The Prince and Princess sat at the top of the Great Hall and drank out of a cup of clear crystal.  Only true lovers could drink out of this cup, for if false lips touched it, it grew grey and dull and cloudy.“It’s quite clear that they love each other,” said the little Page, “as clear as crystal!” and the King doubled his salary a second time.  “What an honour!” cried all the courtiers.After the banquet there was to be a Ball.  The bride and bridegroom were to dance the Rose-dance together, and the King had promised to play the flute.  He played very badly, but no one had ever dared to tell him so, because he was the King.  Indeed, he knew only two airs, and was never quite certain which one he was playing; but it made no matter, for, whatever he did, everybody cried out, “Charming! charming!”The last item on the programme was a grand display of fireworks, to be let off exactly at midnight.  The little Princess had never seen a firework in her life, so the King had given orders that the Royal Pyrotechnist should be in attendance on the day of her marriage.“What are fireworks like?” she had asked the Prince, one morning, as she was walking on the terrace.“They are like the Aurora Borealis,” said the King, who always answered questions that were addressed to other people, “only much more natural.  I prefer them to stars myself, as you always know when they are going to appear, and they are as delightful as my own flute-playing.  You must certainly see them.”So at the end of the King’s garden a great stand had been set up, and as soon as the Royal Pyrotechnist had put everything in its proper place, the fireworks began to talk to each other.“The world is certainly very beautiful,” cried a little Squib.  “Just look at those yellow tulips.  Why! if they were real crackers they could not be lovelier.  I am very glad I have travelled.  Travel improves the mind wonderfully, and does away with all one’s prejudices.”“The King’s garden is not the world, you foolish squib,” said a big Roman Candle; “the world is an enormous place, and it would take you three days to see it thoroughly.”“Any place you love is the world to you,” exclaimed a pensive Catherine Wheel, who had been attached to an old deal box in early life, and prided herself on her broken heart; “but love is not fashionable any more, the poets have killed it.  They wrote so much about it that nobody believed them, and I am not surprised.  True love suffers, and is silent.  I remember myself once—But it is no matter now.  Romance is a thing of the past.”“Nonsense!” said the Roman Candle, “Romance never dies.  It is like the moon, and lives for ever.  The bride and bridegroom, for instance, love each other very dearly.  I heard all about them this morning from a brown-paper cartridge, who happened to be staying in the same drawer as myself, and knew the latest Court news.”But the Catherine Wheel shook her head.  “Romance is dead, Romance is dead, Romance is dead,” she murmured.  She was one of those people who think that, if you say the same thing over and over a great many times, it becomes true in the end.Suddenly, a sharp, dry cough was heard, and they all looked round.It came from a tall, supercilious-looking Rocket, who was tied to the end of a long stick.  He always coughed before he made any observation, so as to attract attention.“Ahem! ahem!” he said, and everybody listened except the poor Catherine Wheel, who was still shaking her head, and murmuring, “Romance is dead.”“Order! order!” cried out a Cracker.  He was something of a politician, and had always taken a prominent part in the local elections, so he knew the proper Parliamentary expressions to use.“Quite dead,” whispered the Catherine Wheel, and she went off to sleep.As soon as there was perfect silence, the Rocket coughed a third time and began.  He spoke with a very slow, distinct voice, as if he was dictating his memoirs, and always looked over the shoulder of the person to whom he was talking.  In fact, he had a most distinguished manner.“How fortunate it is for the King’s son,” he remarked, “that he is to be married on the very day on which I am to be let off.  Really, if it had been arranged beforehand, it could not have turned out better for him; but, Princes are always lucky.”“Dear me!” said the little Squib, “I thought it was quite the other way, and that we were to be let off in the Prince’s honour.”“It may be so with you,” he answered; “indeed, I have no doubt that it is, but with me it is different.  I am a very remarkable Rocket, and come of remarkable parents.  My mother was the most celebrated Catherine Wheel of her day, and was renowned for her graceful dancing.  When she made her great public appearance she spun round nineteen times before she went out, and each time that she did so she threw into the air seven pink stars.  She was three feet and a half in diameter, and made of the very best gunpowder.  My father was a Rocket like myself, and of French extraction.  He flew so high that the people were afraid that he would never come down again.  He did, though, for he was of a kindly disposition, and he made a most brilliant descent in a shower of golden rain.  The newspapers wrote about his performance in very flattering terms.  Indeed, the Court Gazette called him a triumph of Pylotechnic art.”“Pyrotechnic, Pyrotechnic, you mean,” said a Bengal Light; “I know it is Pyrotechnic, for I saw it written on my own canister.”“Well, I said Pylotechnic,” answered the Rocket, in a severe tone of voice, and the Bengal Light felt so crushed that he began at once to bully the little squibs, in order to show that he was still a person of some importance.“I was saying,” continued the Rocket, “I was saying—What was I saying?”“You were talking about yourself,” replied the Roman Candle.“Of course; I knew I was discussing some interesting subject when I was so rudely interrupted.  I hate rudeness and bad manners of every kind, for I am extremely sensitive.  No one in the whole world is so sensitive as I am, I am quite sure of that.”“What is a sensitive person?” said the Cracker to the Roman Candle.“A person who, because he has corns himself, always treads on other people’s toes,” answered the Roman Candle in a low whisper; and the Cracker nearly exploded with laughter.“Pray, what are you laughing at?” inquired the Rocket; “I am not laughing.”“I am laughing because I am happy,” replied the Cracker.“That is a very selfish reason,” said the Rocket angrily.  “What right have you to be happy?  You should be thinking about others.  In fact, you should be thinking about me.  I am always thinking about myself, and I expect everybody else to do the same.  That is what is called sympathy.  It is a beautiful virtue, and I possess it in a high degree.  Suppose, for instance, anything happened to me to-night, what a misfortune that would be for every one!  The Prince and Princess would never be happy again, their whole married life would be spoiled; and as for the King, I know he would not get over it.  Really, when I begin to reflect on the importance of my position, I am almost moved to tears.”“If you want to give pleasure to others,” cried the Roman Candle, “you had better keep yourself dry.”“Certainly,” exclaimed the Bengal Light, who was now in better spirits; “that is only common sense.”“Common sense, indeed!” said the Rocket indignantly; “you forget that I am very uncommon, and very remarkable.  Why, anybody can have common sense, provided that they have no imagination.  But I have imagination, for I never think of things as they really are; I always think of them as being quite different.  As for keeping myself dry, there is evidently no one here who can at all appreciate an emotional nature.  Fortunately for myself, I don’t care.  The only thing that sustains one through life is the consciousness of the immense inferiority of everybody else, and this is a feeling that I have always cultivated.  But none of you have any hearts.  Here you are laughing and making merry just as if the Prince and Princess had not just been married.”“Well, really,” exclaimed a small Fire-balloon, “why not?  It is a most joyful occasion, and when I soar up into the air I intend to tell the stars all about it.  You will see them twinkle when I talk to them about the pretty bride.”“Ah! what a trivial view of life!” said the Rocket; “but it is only what I expected.  There is nothing in you; you are hollow and empty.  Why, perhaps the Prince and Princess may go to live in a country where there is a deep river, and perhaps they may have one only son, a little fair-haired boy with violet eyes like the Prince himself; and perhaps some day he may go out to walk with his nurse; and perhaps the nurse may go to sleep under a great elder-tree; and perhaps the little boy may fall into the deep river and be drowned.  What a terrible misfortune!  Poor people, to lose their only son!  It is really too dreadful!  I shall never get over it.”“But they have not lost their only son,” said the Roman Candle; “no misfortune has happened to them at all.”“I never said that they had,” replied the Rocket; “I said that they might.  If they had lost their only son there would be no use in saying anything more about the matter.  I hate people who cry over spilt milk.  But when I think that they might lose their only son, I certainly am very much affected.”“You certainly are!” cried the Bengal Light.  “In fact, you are the most affected person I ever met.”“You are the rudest person I ever met,” said the Rocket, “and you cannot understand my friendship for the Prince.”“Why, you don’t even know him,” growled the Roman Candle.“I never said I knew him,” answered the Rocket.  “I dare say that if I knew him I should not be his friend at all.  It is a very dangerous thing to know one’s friends.”“You had really better keep yourself dry,” said the Fire-balloon.  “That is the important thing.”“Very important for you, I have no doubt,” answered the Rocket, “but I shall weep if I choose”; and he actually burst into real tears, which flowed down his stick like rain-drops, and nearly drowned two little beetles, who were just thinking of setting up house together, and were looking for a nice dry spot to live in.“He must have a truly romantic nature,” said the Catherine Wheel, “for he weeps when there is nothing at all to weep about”; and she heaved a deep sigh, and thought about the deal box.But the Roman Candle and the Bengal Light were quite indignant, and kept saying, “Humbug! humbug!” at the top of their voices.  They were extremely practical, and whenever they objected to anything they called it humbug.Then the moon rose like a wonderful silver shield; and the stars began to shine, and a sound of music came from the palace.The Prince and Princess were leading the dance.  They danced so beautifully that the tall white lilies peeped in at the window and watched them, and the great red poppies nodded their heads and beat time.Then ten o’clock struck, and then eleven, and then twelve, and at the last stroke of midnight every one came out on the terrace, and the King sent for the Royal Pyrotechnist.“Let the fireworks begin,” said the King; and the Royal Pyrotechnist made a low bow, and marched down to the end of the garden.  He had six attendants with him, each of whom carried a lighted torch at the end of a long pole.It was certainly a magnificent display.Whizz! Whizz! went the Catherine Wheel, as she spun round and round.  Boom!  Boom! went the Roman Candle.  Then the Squibs danced all over the place, and the Bengal Lights made everything look scarlet.  “Good-bye,” cried the Fire-balloon, as he soared away, dropping tiny blue sparks.  Bang! Bang! answered the Crackers, who were enjoying themselves immensely.  Every one was a great success except the Remarkable Rocket.  He was so damp with crying that he could not go off at all.  The best thing in him was the gunpowder, and that was so wet with tears that it was of no use.  All his poor relations, to whom he would never speak, except with a sneer, shot up into the sky like wonderful golden flowers with blossoms of fire.  Huzza! Huzza! cried the Court; and the little Princess laughed with pleasure.“I suppose they are reserving me for some grand occasion,” said the Rocket; “no doubt that is what it means,” and he looked more supercilious than ever.The next day the workmen came to put everything tidy.  “This is evidently a deputation,” said the Rocket; “I will receive them with becoming dignity” so he put his nose in the air, and began to frown severely as if he were thinking about some very important subject.  But they took no notice of him at all till they were just going away.  Then one of them caught sight of him.  “Hallo!” he cried, “what a bad rocket!” and he threw him over the wall into the ditch.“Bad Rocket?  Bad Rocket?” he said, as he whirled through the air; “impossible!  Grand Rocket, that is what the man said.  Bad and Grand sound very much the same, indeed they often are the same”; and he fell into the mud.“It is not comfortable here,” he remarked, “but no doubt it is some fashionable watering-place, and they have sent me away to recruit my health.  My nerves are certainly very much shattered, and I require rest.”Then a little Frog, with bright jewelled eyes, and a green mottled coat, swam up to him.“A new arrival, I see!” said the Frog.  “Well, after all there is nothing like mud.  Give me rainy weather and a ditch, and I am quite happy.  Do you think it will be a wet afternoon?  I am sure I hope so, but the sky is quite blue and cloudless.  What a pity!”“Ahem! ahem!” said the Rocket, and he began to cough.“What a delightful voice you have!” cried the Frog.  “Really it is quite like a croak, and croaking is of course the most musical sound in the world.  You will hear our glee-club this evening.  We sit in the old duck pond close by the farmer’s house, and as soon as the moon rises we begin.  It is so entrancing that everybody lies awake to listen to us.  In fact, it was only yesterday that I heard the farmer’s wife say to her mother that she could not get a wink of sleep at night on account of us.  It is most gratifying to find oneself so popular.”“Ahem! ahem!” said the Rocket angrily.  He was very much annoyed that he could not get a word in.“A delightful voice, certainly,” continued the Frog; “I hope you will come over to the duck-pond.  I am off to look for my daughters.  I have six beautiful daughters, and I am so afraid the Pike may meet them.  He is a perfect monster, and would have no hesitation in breakfasting off them.  Well, good-bye: I have enjoyed our conversation very much, I assure you.”“Conversation, indeed!” said the Rocket.  “You have talked the whole time yourself.  That is not conversation.”“Somebody must listen,” answered the Frog, “and I like to do all the talking myself.  It saves time, and prevents arguments.”“But I like arguments,” said the Rocket.“I hope not,” said the Frog complacently.  “Arguments are extremely vulgar, for everybody in good society holds exactly the same opinions.  Good-bye a second time; I see my daughters in the distance and the little Frog swam away.“You are a very irritating person,” said the Rocket, “and very ill-bred.  I hate people who talk about themselves, as you do, when one wants to talk about oneself, as I do.  It is what I call selfishness, and selfishness is a most detestable thing, especially to any one of my temperament, for I am well known for my sympathetic nature.  In fact, you should take example by me; you could not possibly have a better model.  Now that you have the chance you had better avail yourself of it, for I am going back to Court almost immediately.  I am a great favourite at Court; in fact, the Prince and Princess were married yesterday in my honour.  Of course you know nothing of these matters, for you are a provincial.”“There is no good talking to him,” said a Dragon-fly, who was sitting on the top of a large brown bulrush; “no good at all, for he has gone away.”“Well, that is his loss, not mine,” answered the Rocket.  “I am not going to stop talking to him merely because he pays no attention.  I like hearing myself talk.  It is one of my greatest pleasures.  I often have long conversations all by myself, and I am so clever that sometimes I don’t understand a single word of what I am saying.”“Then you should certainly lecture on Philosophy,” said the Dragon-fly; and he spread a pair of lovely gauze wings and soared away into the sky.“How very silly of him not to stay here!” said the Rocket.  “I am sure that he has not often got such a chance of improving his mind.  However, I don’t care a bit.  Genius like mine is sure to be appreciated some day”; and he sank down a little deeper into the mud.After some time a large White Duck swam up to him.  She had yellow legs, and webbed feet, and was considered a great beauty on account of her waddle.“Quack, quack, quack,” she said.  “What a curious shape you are!  May I ask were you born like that, or is it the result of an accident?”“It is quite evident that you have always lived in the country,” answered the Rocket, “otherwise you would know who I am.  However, I excuse your ignorance.  It would be unfair to expect other people to be as remarkable as oneself.  You will no doubt be surprised to hear that I can fly up into the sky, and come down in a shower of golden rain.”“I don’t think much of that,” said the Duck, “as I cannot see what use it is to any one.  Now, if you could plough the fields like the ox, or draw a cart like the horse, or look after the sheep like the collie-dog, that would be something.”“My good creature,” cried the Rocket in a very haughty tone of voice, “I see that you belong to the lower orders.  A person of my position is never useful.  We have certain accomplishments, and that is more than sufficient.  I have no sympathy myself with industry of any kind, least of all with such industries as you seem to recommend.  Indeed, I have always been of opinion that hard work is simply the refuge of people who have nothing whatever to do.”“Well, well,” said the Duck, who was of a very peaceable disposition, and never quarrelled with any one, “everybody has different tastes.  I hope, at any rate, that you are going to take up your residence here.”“Oh! dear no,” cried the Rocket.  “I am merely a visitor, a distinguished visitor.  The fact is that I find this place rather tedious.  There is neither society here, nor solitude.  In fact, it is essentially suburban.  I shall probably go back to Court, for I know that I am destined to make a sensation in the world.”“I had thoughts of entering public life once myself,” remarked the Duck; “there are so many things that need reforming.  Indeed, I took the chair at a meeting some time ago, and we passed resolutions condemning everything that we did not like.  However, they did not seem to have much effect.  Now I go in for domesticity, and look after my family.”“I am made for public life,” said the Rocket, “and so are all my relations, even the humblest of them.  Whenever we appear we excite great attention.  I have not actually appeared myself, but when I do so it will be a magnificent sight.  As for domesticity, it ages one rapidly, and distracts one’s mind from higher things.”“Ah! the higher things of life, how fine they are!” said the Duck; “and that reminds me how hungry I feel”: and she swam away down the stream, saying, “Quack, quack, quack.”“Come back! come back!” screamed the Rocket, “I have a great deal to say to you”; but the Duck paid no attention to him.  “I am glad that she has gone,” he said to himself, “she has a decidedly middle-class mind”; and he sank a little deeper still into the mud, and began to think about the loneliness of genius, when suddenly two little boys in white smocks came running down the bank, with a kettle and some faggots.“This must be the deputation,” said the Rocket, and he tried to look very dignified.“Hallo!” cried one of the boys, “look at this old stick!  I wonder how it came here”; and he picked the rocket out of the ditch.“Old Stick!” said the Rocket, “impossible!  Gold Stick, that is what he said.  Gold Stick is very complimentary.  In fact, he mistakes me for one of the Court dignitaries!”“Let us put it into the fire!” said the other boy, “it will help to boil the kettle.”So they piled the faggots together, and put the Rocket on top, and lit the fire.“This is magnificent,” cried the Rocket, “they are going to let me off in broad day-light, so that every one can see me.”“We will go to sleep now,” they said, “and when we wake up the kettle will be boiled”; and they lay down on the grass, and shut their eyes.The Rocket was very damp, so he took a long time to burn.  At last, however, the fire caught him.“Now I am going off!” he cried, and he made himself very stiff and straight.  “I know I shall go much higher than the stars, much higher than the moon, much higher than the sun.  In fact, I shall go so high that—”Fizz! Fizz! Fizz! and he went straight up into the air.“Delightful!” he cried, “I shall go on like this for ever.  What a success I am!”But nobody saw him.Then he began to feel a curious tingling sensation all over him.“Now I am going to explode,” he cried.  “I shall set the whole world on fire, and make such a noise that nobody will talk about anything else for a whole year.”  And he certainly did explode.  Bang! Bang! Bang! went the gunpowder.  There was no doubt about it.But nobody heard him, not even the two little boys, for they were sound asleep.Then all that was left of him was the stick, and this fell down on the back of a Goose who was taking a walk by the side of the ditch.“Good heavens!” cried the Goose.  “It is going to rain sticks”; and she rushed into the water.“I knew I should create a great sensation,” gasped the Rocket, and he went out.","['king', 'married', 'general', 'rejoicing', 'wait', 'whole', 'year', 'bride', 'last', 'arrive', 'russian', 'princess', 'driven', 'finland', 'sledge',

996,irish,Fairies or No Fairies,"John Mulligan was as fine an old fellow as ever threw a Carlow spur into the sides of a horse. He was, besides, as jolly a boon companion over a jug of punch as you would meet from Carnsore Point to Bloody Farland. And a good horse he used to ride; and a stiffer jug of punch than his was not in nineteen baronies. May be he stuck more to it than he ought to have done-but that is nothing whatever to the story I am going to tell.John believed devoutly in fairies; and an angry man was he if you doubted them. He had more fairy stories than would make, if properly printed in a rivulet of print running down a meadow of margin, two thick quartos for Mr. Murray, of Albemarle street; all of which he used to tell on all occasions that he could find listeners. Many believed his stories – many more did not believe them – but nobody, in process of time, used to contradict the old gentleman, for it was a pity to vex him. But he had a couple of young neighbours who were just come down from their first vacation in Trinity College to spend the summer months with an uncle of theirs, Mr. Whaley, an old Cromwellian, who lived at Ballybegmullinahone, and they were too full of logic to let the old man have his own way undisputed.Every story he told they laughed at, and said that it was impossible – that it was merely old woman’s gabble, and other such things. When he would insist that all his stories were derived from the most credible sources – nay, that some of them had been told him by his own grandmother, a very respectable old lady, but slightly affected in her faculties, as things that came under her own knowledge – they cut the matter short by declaring that she was in her dotage, and at the best of times had a strong propensity to pulling a long bow.“But,” said they, “Jack Mulligan, did you ever see a fairy yourself?”“Never,” was the reply. – Never, as I am a man of honour and credit.”“Well, then,” they answered, ” until you do, do not be bothering us with any more tales of my grandmother.”Jack was particularly nettled at this, and took up the: cudgels for his grandmother; but the younkers were too sharp for him, and finally he got into a passion, as people generally do who have the worst of an argument. This evening – it was at their uncle’s, an old crony of his with whom he had dined – he bad taken a large portion of his usual beverage, and was quite riotous. He at last got up in a passion, ordered his horse, and, in spite of his host’s entreaties, galloped off, although he had intended to have slept there, declaring that he would not have any thing more to do with a pair of jackanapes puppies, who, because they had learned how to read good-for-nothing hooks in cramp writing, and were taught by a parcel of wiggy, red-snouted, prating prigs, (“not,” added he, “however, that I say a man may not be a good man and have a red nose,”) they imagined they knew more than a man who had held buckle and tongue together facing the wind of the world for five dozen years.He rode off in a fret, and galloped as hard as his horse Shaunbuie could powder away over the limestone. ” Damn it!” hiccupped he, ” Lord pardon me for swearing! the brats had me in one thing – I never did see a fairy; and I would give up five as good acres as ever grew apple-potatoes to get a glimpse of one – and, by the powers! what is that?”He looked, and saw a gallant spectacle. His road lay by a noble demesne, gracefully sprinkled with trees, not thickly planted as in a dark forest, but disposed, now in clumps of five or six, now standing singly, towering over the plain of verdure around them, as a beautiful promontory arising out of the sea. He had come right opposite the glory of the wood. It was an oak, which in the oldest title-deeds of the county, and they were at least five hundred years old, was called the old oak of Ballinghassig. Age had hollowed its centre, but its massy boughs still waved with their dark serrated foliage. The moon was shining on it bright. If I were a poet, like Mr. Wordsworth, I should tell you how the beautiful light was broken into a thousand different fragments – and how it. filled the entire tree with a glorious flood, bathing every particular leaf, and showing forth every particular bough; but, as I am not a poet, I shall go on with my story. By this light Jack saw a, brilliant company of lovely little forms dancing under the oak with an unsteady and rolling motion. The company was large. Some spread out far beyond the furthest boundary of the shadow of the oak’s branches – some were seen glancing through the flashes of light shining through its leaves – some were barely visible, nestling under the trunk – some no doubt were entirely concealed from his eyes. Never did man see any thing more beautiful. They were not three inches in height, but they were white as the driven snow, and beyond number numberless. Jack threw the bridle over his horse’s neck, and drew up to the low wall which bounded the demesne, and leaning over it, surveyed, with infinite delight, their diversified gambols. By looking long at them, he soon saw objects which had not struck him at first; in particular that in the middle was a chief of superior stature, round whom the group appeared to move. He gazed so long that he was quite overcome with joy, and could not help shouting out, ” Bravo! little fellow,” said he, well kicked and strong.” But the instant he uttered the words the night was darkened, and the fairies vanished with the speed of lightning.” I wish,” said Jack, “I had held my tongue; but no matter now. I shall just turn bridle about and go back to Ballybegmullinahone Castle, and beat the young Master Whaleys, fine reasoners as they think themselves, out of the field clean.”No sooner said than done; and Jack was back again as if upon the wings of the wind. He rapped fiercely at the door, and called aloud for the two collegians.” Hallo!” said he, “young Flatcaps, come down now, if you dare. Come down, if you dare, and I shall give you oc-oc-ocular demonstration of the truth of what I was saying.”Old Whaley put his head out of the window, and said, “Jack Mulligan, what brings you back so soon?”“The fairies,” shouted Jack; “the fairies!”I am afraid,” muttered the Lord of Ballybegmullinahone, ” the last glass you took was too little watered: but, no matter – come in and cool yourself over a tumbler of punch.”He came in and sat down again at table. In great spirits he told his story ; – how he had seen thousands and tens of thousands of fairies dancing about the old oak of Balllinghassig; he described their beautiful dresses of shining silver; their flat-crowned hats, glittering in the moonbeams; the princely stature and demeanour of the central figure. He added, that he heard them singing, and playing the most enchanting music; but this was merely imagination. The young men laughed, but Jack held his ground. “Suppose, said one of the lads, ” we join company with you on the road, and ride along to the place, where you saw that fine company of fairies?”“Done!” cried Jack; “but I will not promise that you will find them there, for I saw them scudding up in the sky like a flight of bees, and heard their wings whizzing through the air.” This, you know, was a bounce, for Jack had heard no such thing.Off rode the three, and came to the demesne of Oakwood. They arrived at the wall flanking the field where stood the great oak; and the moon, by this time, having again emerged from the clouds, shone bright as when Jack had passed. “Look there,” he cried, exultingly; for the same spectacle again caught his eyes, and he pointed to it with his horsewhip; ” look, and deny if you can. ”“Why,” said one of the lads, pausing, ” true it is that we do see a company of white creatures; but were they fairies ten time~ over, I shall go among them;” and he dismounted to climb over the wall.“Ah, Tom Tom;” cried Jack, ” stop, man, stop! what are you doing? The fairies – the good people, I mean – hate to be meddled with. You will be pinched or bIinded; or your horse will cast its shoe; or – look! a wilful man will have his way. Oh! oh! he is almost at the oak – God help him! for he is past the help of man.”By this time Tom was under the tree and burst out laughing. “Jack,” said he, “keep your prayers to yourself. Your fairies are not bad at all. I believe they will make tolerably good catsup.”Catsup,” said Jack, who when he found that the two lads (for the second had followed his brother) were both laughing in the middle of the fairies, had dismounted and advanced slowly -What do you mean by catsup?”“Nothing,” replied Tom, ” but that they are mushrooms (as indeed they were); and your Oberon is merely this overgrown puff-ball.”Poor Mulligan gave a long whistle of amazement, staggered back to his horse without saying a word, and rode home in a hard gallop, never looking behind him. Many a long day was it before he ventured to face the laughers at Ballybegmullinahone; and to the day of his death the people of the parish, aye, and five parishes round, called him nothing but Musharoon Jack, such being their pronunciation of mushroom.I should be sorry if all my fairy stories ended with so little dignity; but –“These our actors,As I foretold you, were all spirits, andAre melted into air – into thin air.”","['john', 'mulligan', 'fine', 'fellow', 'ever', 'threw', 'carlow', 'spur', 'side', 'horse', 'besides', 'jolly', 'boon', 'companion', 'punch', 'would', 'meet',

1045,irish,"Black, Brown and Gray","In a day Fin MacCumhail was near Tara of the Kings, south of Ballyshannon, hunting with seven companies of the Fenians of Erin.During the day they saw three strange men coming towards them, and Fin said to the Fenians: “Let none of you speak to them, and if they have good manners they’ll not speak to you nor to any man till they come to me.”When the three men came up, they said nothing till they stood before Fin himself. Then he asked what their names were and what they wanted. They answered:—Fin was so well pleased with their looks that he brought them home with him that evening and called them his sons. Then he said, “Every man who comes to this castle must watch the first night for me, and since three of you have come together, each will watch one third of the night. You’ll cast lots to see who’ll watch first and second.”Fin had the trunk of a tree brought, three equal parts made of it, and one given to each of the men.Then he said, “When each of you begins his watch he will set fire to his own piece of wood, and so long as the wood burns he will watch.”The lot fell to Dubh to go on the first watch. Dubh set fire to his log, then went out around the castle, the dog Bran with him. He wandered on, going further and further from the castle, and Bran after him. At last he saw a bright light and went towards it. When he came to the place where the light was burning, he saw a large house. He entered the house and when inside saw a great company of most strange looking men, drinking out of a single cup.The chief of the party, who was sitting on a high place, gave the cup to the man nearest him; and when he had drunk his fill out of it, he passed it to his neighbor, and so on to the last.While the cup was going the round of the company, the chief said, “This is the great cup that was taken from Fin MacCumhail a hundred years ago; and as much as each man wishes to drink he always gets from it, and no matter how many men there may be, or what they wish for, they always have their fill.”Dubh sat near the door on the edge of the crowd, and when the cup came to him he drank a little, then slipped out and hurried away in the dark; when he came to the fountain at the castle of Fin MacCumhail, his log was burned.As the second lot had fallen on Dun, it was now his turn to watch, so he set fire to his log and went out, in the place of Dubh, with the dog Bran after him.Dun walked on through the night till he saw a fire. He went towards it, and when he had come near he saw a large house, which he entered; and when inside he saw a crowd of strange looking men, fighting. They were ferocious, wonderful to look at, and fighting wildly.The chief, who had climbed on the crossbeams of the house to escape the uproar and struggle, called out to the crowd below: “Stop fighting now; for I have a better gift than the one you have lost this night.” And putting his hand behind his belt, he drew out a knife and held it before them, saying: “Here is the wonderful knife, the small knife of division, that was stolen from Fin MacCumhail a hundred years ago, and if you cut on a bone with the knife, you’ll get the finest meat in the world, and as much of it as ever your hearts can wish for.”Then he passed down the knife and a bare bone to the man next him, and the man began to cut; and off came slices of the sweetest and best meat in the world.The knife and the bone passed from man to man till they came to Dun, who cut a slice off the bone, slipped out unseen, and made for Fin’s castle as fast as his two legs could carry him through the darkness and over the ground.When he was by the fountain at the castle, his part of the log was burned and his watch at an end.Now Glasán set fire to his stick of wood and went out on his watch and walked forward till he saw the light and came to the same house that Dubh and Dun had visited. Looking in he saw the place full of dead bodies, and thought, “There must be some great wonder here. If I lie down in the midst of these and put some of them over me to hide myself, I shall be able to see what is going on.”He lay down and pulled some of the bodies over himself. He wasn’t there long when he saw an old hag coming into the house. She had but one leg, one arm, and one upper tooth, which was as long as her leg and served her in place of a crutch. When inside the door she took up the first corpse she met and threw it aside; it was lean. As she went on she took two bites out of every fat corpse she met, and threw every lean one aside.She had her fill of flesh and blood before she came to Glasán; and as soon as she had that, she dropped down on the floor, lay on her back, and went to sleep.Every breath she drew, Glasán was afraid she’d drag the roof down on top of his head, and every time she let a breath out of her he thought she’d sweep the roof off the house.Then he rose up, looked at her, and wondered at the bulk of her body. At last he drew his sword, hit her a slash, and if he did, three young giants sprang forth.Glasán killed the first giant, the dog Bran killed the second, and the third ran away.Glasán now hurried back, and when he reached the fountain at Fin’s castle, his log of wood was burned, and day was dawning.When all had risen in the morning, and the Fenians of Erin came out, Fin said to Dubh, “Have you anything new or wonderful to tell me after the night’s watching?”“I have,” said Dubh; “for I brought back the drinking-cup that you lost a hundred years ago. I was out in the darkness watching. I walked on, and the dog Bran with me till I saw a light. When I came to the light I found a house, and in the house a company feasting. The chief was a very old man, and sat on a high place above the rest. He took out the cup and said: ‘This is the cup that was stolen from Fin MacCumhail a hundred years ago, and it is always full of the best drink in the world; and when one of you has drunk from the cup pass it on to the next.’“They drank and passed the cup till it came to me. I took it and hurried back. When I came here, my log was burned and my watch was finished. Here now is the cup for you,” said Dubh to Fin MacCumhail.Fin praised him greatly for what he had done, and turning to Dun said: “Now tell us what happened in your watch.”“When my turn came I set fire to the log which you gave me, and walked on; the dog Bran following, till I saw a light. When I came to the light, I found a house in which was a crowd of people, all fighting except one very old man on a high place above the rest. He called to them for peace, and told them to be quiet. ‘For,’ said he, ‘I have a better gift for you than the one you lost this night,’ and he took out the small knife of division with a bare bone, and said: ‘This is the knife that was stolen from Fin MacCumhail, a hundred years ago, and whenever you cut on the bone with the knife, you’ll get your fill of the best meat on earth.’“Then he handed the knife and the bone to the man nearest him, who cut from it all the meat he wanted, and then passed it to his neighbor. The knife went from hand to hand till it came to me, then I took it, slipped out, and hurried away. When I came to the fountain, my log was burned, and here are the knife and bone for you.”“You have done a great work, and deserve my best praise,” said Fin. “We are sure of the best eating and drinking as long as we keep the cup and the knife.”“Now what have you seen in your part of the night?” said Fin to Glasán.“I went out,” said Glasán, “with the dog Bran, and walked on till I saw a light, and when I came to the light I saw a house, which I entered. Inside were heaps of dead men, killed in fighting, and I wondered greatly when I saw them. At last I lay down in the midst of the corpses, put some of them over me and waited to see what would happen.“Soon an old hag came in at the door, she had but one arm, one leg, and the one tooth out of her upper jaw, and that tooth as long as her leg, and she used it for a crutch as she hobbled along. She threw aside the first corpse she met and took two bites out of the second,—for she threw every lean corpse away and took two bites out of every fat one. When she had eaten her fill, she lay down on her back in the middle of the floor and went to sleep. I rose up then to look at her, and every time she drew a breath I was in dread she would bring down the roof of the house on the top of my head, and every time she let a breath out of her, I thought she’d sweep the roof from the building, so strong was the breath of the old hag.“Then I drew my sword and cut her with a blow, but if I did three young giants sprang up before me. I killed the first, Bran killed the second, but the third escaped. I walked away then, and when I was at the fountain outside, daylight had come and my log was burned.”“Between you and me,” said Fin, “it would have been as well if you had let the old hag alone. I am greatly in dread the third young giant will bring trouble on us all.”For twenty-one years Fin MacCumhail and the Fenians of Erin hunted for sport alone. They had the best of eating from the small knife of division, and the best of drinking from the cup that was never dry. At the end of twenty-one years Dubh, Dun, and Glasán went away, and one day, as Fin and the Fenians of Erin were hunting on the hills and mountains, they saw a Fear Ruadh (a red haired man) coming toward them.“There is a bright looking man coming this way,” said Fin, “and don’t you speak to him.”“Oh, what do we care for him?” asked Conan Maol.“Don’t be rude to a stranger,” said Fin.The Fear Ruadh came forward and spoke to no man till he stood before Fin.“What have you come for?” asked Fin.“To find a master for twenty-one years.”“What wages do you ask?” inquired Fin.“No wages but this,—that if I die before the twenty-one years have passed, I shall be buried on Inis Caol (Light Island).”“I’ll give you those wages,” said Fin, and he hired the Fear Ruadh for twenty-one years.He served Fin for twenty years to his satisfaction; but toward the end of the twenty-first year he fell into a decline, became an old man, and died.When the Fear Ruadh was dead, the Fenians of Erin said that not a step would they go to bury him; but Fin declared that he wouldn’t break his word for any man, and must take the corpse to Inis Caol.Fin had an old white horse which he had turned out to find a living for himself as he could on the hillsides and in the woods. And now he looked for the horse and found that he had become younger than older in looks since he had put him out. So he took the old white horse and tied a coffin, with the body of the Fear Ruadh in it, on his back. Then they started him on ahead and away he went followed by Fin and twelve men of the Fenians of Erin.When they came to the temple on Inis Caol there were no signs of the white horse and the coffin; but the temple was open and in went Fin and the twelve.There were seats for each man inside. They sat down and rested awhile and then Fin tried to rise but couldn’t. He told the men to rise, but the twelve were fastened to the seats, and the seats to the ground, so that not a man of them could come to his feet.“Oh,” said Fin, “I’m in dread there is some evil trick played on us.”At that moment the Fear Ruadh stood before them in all his former strength and youth and said: “Now is the time for me to take satisfaction out of you for my mother and brothers,” Then one of the men said to Fin, “Chew your thumb to know is there any way out of this.”Fin chewed his thumb to know what should he do. When he knew, he blew the great whistle with his two hands; which was heard by Donogh Kamcosa and Diarmuid O’Duivne.The Fear Ruadh fell to and killed three of the men; but before he could touch the fourth Donogh and Diarmuid were there, and put an end to him. Now all were free, and Fin with the nine men went back to their castle south of Ballyshannon.","['maccumhail', 'near', 'tara', 'king', 'south', 'ballyshannon', 'hunt', 'seven', 'company', 'fenians',

1046,irish,The Brown Bear of Norway,"There was once a king in Ireland, and he had three daughters, and very nice princesses they were. And one day, when they and their father were walking on the lawn, the king began to joke with them, and to ask them whom they would like to be married to. ‘I’ll have the king of Ulster for a husband,’ says one; ‘and I’ll have the king of Munster,’ says another; ‘and,’ says the youngest, ‘I’ll have no husband but the Brown Bear of Norway.’“The brown bear.” Illustration by Joseph Martin Kronheim, published in The Child’s Picture Book of Wild and Domestic Animals by Unknown Author (1872), George Routledge and Sons.For a nurse of hers used to be telling her of an enchanted prince that she called by that name, and she fell in love with him, and his name was the first name on her tongue, for the very night before she was dreaming of him. Well, one laughed, and another laughed, and they joked with the princess all the rest of the evening. But that very night she woke up out of her sleep in a great hall that was lighted up with a thousand lamps; the richest carpets were on the floor, and the walls were covered with cloth of gold and silver, and the place was full of grand company, and the very beautiful prince she saw in her dreams was there, and it wasn’t a moment till he was on one knee before her, and telling her how much he loved her, and asking her wouldn’t she be his queen. Well, she hadn’t the heart to refuse him, and married they were the same evening.‘Now, my darling,’ says he, when they were left by themselves, ‘you must know that I am under enchantment. A sorceress, that had a beautiful daughter, wished me for her son-in-law; but the mother got power over me, and when I refused to wed her daughter she made me take the form of a bear by day, and I was to continue so till a lady would marry me of her own free will, and endure five years of great trials after.’Well, when the princess woke in the morning, she missed her husband from her side, and spent the day very sadly. But as soon as the lamps were lighted in the grand hall, where she was sitting on a sofa covered with silk, the folding doors flew open, and he was sitting by her side the next minute. So they spent another happy evening, but he warned her that whenever she began to tire of him, or ceased to have faith in him, they would be parted for ever, and he’d be obliged to marry the witch’s daughter.She got used to find him absent by day, and they spent a happy twelvemonth together, and at last a beautiful little boy was born; and happy as she was before, she was twice as happy now, for she had her child to keep her company in the day when she couldn’t see her husband.At last, one evening, when herself, and himself, and her child were sitting with a window open because it was a sultry night, in flew an eagle, took the infant’s sash in his beak, and flew up in the air with him. She screamed, and was going to throw herself out the window after him, but the prince caught her, and looked at her very seriously. She bethought of what he said soon after their marriage, and she stopped the cries and complaints that were on her tongue. She spent her days very lonely for another twelvemonth, when a beautiful little girl was sent to her. Then she thought to herself she’d have a sharp eye about her this time; so she never would allow a window to be more than a few inches open.But all her care was in vain. Another evening, when they were all so happy, and the prince dandling the baby, a beautiful greyhound stood before them, took the child out of the father’s hand, and was out of the door before you could wink. This time she shouted and ran out of the room, but there were some of the servants in the next room, and all declared that neither child nor dog passed out. She felt, somehow, as if it was her husband’s fault, but still she kept command over herself, and didn’t once reproach him.When the third child was born she would hardly allow a window or a door to be left open for a moment; but she wasn’t the nearer to keep the child to herself. They were sitting one evening by the fire, when a lady appeared standing by them. The princess opened her eyes in a great fright and stared at her, and while she was doing so, the lady wrapped a shawl round the baby that was sitting in its father’s lap, and either sank through the ground with it or went up through the wide chimney. This time the mother kept her bed for a month.‘My dear,’ said she to her husband, when she was beginning to recover, ‘I think I’d feel better if I was to see my father and mother and sisters once more. If you give me leave to go home for a few days I’d be glad.’ ‘Very well,’ said he, ‘I will do that, and whenever you feel inclined to return, only mention your wish when you lie down at night.’ The next morning when she awoke she found herself in her own old chamber in her father’s palace. She rang the bell, and in a short time she had her mother and father and married sisters about her, and they laughed till they cried for joy at finding her safe back again.In time she told them all that had happened to her, and they didn’t know what to advise her to do. She was as fond of her husband as ever, and said she was sure that he couldn’t help letting the children go; but still she was afraid beyond the world to have another child torn from her. Well, the mother and sisters consulted a wise woman that used to bring eggs to the castle, for they had great faith in her wisdom. She said the only plan was to secure the bear’s skin that the prince was obliged to put on every morning, and get it burned, and then he couldn’t help being a man night and day, and the enchantment would be at an end.So they all persuaded her to do that, and she promised she would; and after eight days she felt so great a longing to see her husband again that she made the wish the same night, and when she woke three hours after, she was in her husband’s palace, and he himself was watching over her. There was great joy on both sides, and they were happy for many days.Now she began to think how she never minded her husband leaving her in the morning, and how she never found him neglecting to give her a sweet drink out of a gold cup just as she was going to bed.One night she contrived not to drink any of it, though she pretended to do so; and she was wakeful enough in the morning, and saw her husband passing out through a panel in the wainscot, though she kept her eyelids nearly closed. The next night she got a few drops of the sleepy posset that she saved the evening before put into her husband’s night drink, and that made him sleep sound enough. She got up after midnight, passed through the panel, and found a Beautiful brown bear’s hide hanging in the corner. Then she stole back, and went down to the parlour fire, and put the hide into the middle of it till it was all fine ashes. She then lay down by her husband, gave him a kiss on the cheek, and fell asleep.If she was to live a hundred years she’d never forget how she wakened next morning, and found her husband looking down on her with misery and anger in his face. ‘Unhappy woman,’ said he, ‘you have separated us for ever! Why hadn’t you patience for five years? I am now obliged, whether I like or no, to go a three days’ journey to the witch’s castle, and marry her daughter. The skin that was my guard you have burned it, and the egg-wife that gave you the counsel was the witch herself. I won’t reproach you: your punishment will be severe without it. Farewell for ever!’He kissed her for the last time, and was off the next minute, walking as fast as he could. She shouted after him, and then seeing there was no use, she dressed herself and pursued him. He never stopped, nor stayed, nor looked back, and still she kept him in sight; and when he was on the hill she was in the hollow, and when he was in the hollow she was on the hill. Her life was almost leaving her, when, just as the sun was setting, he turned up a lane, and went into a little house. She crawled up after him, and when she got inside there was a beautiful little boy on his knees, and he kissing and hugging him. ‘Here, my poor darling,’ says he, ‘is your eldest child, and there,’ says he, pointing to a woman that was looking on with a smile on her face, ‘is the eagle that carried him away.’ She forgot all her sorrows in a moment, hugging her child, and laughing and crying over him. The woman washed their feet, and rubbed them with an ointment that took all the soreness out of their bones, and made them as fresh as a daisy. Next morning, just before sunrise, he was up, and prepared to be off, ‘Here,’ said he to her, ‘is a thing which may be of use to you. It’s a scissors, and whatever stuff you cut with it will be turned into silk. The moment the sun rises, I’ll lose all memory of yourself and the children, but I’ll get it at sunset again. Farewell!’ But he wasn’t far gone till she was in sight of him again, leaving her boy behind. It was the same to- day as yesterday: their shadows went before them in the morning and followed them in the evening. He never stopped, and she never stopped, and as the sun was setting he turned up another lane, and there they found their little daughter. It was all joy and comfort again till morning, and then the third day’s journey commenced.But before he started he gave her a comb, and told her that whenever she used it, pearls and diamonds would fall from her hair. Still he had his memory from sunset to sunrise; but from sunrise to sunset he travelled on under the charm, and never threw his eye behind. This night they came to where the youngest baby was, and the next morning, just before sunrise, the prince spoke to her for the last time. ‘Here, my poor wife,’ said he, ‘is a little hand-reel, with gold thread that has no end, and the half of our marriage ring. If you ever get to my house, and put your half-ring to mine, I shall recollect you. There is a wood yonder, and the moment I enter it I shall forget everything that ever happened between us, just as if I was born yesterday. Farewell, dear wife and child, for ever!’ Just then the sun rose, and away he walked towards the wood. She saw it open before him and close after him, and when she came up, she could no more get in than she could break through a stone wall. She wrung her hands and shed tears, but then she recollected herself, and cried out, ‘Wood, I charge you by my three magic gifts, the scissors, the comb, and the reel–to let me through’; and it opened, and she went along a walk till she came in sight of a palace, and a lawn, and a woodman’s cottage on the edge of the wood where it came nearest the palace.She went into the lodge, and asked the woodman and his wife to take her into their service. They were not willing at first; but she told them she would ask no wages, and would give them diamonds, and pearls, and silk stuffs, and gold thread whenever they wished for them, and then they agreed to let her stay.It wasn’t long till she heard how a young prince, that was just arrived, was living in the palace of the young mistress. He seldom stirred abroad, and every one that saw him remarked how silent and sorrowful he went about, like a person that was searching for some lost thing.The servants and conceited folk at the big house began to take notice of the beautiful young woman at the lodge, and to annoy her with their impudence. The head footman was the most troublesome, and at last she invited him to come and take tea with her. Oh, how rejoiced he was, and how he bragged of it in the servants’ hall! Well, the evening came, and the footman walked into the lodge, and was shown to her sitting-room; for the lodge-keeper and his wife stood in great awe of her, and gave her two nice rooms for herself. Well, he sat down as stiff as a ramrod, and was talking in a grand style about the great doings at the castle, while she was getting the tea and toast ready. ‘Oh,’ says she to him, ‘would you put your hand out at the window and cut me off a sprig or two of honeysuckle?’ He got up in great glee, and put out his hand and head; and said she, ‘By the virtue of my magic gifts, let a pair of horns spring out of your head, and sing to the lodge.’ Just as she wished, so it was. They sprung from the front of each ear, and met at the back. Oh, the poor wretch! And how he bawled and roared! and the servants that he used to be boasting to were soon flocking from the castle, and grinning, and huzzaing, and beating tunes on tongs and shovels and pans; and he cursing and swearing, and the eyes ready to start out of his head, and he so black in the face, and kicking out his legs behind him like mad.At last she pitied him, and removed the charm, and the horns dropped down on the ground, and he would have killed her on the spot, only he was as weak as water, and his fellow-servants came in and carried him up to the big house. Well, some way or other the story came to the ears of the prince, and he strolled down that way. She had only the dress of a countrywoman on her as she sat sewing at the window, but that did not hide her beauty, and he was greatly puzzled after he had a good look, just as a body is puzzled to know whether something happened to him when he was young or if he only dreamed it. Well, the witch’s daughter heard about it too, and she came to see the strange girl; and what did she find her doing but cutting out the pattern of a gown from brown paper; and as she cut away, the paper became the richest silk she ever saw. The witch’s daughter looked on with greedy eyes, and, says she, ‘What would you be satisfied to take for that scissors?’ ‘I’ll take nothing,’ says she, ‘but leave to spend one night outside the prince’s chamber.’ Well, the proud lady fired up, and was going to say something dreadful; but the scissors kept on cutting, and the silk growing richer and richer every inch. So she promised what the girl had asked her.When night came on she was let into the palace and lay down till the prince was in such a dead sleep that all she did couldn’t awake him. She sung this verse to him, sighing and sobbing, and kept singing it the night long, and it was all in vain:Four long years I was married to thee; Three sweet babes I bore to thee; Brown Bear of Norway, turn to me.At the first dawn the proud lady was in the chamber, and led her away, and the footman of the horns put out his tongue at her as she was quitting the palace.So there was no luck so far; but the next day the prince passed by again and looked at her, and saluted her kindly, as a prince might a farmer’s daughter, and passed one; and soon the witch’s daughter passed by, and found her combing her hair, and pearls and diamonds dropping from it.Well, another bargain was made, and the princess spent another night of sorrow, and she left the castle at daybreak, and the footman was at his post and enjoyed his revenge.The third day the prince went by, and stopped to talk with the strange woman. He asked her could he do anything to serve her, and she said he might. She asked him did he ever wake at night. He said that he often did, but that during the last two nights he was listening to a sweet song in his dreams, and could not wake, and that the voice was one that he must have known and loved in some other world long ago. Says she, ‘Did you drink any sleepy posset either of these evenings before you went to bed?’ ‘I did,’ said he. ‘The two evenings my wife gave me something to drink, but I don’t know whether it was a sleepy posset or not.’ ‘Well, prince,’ said she, ‘as you say you would wish to oblige me, you can do it by not tasting any drink to-night.’ ‘I will not,’ says he, and then he went on his walk.Well, the great lady came soon after the prince, and found the stranger using her hand-reel and winding threads of gold off it, and the third bargain was made.That evening the prince was lying on his bed at twilight, and his mind much disturbed; and the door opened, and in his princess walked, and down she sat by his bedside and sung:Four long years I was married to thee; Three sweet babes I bore to thee; Brown Bear of Norway, turn to me.‘Brown Bear of Norway !’ said he. ‘I don’t understand you.’ ‘Don’t you remember, prince, that I was your wedded wife for four years?’ ‘I do not,’ said he, ‘but I’m sure I wish it was so.’ ‘Don’t you remember our three babes that are still alive?’ ‘Show me them. My mind is all a heap of confusion.’ ‘Look for the half of our marriage ring, that hangs at your neck, and fit it to this.’ He did so, and the same moment the charm was broken. His full memory came back on him, and he flung his arms round his wife’s neck, and both burst into tears.Well, there was a great cry outside, and the castle walls were heard splitting and cracking. Everyone in the castle was alarmed, and made their way out. The prince and princess went with the rest, and by the time all were safe on the lawn, down came the building, and made the ground tremble for miles round. No one ever saw the witch and her daughter afterwards. It was not long till the prince and princess had their children with them, and then they set out for their own palace. The kings of Ireland and of Munster and Ulster, and their wives, soon came to visit them, and may every one that deserves it be as happy as the Brown Bear of Norway and his family.","['king',

1172,irish,The Priest's Supper,"It is said by those who ought to understand such things, that the good people, or the fairies, are some of the angels who. were turned out of heaven, and who landed on their feet in this world, while the rest of their companions, who had more sin to sink them, went down further to a worse place. Be this as it may, there was a merry troop of the fairies, dancing and playing all manner of wild pranks on a bright moonlight evening towards the end of September. The scene of their merriment was not far distant from Inchegeela, in the west of the county Cork – a poor village, although it had a barrack for soldiers; but great mountains and barren rocks, like those round about it, are enough to strike poverty into any place however, as the fairies can have every thing they want for wishing, poverty does not trouble them much, and all their care is to seek out unfrequented nooks and places where it is not likely any one will come to spoil their sport.On a nice green sod by the river’s side were the little fellows dancing in a ring as gaily as may be, with their red caps wagging about at every bound in the moonshine; and so light were these bounds, that the lobes of dew, although they trembled under their feet, were not disturbed by their capering. Thus did they carry on their gambols, spinning round and round, and twirling and bobbing, and diving and going through all manner of figures, until one of them chirped out,“Cease, cease, with your drumming,Here’s an end to our mumming,By my smellI can tellA priest this way is coming!”And away every one of the fairies scampered off as hard as they could, concealing themselves under the green leaves of the lusmore, where, if their little red caps should happen to peep out, they would only look like its crimson bells; and more hid themselves in the hollow of stones, or at the shady side ol’ brambles, and others under the bank of the river, and in holes and crannies of one kind or another.The fairy speaker was not mistaken; for along the road, which was within view of the river, came Father Horrigan on his pony, thinking to himself that as it was so late he would make an end of his journey at the first cabin he came to. According to this determination, he stopped at the dwelling of Dermod Leary, lifted the latch, and entered with ” My blessing on all here.”I need not say that Father Horrigan was a welcome guest wherever he went, for no man was more pious or better beloved in the country. Now it was a great trouble to Dermod that he had nothing to offer his reverence for supper as a relish to the potatoes which ” the old woman,” for so Dermod called his wife, though she was not much past twenty, had down boiling in the pot over the fire; he thought of the net which be had set in the river, but as it had been there only a short time, the chances were against his finding a fish in it. ” No matter,” thought Dermod, “there can be no harm in stepping down to try, and may be as I want the fish for the priest’s supper that one will be there before me.”Down to the river side went Dermod, and he found in the net as fine a salmon as ever jumped in the bright waters of “the spreading Lee;” but as he was going to take it out, the net was pulled from him, he could not telll how or by whom, and away got the salmon, and went swimming along with the current as gaily as if nothing had happened.Dermod looked sorrowfully at the wake which the fish had left upon the water, shining like a line of silver in the moonlight, and then,. with an angry motion of his right hand, and a stamp of his foot, gave vent to his feelings by muttering, “May bitter bad luck attend you night and day for a blackguard schemer of a salmon, wherever you go! You ought to be ashamed of yourself, if there ‘s any shame in you, to give me the slip after this fashion And I’m clear in my own mind you’ll come to no good, for some kind of evil thing or other helped you – did I not feel it pull the net against me as strong as the devil himself?”That’s not true for you,” said one of the little fairies, who had scampered off at the approach of the priest, coming up to Dermod Leary, with a whole throng of companions at his heels; “there was only a dozen and a half of us pulling against you.”Dermod gazed on the tiny speaker with wonder, who continued, “Make yourself noways uneasy about the priest’s supper; for if you will go back and ask him one question from us, there will be as fine a supper as ever was put on a table spread out before him in less than no time.”” I’ll have nothing at all to do with you,” replied Dermod, in a tone of determination; and after a pause he added, “I’m much obliged to you for your offer, sir, but I know better than to sell myself to you or the like of you for a supper; and more than that, I know Father Horrigan has more regard for my soul than to wish me to pledge it for ever, out of regard to any thing you could put before him – so there’s an end of the matter.”The little speaker, with a pertinacity not to be repulsed by Dermod’s manner, continued, ” Will you ask the priest one civil question for us?”Dermod considered for some time, and he was right in doing so, but he thought that no one could come to harm out of asking a civil question. “I see no objection to do that same, gentlemen,” said Dermod; ” but I will have nothing in life to do with your supper,. – mind that.”Then,” said the little speaking fairy, whilst the rest came crowding after him from all parts, “go and ask Father Horrigan to tell us whether our souls will be saved at the last day, like the souls of good Christians; and if you wish us well, bring back word what lie says without delay.”Away went Dermod to his cabin, where he found the potatoes thrown out on the table, and his good woman handing the biggest of them all, a beautiful laughing red apple, smoking like a hard-ridden horse on a frosty night, over to Father Horrigan.Please your reverence,” said Dermod, after some hesitation, ” may I make bold to ask your honour one question?”“What may that be?” said Father Horrigan.“Why, then, begging your reverence’s pardon for my freedom, it is, If the souls of the good people are to be saved at the last day?”“Who bid you ask me that question, Leary?” said the priest, fixing his eyes upon him very sternly, which Dermod could not stand before at all.“I’ll tell no lies about the matter, and nothing in life but the truth,” said Dermod. “It was the good people themselves who sent me to ask the question, and there they are in thousands down on the bank of the river waiting for me to go back with the answer.“Go back by all means,” said the priest, “and tell them, if they want to know, to come here to me themselves, and I’ll answer that or any other question they are pleased to ask with the greatest pleasure in life.”Dermod accordingly returned to the fairies, who came swarming round about him to hear what the priest had said in reply; and Dermod spoke out among them like a bold man as lie was: but when they heard that they must go to the priest, away they fled, some here and more there; and some this way and m6re that, whisking by poor Dermod so fast and in such numbers, that he was quite bewildered.When he came to himself; which was not for a long time, back he went to his cabin and ate his dry potatoes along with Father Horrigan, who made quite light of the thing; but Dermod could not help thinking it a mighty hard case that his reverence, whose words had the power to banish the fairies at such a rate, should have no sort of relish to his supper, and that the fine salmon he had in the net should have been got away from him in such a manner.","['ought',

1248,irish,The Fairy Tree of Dooros,"Once upon a time the fairies of the west, going home from a hurling-match with the fairies of the lakes, rested in Dooros Wood for three days and three nights. They spent the days feasting and the nights dancing in the light of the moon, and they danced so hard that they wore the shoes off their feet, and for a whole week after the leprechauns, the fairies’ shoemakers, were working night and day making new ones, and the rip, rap, tap, tap of their little hammers were heard in all the hedgerows.The food on which the fairies feasted were little red berries, and were so like those that grow on the rowan tree that if you only looked at them you might mistake one for the other; but the fairy berries grow only in fairyland, and are sweeter than any fruit that grows here in this world, and if an old man, bent and grey, ate one of them, he became young and active and strong again; and if an old woman, withered and wrinkled, ate one of them, she became young and bright and fair; and if a little maiden who was not handsome ate of them, she became lovelier than the flower of beauty.The fairies guarded the berries as carefully as a miser guards his gold, and whenever they were about to leave fairyland they had to promise in the presence of the king and queen that they would not give a single berry to mortal man, nor allow one to fall upon the earth; for if a single berry fell upon the earth a slender tree of many branches, bearing clusters of berries, would at once spring up, and mortal men might eat of them.But it chanced that this time they were in Dooros Wood they kept up the feasting and dancing so long, and were so full of joy because of their victory over the lake fairies, that one little, weeny fairy, not much bigger than my finger, lost his head, and dropped a berry in the wood.When the feast was ended the fairies went back to fairyland, and were at home for more than a week before they knew of the little fellow’s fault, and this is how they came to know of it.A great wedding was about to come off, and the queen of the fairies sent six of her pages to Dooros Wood to catch fifty butterflies with golden spots on their purple wings, and fifty white without speck or spot, and fifty golden, yellow as the cowslip, to make a dress for herself, and a hundred white, without speck or spot, to make dresses for the bride and bridesmaids.When the pages came near the wood they heard the most wonderful music, and the sky above them became quite dark, as if a cloud had shut out the sun. They looked up, and saw that the cloud was formed of bees, who in a great swarm were flying towards the wood and humming as they flew. Seeing this they were sore afraid until they saw the bees settling on a single tree, and on looking closely at the tree they saw it was covered with fairy berries.The bees took no notice of the fairies, and so they were no longer afraid, and they hunted the butterflies until they had captured the full number of various colours. Then they returned to fairyland, and they told the queen about the bees and the berries, and the queen told the king.The king was very angry, and he sent his heralds to the four corners of fairyland to summon all his subjects to his presence that he might find out without delay who was the culprit.They all came except the little weeny fellow who dropped the berry, and of course every one said that it was fear that kept him away, and that he must be guilty.The heralds were at once sent in search of him, and after a while they found him hiding in a cluster of ferns, and brought him before the king.The poor little fellow was so frightened that at first he could scarcely speak a word, but after a time he told how he never missed the berry until he had returned to fairyland, and that he was afraid to say anything to anyone about it.The king, who would hear of no excuse, sentenced the little culprit to be banished into the land of giants beyond the mountains, to stay there for ever and a day unless he could find a giant willing to go to Dooros Wood and guard the fairy tree. When the king had pronounced sentence everyone was very sorry, because the little fellow was a favourite with them all. No fairy harper upon his harp, or piper upon his pipe, or fiddler upon his fiddle, could play half so sweetly as he could play upon an ivy leaf; and when they remembered all the pleasant moonlit nights on which they had danced to his music, and thought that they should never hear or dance to it any more, their little hearts were filled with sorrow. The queen was as sad as any of her subjects, but the king’s word should be obeyed.When the time came for the little fellow to set out into exile the queen sent her head page to him with a handful of berries. These the queen said he was to offer to the giants, and say at the same time that the giant who was willing to guard the tree could feast on berries just as sweet from morn till night.As the little fellow went on his way nearly all the fairies followed him to the borders of the land, and when they saw him go up the mountain towards the land of the giants, they all took off their little red caps and waved them until he was out of sight.On he went walking all day and night, and when the sun rose on the morrow he was on the top of the mountain, and he could see the land of the giants in the valley stretched far below him. Before beginning his descent he turned round for a last glimpse of fairyland; but he could see nothing, for a thick, dark cloud shut it out from view. He was very sad, and tired, and footsore, and as he struggled down the rough mountain side, he could not help thinking of the soft, green woods and mossy pathways of the pleasant land he had left behind him.When he awoke the ground was trembling, and a noise that sounded like thunder fell on his ears. He looked up and saw coming towards him a terrible giant, with one eye that burned like a live coal in the middle of his forehead, his mouth stretched from ear to ear, his teeth were long and crooked, the skin of his face was as black as night, and his arms and chest were all covered with black, shaggy hair; round his body was an iron band, and hanging from this by a chain was a great club with iron spikes. With one blow of this club he could break a rock into splinters, and fire could not burn him, and water could not drown him, and weapons could not wound him, and there was no way to kill him but by giving him three blows of his own club. And he was so bad-tempered that the other giants called him Sharvan the Surly. When the giant spied the red cap of the little fairy he gave the shout that sounded like thunder. The poor fairy was shaking from head to foot.“What brought you here?” said the giant.“Please, Mr. Giant,” said the fairy, “the king of the fairies banished me here, and here I must stay for ever and a day, unless you come and guard the fairy tree in Dooros Wood.”“Unless what?” roared the giant, and he gave the fairy a touch of his foot that sent the little fellow rolling down head over heels.“Sharvan took him up gently between his finger and thumb.” Illustration by S.W. Fazin, published in Irish Fairy Tales by Edmund Leamy (1906), Magill and Son.The poor fairy lay as if he were dead, and then the giant, feeling sorry for what he had done, took him up gently between his finger and thumb.“Don’t be frightened, little man,” said he, “and now, tell me all about the tree.”“It is the tree of the fairy berry that grows in the Wood of Dooros,” said the fairy, “and I have some of the berries with me.”“Oh, you have, have you?” said the giant. “Let me see them.”The fairy took three berries from the pocket of his little green coat, and gave them to the giant.The giant looked at them for a second. He then swallowed the three together, and when he had done so, he felt so happy that he began to shout and dance for joy.“More, you little thief!” said he. “More, you little–––what’s your name?” said the giant.“Pinkeen, please, Mr. Giant,” said the fairy, as he gave up all the berries.The giant shouted louder than before, and his shouts were heard by all the other giants, who came running towards him.When Sharvan saw them coming, he caught up Pinkeen, and put him in his pocket, that they shouldn’t see him.“What were you shouting for?” said the giants.“Because,” said Sharvan, “that rock there fell down on my big toe.”“You did not shout like a man that was hurt,” said they.“What is it to you what way I shouted?” said he.“You might give a civil answer to a civil question,” said they; “but sure you were always Sharvan the Surly;” and they went away.When the giants were out of sight, Sharvan took Pinkeen out of his wallet.“Some more berries, you little thief––I mean little Pinkeen,” said he.“I have not any more,” said Pinkeen; “but if you will guard the tree in Dooros Wood you can feast on them from morn till night.”“I’ll guard every tree in the wood, if I may do that,” said the giant.“You’ll have to guard only one,” said Pinkeen.“How am I to get to it?” said Sharvan.“You must first come with me towards fairyland,” said the fairy.“Very well,” said Sharvan; “let us go.” And he took up the fairy and put him into his wallet, and before very long they were on the top of the mountain. Then the giant looked around towards the giant’s land; but a black cloud shut it out from view, while the sun was shining on the valley that lay before him, and he could see away in the distance the green woods and shining waters of fairyland.It was not long until he reached its borders, but when he tried to cross them his feet stuck to the ground and he could not move a step. Sharvan gave three loud shouts that were heard all over fairyland, and made the trees in the woods tremble, as if the wind of a storm was sweeping over them.“Oh, please, Mr. Giant, let me out,” said Pinkeen. Sharvan took out the little fellow, who, as soon as he saw he was on the borders of fairyland ran as fast as his legs could carry him, and before he had gone very far he met all the little fairies who, hearing the shouts of the giant, came trooping out from the ferns to see what was the matter. Pinkeen told them it was the giant who was to guard the tree, shouting because he was stuck fast on the borders, and they need have no fear of him.The fairies were so delighted to have Pinkeen back again, that they took him up on their shoulders and carried him to the king’s palace, and all the harpers and pipers and fiddlers marched before him playing the most jocund music that was ever heard. The king and queen were on the lawn in front of the palace when the gay procession came up and halted before them. The queen’s eyes glistened with pleasure when she saw the little favourite, and the king was also glad at heart, but he looked very grave as he said:“Why have you returned, sirrah?”Then Pinkeen told his majesty that he had brought with him a giant who was willing to guard the fairy tree.“And who is he and where is he?” asked the king.“The other giants called him Sharvan the Surly,” said Pinkeen, “and he is stuck fast outside the borders of fairyland.”“It is well,” said the king, “you are pardoned.”When the fairies heard this they tossed their little red caps in the air, and cheered so loudly that a bee who was clinging to a rose-bud fell senseless to the ground.Then the king ordered one of his pages to take a handful of berries, and to go to Sharvan and show him the way to Dooros Wood. The page, taking the berries with him, went off to Sharvan, whose roaring nearly frightened the poor little fellow to death. But as soon as the giant tasted the berries he got into good humour, and he asked the page if he could remove the spell of enchantment from him.“I can,” said the page, “and I will if you promise me that you will not try to cross the borders of fairyland.”“I promise that, with all my heart,” said the giant. “But hurry on, my little man, for there are pins and needles in my legs.”The page plucked a cowslip, and picking out the five little crimson spots in the cup of it, he flung one to the north, and one to the south, and one to the east, and one to the west, and one up into the sky, and the spell was broken, and the giant’s limbs were free. Then Sharvan and the fairy page set off for Dooros Wood, and it was not long until they came within view of the fairy tree. When Sharvan saw the berries glistening in the sun, he gave a shout so loud and strong that the wind of it blew the little fairy back to fairyland. But he had to return to the wood to tell the giant that he was to stay all day at the foot of the tree ready to do battle with anyone who might come to steal the berries, and that during the night he was to sleep amongst the branches.“All right,” said the giant, who could scarcely speak, as his mouth was full of berries.Well, the fame of the fairy-tree spread far and wide, and every day some adventurer came to try if he could carry away some of the berries; but the giant, true to his word, was always on the watch, and not a single day passed on which he did not fight and slay a daring champion, and the giant never received a wound, for fire could not burn him, nor water drown him, nor weapon wound him.Now, at this time, when Sharvan was keeping watch and ward over the tree, a cruel king was reigning over the lands that looked towards the rising sun. He had slain the rightful king by foul means, and his subjects, loving their murdered sovereign, hated the usurper; but much as they hated him they feared him more, for he was brave and masterful, and he was armed with a helmet and shield which no weapon made by mortal hands could pierce, and he carried always with him two javelins that never missed their mark, and were so fatal that they were called “the shafts of death.”The murdered king had two children––a boy, whose name was Niall, and a girl, who was called Rosaleen––that is, little Rose; but no rose that ever bloomed was half as sweet or fresh or fair as she. Cruel as the tyrant king was, he was afraid of the people to kill the children. He sent the boy adrift on the sea in an open boat, hoping the waves would swallow it; and he got an old witch to cast the spell of deformity over Rosaleen, and under the spell her beauty faded, until at last she became so ugly and wasted that scarcely anyone would speak to her. And, shunned by everyone, she spent her days in the out-houses with the cattle, and every night she cried herself to sleep.One day, when she was very lonely, a little robin came to pick the crumbs that had fallen about her feet. He appeared so tame that she offered him the bread from her hand, and when he took it she cried with joy at finding that there was one living thing that did not shun her. After this the robin came every day, and he sang so sweetly for her that she almost forgot her loneliness and misery. But once while the robin was with her the tyrant king’s daughter, who was very beautiful, passed with her maids of honour, and, seeing Rosaleen, the princess said:“Oh, there is that horrid ugly thing.”The maids laughed and giggled, and said they had never seen such a fright.Poor Rosaleen felt as if her heart would break, and when the princess and her maids were out of sight she almost cried her eyes out. When the robin saw her crying he perched on her shoulder and rubbed his little head against her neck and chirruped softly in her ear, and Rosaleen was comforted, for she felt she had at least one friend in the world, although it was only a little robin. But the robin could do more for her than she could dream of. He heard the remark made by the princess, and he saw Rosaleen’s tears, and he knew now why she was shunned by everybody, and why she was so unhappy. And that very evening he flew off to Dooros Wood, and called on a cousin of his and told him all about Rosaleen.“And you want some of the fairy berries, I suppose,” said his cousin, Robin of the Wood.“I do,” said Rosaleen’s little friend.“Ah,” said Robin of the Wood, “times have changed since you were here last. The tree is guarded now all the day long by a surly giant. He sleeps in the branches during the night, and he breathes upon them and around them every morning, and his breath is poison to bird and bee. There is only one chance open, and if you try that it may cost you your life.”“Then tell me what it is, for I would give a hundred lives for Rosaleen,” said her own little robin.“Well,” said Robin of the Wood, “every day a champion comes to battle with the giant, and the giant, before he begins the fight, puts a branch of berries in the iron belt that’s around his waist, so that when he feels tired or thirsty he can refresh himself, and there is just a bare chance, while he is fighting, of picking one of the berries from the branch; but if his breath fall on you it is certain death.”“I will take the chance,” said Rosaleen’s robin.“Very well,” said the other. And the two birds flew through the wood until they came within sight of the fairy tree. The giant was lying stretched at the foot of it, eating the berries; but it was not long until a warrior came, who challenged him to battle. The giant jumped up, and plucking a branch from the tree stuck it in his belt, and swinging his iron club above his head strode towards the warrior, and the fight began. The robin perched on a tree behind the giant, and watched and waited for his chance; but it was a long time coming, for the berries were in front of the giant’s belt. At last the giant, with one great blow, struck the warrior down, but as he did so he stumbled and fell upon him, and before he had time to recover himself the little robin darted towards him like a flash and picked off one of the berries, and then, as fast as wings could carry him, he flew towards home, and on his way he passed over a troop of warriors on snow-white steeds. All the horsemen except one wore silver helmets and shining mantles of green silk, fastened by brooches of red gold, but the chief, who rode at the head of the troop, wore a golden helmet, and his mantle was of yellow silk, and he looked by far the noblest of them all. When the robin had left the horsemen far behind him he spied Rosaleen sitting outside the palace gates bemoaning her fate.The robin perched upon her shoulder, and almost before she knew he was there he put the berry between her lips, and the taste was so delicious that Rosaleen ate it at once, and that very moment the witch’s withering spell passed away from her, and she became as lovely as the flower of beauty. Just then the warriors on the snow-white steeds came up, and the chief with the mantle of yellow silk and the golden helmet leaped from his horse, and bending his knee before her, said:“Fairest of all fair maidens, you are surely the daughter of the king of these realms, even though you are without the palace gates, unattended, and wear not royal robes. I am the Prince of the Sunny Valleys.”“Daughter of a king I am,” said Rosaleen, “but not of the king who rules these realms.”And saying this she fled, leaving the prince wondering who she could be. The prince then ordered his trumpeters to give notice of his presence outside the palace, and in a few moments the king and all his nobles came out to greet the prince and his warriors, and give them welcome. That night a great feast was spread in the banquet-hall, and the Prince of the Sunny Valleys sat by the king, and beside the prince sat the king’s beautiful daughter, and then in due order sat the nobles of the court and the warriors who had come with the prince, and on the wall behind each noble and warrior his shield and helmet were suspended, flashing radiance through the room. During the feast the prince spoke most graciously to the lovely lady at his side, but all the time he was thinking of the unknown beauty he had met outside the palace gates, and his heart longed for another glimpse of her.When the feast was ended, and the jewelled drinking-cups had gone merrily around the table, the bards sang, to the accompaniment of harps, the “Courtship of the Lady Eimer,” and as they pictured her radiant beauty outshining that of all her maidens, the prince thought that fair as Lady Eimer was there was one still fairer.When the feast was ended the king asked the prince what brought him into his realms.“I come,” said the prince, “to look for a bride, for it was foretold to me in my own country that here only I should find the lady who is destined to share my throne, and fame reported that in your kingdom are to be found the loveliest maidens in all the world, and I can well believe that,” added the prince, “after what I have seen to-day.”When the king’s daughter heard this she hung down her head and blushed like a rose, for, of course, she thought the prince was alluding only to herself, as she did not know that he had seen Rosaleen, and she had not heard of the restoration of her beauty.Before another word could be spoken a great noise and the clang of arms were heard outside the palace. The king and his guests started from their seats and drew their swords, and the bards raised the song of battle; but their voices were stilled and their harps silenced when they saw at the threshold of the banquet hall a battle champion, in whose face they recognised the features of their murdered king.“’Tis Niall come back to claim his father’s throne,” said the chief bard. “Long live Niall!”“Long live Niall!” answered all the others.The king, white with rage and amazement, turned to the chiefs and nobles of his court, and cried out:“Is there none loyal enough to drive that intruder from the banquet hall?”But no one stirred, and no answer was given. Then the king rushed forward alone, but before he could reach the spot where Niall was standing he was seized by a dozen chiefs and at once disarmed.During this scene the king’s daughter had fled frightened; but Rosaleen, attracted by the noise, and hearing her brother’s name and the cheers which greeted it, had entered the banquet hall unperceived by anyone. But when her presence was discovered every eye was dazzled with her beauty. Niall looked at her for a second, wondering if the radiant maiden before him could be the little sister he had been separated from for so many years. In another second she was clasped in his arms.Then the feast was spread again, and Niall told the story of his adventures; and when the Prince of the Sunny Valley asked for the hand of Rosaleen, Niall told his lovely sister to speak for herself. With downcast eyes and smiling lips she said, “yes,” and that very day was the gayest and brightest wedding that ever took place, and Rosaleen became the prince’s bride.In her happiness she did not forget the little robin, who was her friend in sorrow.

1254,irish,The Old King Comes Back,"When Mrs. O’Brien and Kathleen left home they walked through the Park and to the Sullivans’. Peter was away. Terence half sat and half lay on the floor in a corner. He held his right hand behind him and covered his face with his left arm. His whole body shook as if he were riding in a cart over a rough road. Ellen sat close to him, trying to soothe him and trying to get him to tell her what was the matter.When Mrs. O’Brien and Kathleen came in Terence seemed to try to make himself smaller, but he did nothing else. “Ellen,” said Mrs. O’Brien, “come outside the room here for a moment; I have something to tell you.”“Look at Terence there,” Ellen answered; “how can I leave him when he’s that way?”“Leave him,” said Mrs. O’Brien, “and come out here with me.”She took Ellen by the hand and led her, and Ellen followed. There was something in Mrs. O’Brien’s look now that told her she would have to come. “Now look at me,” said Mrs. O’Brien, when they were out of the room; “do I look as if I would mean every word I said, or do I not?”Ellen did not answer, and Mrs. O’Brien said: “Ellen, when it was only your own affair I told you what you ought to do, but I let you take your own way. But now it is Kathleen’s affair and John’s and mine, and it is time that I had my way. Look at me, Ellen, and tell me, do I look as if I meant to have it?”Again Ellen looked in the old woman’s face and said nothing for an instant. Then she looked down again in a confused way, and said: “I must go back to Terence.”“Ellen,” said the old woman, “go down to the kitchen. We’ll follow you, and Terence can come, too, if he likes, and I think he will.”Without a word Ellen went down the stairs. Mrs. O’Brien called to Terence: “We are going to the kitchen; you can come if you like.”Mrs. O’Brien and Kathleen followed Ellen, and Terence followed them. He slipped down the stairs like a bundle of rags. He stole into the kitchen after the others and half sat and half lay in the corner, as he had done in the room above, only he did not cover his face with his arm, but kept his eyes on Mrs. O’Brien to see what she was going to do.“Now, Ellen,” Mrs. O’Brien whispered, “put your largest pot on the fire, put water in it, and let it boil.”Ellen looked at the old woman as if she were begging her not to do this. The old woman looked back at her, and then she did it. She put the pot on the fire and the water in the pot. “Now bring all the eggs you have in the house,” Mrs. O’Brien said.Ellen was past asking questions now, and she brought the eggs. It always takes a long time for water to boil, and it seemed to all of them as if it took hours for this water to boil. While they were waiting not one of them spoke and they scarcely moved. Terence was all but holding his breath, and his eyes, red and staring, were now upon Mrs. O’Brien and now upon Ellen, and never at rest. Kathleen looked at Terence and clutched the little crucifix in her hand. But she need not have been afraid of Terence; he knew the crucifix as well as he cared to know it.After a long time the water boiled. Mrs. O’Brien waited till it was boiling as hard as ever it could, and then she whispered to Ellen: “Break the eggs now; keep the shells and throw away the rest.”Poor Ellen could not guess what it all meant, but she broke the eggs, laid the shells carefully aside, and threw away the rest.“Now,” said Mrs. O’Brien, “put the shells in the pot.”Ellen did as she was told.“What are you doing, mother?” Terence called from his corner.“Tell him you are brewing,” Mrs. O’Brien whispered.“I’m brewing, Terence,” said Ellen, scarcely loud enough to be heard.“And what are you brewing?” Terence asked again.“Say egg-shells,” Mrs. O’Brien whispered.“Egg-shells, Terence,” Ellen said.Terence sprang to his feet. “Egg-shells!” he cried. “For near six thousand years I have lived on this earth, and never till this minute did I see anybody brew egg-shells!”Mrs. O’Brien had turned upon him before he had done speaking. “Six thousand years, is it, that you’ve been on this earth?” she cried. “Then go and spend the rest of the years where you spent the six thousand! You’ve been long enough here! And send back the child that was stolen when you came here!”Terence sprang toward a window. Ellen stood in his way; he struck her in the face with his open hand and threw her on the floor. After that nobody saw him but Kathleen. She saw him go toward the window. It was open just a little crack. Before her very eyes he grew smaller and smaller, till he scrambled and rolled and slipped through the crack and was gone.That very instant the door opened and the Hill Terence came in. He saw Ellen lying on the floor, and, without noticing anyone else, he went to her and lifted her up. Ellen looked in his face, started back from him for an instant, still gazing in his face, and then caught him in her arms and cried, with her voice all full of tears, “It’s my own boy—my own boy—the one I always saw in my dreams! Don’t come near me, any of you, or you’ll wake me and it’ll be another dream! Oh, let me keep this dream while I can!”“You’ll keep this dream always, Ellen, dear,” the old woman said. “Have no more fear. This is the dream that’s for all your life and forever.”It was about that time, or it may have been a little later, that Peter came in. They told him all about it as well as they could. “It’s glad I am that it all came out so,” Peter said, after they had completely bewildered him by trying to make him understand the story; “it’s glad I am. And yet I did like to hear Terence play the fiddle.”“I can play the fiddle a little too,” the new Terence said.“Oh, yes, indeed he can!” said Kathleen. “Bring the fiddle and he will show you.”Peter brought the fiddle and Terence played, and the fiddle sang a great song of gladness—the song of a soul born to find itself a full man all at once.“Ah! don’t you see now? Don’t you see now?” Kathleen cried. “That means something!”The fairies in the hill were dancing their endless dance, when Naggeneen, as if he had been lifted up in the air and dropped, was suddenly among them. They stopped the dance and gathered around him. “What for are you back here?” the King asked.“They drove me out!” Naggeneen cried. “I knew they would! I told you they would! I told you you could do nothing and I could do nothing! It’s the only wonder that they didn’t drive me out long ago.”“What do you keep your hand behind you for?” the King asked.“I couldn’t tell you that,” said Naggeneen; “I couldn’t say the words that I’ld have to say to tell you.”“And how did they drive you out?”“By brewing egg-shells.”“And do you mean,” the King cried, “that you let them catch you with that old trick? I thought you was clever.”“Let them catch me! I couldn’t help what they did! I tried to help it, but it’s a spell that’s too strong for me or for any of us. If I was to get a soul by it, I couldn’t help saying: ‘What are you doing, mother?’ and then I couldn’t help saying how long I had been on the earth. Ah, didn’t I always tell you mortals was more powerful than us, if they only knew how? What are our spells and our charms to theirs?”“And where is Terence, then?” the King asked.“He’s not come in yet,” somebody answered.“You know where he must be by this time,” said Naggeneen. “He’s back with his father and his mother by now. Where else could he be?”“There’ll be no geometry to-night,” the King said. “It’s all done; we’ve failed in that. We’ll always be as we are, as you told us, Naggeneen. So now be as you were yourself and give us a tune to dance by. We was dancing when you came in, but it was no good music we had.”“I’ll not play any more,” Naggeneen said; “that’s all done too. But I have something more to tell you. Kathleen O’Brien can see us, whether we like it or not. Some fool of you must have given her the ointment when she was here, and now she has used it on her eyes. She saw me when I meant to be invisible, and by the same token she can see any of you any time, whether you want to be seen or not. Now you know it’s the rule that she must be blinded in some way. Any of you can do it that likes. I’ve had enough and I warn you. She carries something that none of you can face, if she uses it. But you can watch your chance and do it when she’s asleep or in some way off her guard.”An angry murmur ran around when Naggeneen said this. The King was about to speak, but the Queen spoke first. “Never a one of you shall harm her,” she said. “Look what she did for me and the little Prince, at that time when we can do nothing for ourselves. And how good her grandmother has always been to us; and her mother, when she was alive. I don’t care if she sees everything we do; no one of us shall ever harm her or anyone that belongs to her.”“You are right,” the King said, “and it’s ordered as you say.”“And she’s not to be blinded, then?” said Naggeneen.“She’s not to be harmed,” the King answered. “I forbid you ever to touch her, Naggeneen, and none of us ever will.”“Don’t fear for me,” said Naggeneen. “I’ll never go near her. I’ve had enough.”“And we’ve all had enough,” said the King; “so now, Naggeneen, play for us.”“Leave me be,” said Naggeneen; “I’ll never play for you again. King, did you ever lose what you cared for more than all the world? When you do, you’ll know more than you know now, with all your age and with all your power. I told you once how I carried off the Princess of France and how Guleesh na Guss Dhu stole her from me. I cared nothing for her. It was only the soul that I’ld get from her that I wanted. And this time it was only the soul that I wanted, too, at first, but I loved this one in the end. But a soul will always find out another soul, and there’s nothing for one like us, that has no soul. Oh, I couldn’t even tell her like a man. All I could do was to be always frightening her and threatening her, and I knew all the time that it would drive her away from me at last, or me away from her. And I’ll be like the rest of you till the Last Day, and then it’s not even a little smoke that there’ll be left of us. Dance and play and do what you like, but leave me be.”Naggeneen turned away from the King, pushed his way through the crowd, and threw himself down in a corner of the hall, with his face against the wall. The rest did not dance any more that night. Naggeneen had frightened them, as he always frightened them when he chose.After that for a time everything went with the fairies as it had gone at first, except that Naggeneen was not among them. Sometimes he was in the hall by himself and sometimes he was out of it by himself, but he never danced with the others, he never talked with them, and he never played for them.One day the King came to him as he sat in his corner alone and said, “Naggeneen, we are all going to the wedding. Will you come with us?”“Leave me be,” said Naggeneen. “Why would I want to see it? I don’t know if I’ll ever go with you or do anything with you again, or with anyone, but I know I’ll not now.”All the people who were passing St. Patrick’s Cathedral could tell by the looks of things that if they waited long enough they would see somebody come out. So a good many waited. After a while they saw Terence and Kathleen come out and get into a carriage.“Look,” said Kathleen: “do you see them? They are the Good People! Don’t you see them all around us, in the street and in the air, and everywhere? I remember every one of them—the funny little men and the pretty little girls. Oh, you goose, you have lived with them all your life, and still you can’t see them except when they want you to. But my eyes are different, and I can see them always. Here is one of them coming close to the carriage. It is the King. Yes, Your Majesty. What do you think he says, Terence? He says that they are never going to try to put my eyes out and are never going to do me any harm at all, and that I am never to be afraid of them.”Presently the people who were waiting outside the Cathedral saw John O’Brien and his mother come out and get into another carriage. “Shaun,” said the old woman, “I’m wishing that poor Kitty—Heaven rest her soul!—could be here to-day.”“I was thinking that same, mother,” said John.“I think she sees it all,” said his mother.“I think so,” said John.“Shaun,” said the old woman again, “isn’t it all as well as it could be? Isn’t my old King back with us, and isn’t it the luck of O’Donoghue that we’ve found again?”","['brien', 'kathleen', 'left', 'home', 'walk', 'park', 'sullivan', 'peter', 'away', 'terence', 'half',

1279,irish,Preface,"The author of the tales contained in this volume was one of the brightest and most poetic spirits who have appeared in Ireland in the last half century. It is needless to say that he was also one of the most patriotic Irishmen of his generation––patriotic in the highest and widest sense of that term, loving with an ardent love his country, its people, its historic traditions, its hills and plains, its lakes and streams, its raths and mounds. Like all men of his type, he lived largely in the past, and his fancy revelled much in fairy scenes of childhood and youth.The distractions of political life, into which he entered with characteristic enthusiasm, prevented Edmund Leamy from cultivating his favourite field of literature with that assiduity and sustained application necessary for the purpose of bringing out the really great intellectual powers with which he was endowed; otherwise, he would certainly have left to Ireland a large body of literature which would have been the delight of old and young. But in this volume he has given at least an indication of what he was capable of doing towards that end. No one can read these pages without feeling the charm of a fine and delicate fancy, a rare power of poetic expression, and a genuinely Irish instinct; without feeling also an intense regret that the mind and heart from which they proceeded were stilled in death long before the powers of his genius could have been exhausted.To myself, as one of the most intimate friends of Edmund Leamy, it is a melancholy pleasure to have the privilege of writing these few words of introduction to a volume which, for the purpose of preserving his memory amongst his countrymen, needs no introduction at all. The claims of a long friendship, the knowledge of as stainless a life as has ever been lived, and admiration for moral and intellectual endowments of the rarest character, render it easy to praise. But I do not think that I indulge in undue expectation in predicting that the new audience to which this volume will come will rise from its perusal with something of the feelings of love, admiration, and regret which those who knew Edmund Leamy personally will ever cherish in their hearts.J. E.

1314,irish,The Potato Supper,"Some folk say that the Little People, the Fairies, were once angels that were cast out of Heaven for their sins. They fell to earth and grew smaller and smaller. And to-day they dance on moonlit nights in Fairy Rings, and play all manner of pranks.Be that as it may, one night a merry troop of them was capering in the moonshine. On a nice green sward by a river’s bank the little fellows were dancing hand-in-hand, with their red caps wagging at every bound. And so light were their feet that the dew trembled, but was not disturbed. So they danced, spinning around and around, and twirling, and bobbing, and diving, until one of them chirped:—“Cease! Cease with your humming!Here’s an end to your mumming!By my smell I can tellThat a Priest is now coming!”And away all the Fairies scampered as fast as they could. Some hid under the green leaves of the Foxglove, their little caps peeping out like crimson bells. Others crept under the shadow of stones, or beneath the bank of the river.And scarcely had they done so, when along came Father Horrigan riding slowly on his pony. He was thinking to himself that he would end his journey at the first cabin he came to. And so he did, for soon he stopped at the little house of Dermod Leary, and, lifting the latch, walked in with: “A blessing on all here!”And a welcome guest, you may be sure, was Father Horrigan, for no man was better loved in all that country. But when Dermod saw him enter, he was troubled, for he had nothing to offer for supper except some potatoes that his wife was boiling in a pot over the fire. Then he remembered that he had set a net in the river. “There’ll be no harm,” thought he, “in my stepping down to see if anything has been caught.”So down to the river went Dermod. He found as fine a salmon in the net as ever jumped from water. But as he was taking it out, the net was jerked from his hands, and away the salmon went, swimming along as though nothing had happened.Dermod looked sorrowfully at the wake that the fish left shining like a line of silver in the moonlight.“May bitter luck attend you night and day!” cried he, shaking his fist. “Some evil thing sure it was that helped you, for did I not feel it pull the net out of my hand!”“You’re all wrong, Dermod! There were a hundred or more of us pulling against you!” squeaked a little voice near his feet, and the whole troop of Fairies—hundreds and hundreds of them—came rushing from their hiding-places, and stood before him, their red caps nodding violently.Dermod gazed at them in wonder; then one of the Fairies said:—“Make yourself noways uneasy about the Priest’s supper, Dermod Leary. If you will go back and ask him one question for us, there’ll be as fine a supper spread before him in no time, as ever was put on table.”“I’ll have nothing to do with you at all, at all!” answered Dermod; “I know better than to sell my soul to the likes of you!”But the little Fairy was not to be repulsed. “Will you ask the Priest just one civil question for us, Dermod?” said he.Dermod considered for a moment. “I see no objection,” said he, “to the same. But I’ll have nothing to do with your supper, mind that!”The Little People all crowded near him, while the Fairy answered:—“Go and ask Father Horrigan to tell us whether our souls will be saved at the Last Day. And, if you wish us well, Dermod Leary, you will bring the word that he says.”Away went Dermod to his cabin.“Please, your reverence,” said he to Father Horrigan, “may I make bold to ask your honour a question?”“What is it?” said Father Horrigan.“Why, then,” said Dermod, “will the souls of the Little People be saved at the Last Day?”“Who bids you ask that question, Leary?” said Father Horrigan, fixing his eyes sternly on Dermod.“I’ll tell no lies about the matter, nothing in life but the truth,” answered Dermod. “’Twas the Little People themselves who sent me. They are in thousands down on the bank of the river waiting for your word.”“Go back,” said Father Horrigan, “and tell them that if they want to know they must come here to me themselves, and I’ll answer that and any other question.”So back Dermod hurried to the river. The Fairies came swarming around him. They pressed close to his feet, with faces upturned as they anxiously waited. And Dermod, brave man that he was, spoke out boldly and gave them the Priest’s message. And when they heard that, the whole multitude of little Fairies uttered shrill cries and groans; and they whisked past Dermod in such numbers that he was quite bewildered. Then in a trice he found himself alone.He went slowly back to his cabin. He opened the door. The fire was burning brightly. The candles were lighted. And good Father Horrigan was seated comfortably at the table, a pitcher of new milk before him, and a bit of fresh butter, from Dermod’s cow. And Dermod’s wife was handing him a big, handsome potato, whose white, mealy insides were bursting through its skin, and smoking like a hard-ridden horse on a frosty night.Dermod sat down at the table, and began to eat without a word. And when Father Horrigan was through the good Priest smacked his lips, and said that he had relished the hot tasty potatoes, more than a dozen fat salmon, and a whole Fairy feast!","['christmas',

1365,irish,The Legend of Bottle Hill,"“Come listen to a tale of times of old,Come listen to me—”It was in the good days, when the little people, most impudently called fairies, were more frequently seen than they are in these unbelieving times, that a farmer, named Mick Purcell, rented a few acres of barren ground in the neighbourhood of the once celebrated preceptory of Mourne, situated about three miles from Mallow, and thirteen from “the beautiful city called Cork.” Mick had a wife and family: they all did what they could, and that was but little, for the poor man had no child grown up big enough to help him in his work: and all the poor woman could do was to mind the children, and to milk the one cow, and to boil the potatoes, and to carry the eggs to market to Mallow; but with all they could do, ’twas hard enough on them to pay the rent. Well, they did manage it for a good while; but at last came a bad year, and the little grain of oats was all spoiled, and the chickens died of the pip, and the pig got the measles,—she was sold in Mallow, and brought almost nothing; and poor Mick found that he hadn’t enough to half pay his rent, and two gales were due.“Why then, Molly,” says he, “what’ll we do?”“Wisha, then, mavournene, what would you do but take the cow to the fair of Cork and sell her?” says she; “and Monday is fair day, and so you must go to-morrow, that the poor beast may be rested again the fair.”“And what’ll we do when she’s gone?” says Mick, sorrowfully.“Never a know I know, Mick; but sure God won’t leave us without Him, Mick; and you know how good He was to us when poor little Billy was sick, and we had nothing at all for him to take, that good doctor gentleman at Ballydahin come riding and asking for a drink of milk; and how he gave us two shillings; and how he sent the things and bottles for the child, and gave me my breakfast when I went over to ask a question, so he did: and how he came to see Billy, and never left off his goodness till he was quite well?”“Oh! you are always that way, Molly, and I believe you are right after all, so I won’t be sorry for selling the cow; but I’ll go to-morrow, and you must put a needle and thread through my coat, for you know ’tis ripped under the arm.”Molly told him he should have every thing right; and about twelve o’clock next day he left her, getting a charge not to sell his cow except for the highest penny. Mick promised to mind it, and went his way along the road. He drove his cow slowly through the little stream which crosses it and runs by the old walls of Mourne. As he passed he glanced his eye upon the towers and one of the old elder trees which were only then little bits of switches.“Oh, then, if I only had half the money that’s buried in you, ’tisn’t driving this poor cow I’d be now! Why, then, isn’t it too bad that it should be there covered over with earth, and many a one besides me wanting? Well, if it is God’s will, I’ll have some money myself coming back.”So saying, he moved on after his beast; ’twas a fine day, and the sun shone brightly on the walls of the old abbey as he passed under them; he then crossed an extensive mountain tract, and after six long miles he came to the top of that hill—Bottle Hill ’tis called now, but that was not the name of it then, and just there a man overtook him.“Good morrow,” says he. “Good morrow,” kindly, says Mick, looking at the stranger, who was a little man, you’d almost call him a dwarf, only he wasn’t quite so little neither: he had a bit of an old, wrinkled, yellow face, for all the world like a dried cauliflower, only he had a sharp little nose, and red eyes, and white hair, and his lips were not red, but all his face was one colour, and his eyes never were quiet, but looking at every thing, and although they were red, they made Mick feel quite cold when he looked at them. In truth he did not much like the little man’s company; and he couldn’t see one bit of his legs,nor his body; for, though the day was warm, he was all wrapped up in a big great-coat. Mick drove his cow something faster, but the little man kept up with him. Mick didn’t know how he walked, for he was almost afraid to look at him, and to cross himself, for fear the old man would be angry. Yet he thought his fellow-traveller did not seem to walk like other men, nor to put one foot before the other, but to glide over the rough road, and rough enough it was, like a shadow, without noise and without effort. Mick’s heart trembled within him, and he said a prayer to himself, wishing he hadn’t come out that day, or that he was on fair hill, or that he hadn’t the cow to mind, that he might run away from the bad thing—when, in the midst of his fears, he was again addressed by his companion.“Where are you going with the cow, honest man?”“To the fair of Cork then,” says Mick, trembling at the shrill and piercing tones of the voice.“Are you going to sell her?” said the stranger.“Why, then, what else am I going for but to sell her?”“Will you sell her to me?”Mick started—he was afraid to have any thing to do with the little man, and he was more afraid to say no.“What’ll you give for her?” at last says he.“I’ll tell you what, I’ll give you this bottle,” said the little one, pulling a bottle from under his coat.Mick looked at him and the bottle, and, in spite of his terror, he could not help bursting into a loud fit of laughter.“Laugh if you will,” said the little man, “but I tell you this bottle is better for you than all the money you will get for the cow in Cork—ay, than ten thousand times as much.”Mick laughed again. “Why then,” says he, “do you think I am such a fool as to give my good cow for a bottle—and an empty one, too? indeed, then, I won’t.”“You had better give me the cow, and take the bottle—you’ll not be sorry for it.”“Why, then, and what would Molly say? I’d never hear the end of it; and how would I pay the rent? and what would we all do without a penny of money?“I tell you this bottle is better to you than money; take it, and give me the cow. I ask you for the last time, Mick Purcell.”Mick started.“How does he know my name?” thought he.The stranger proceeded: “Mick Purcell, I know you, and I have regard for you; therefore do as I warn you, or you may be sorry for it. How do you know but your cow will die before you get to Cork?”Mick was going to say “God forbid!” but the little man went on (and he was too attentive to say any thing to stop him; for Mick was a very civil man, and he knew better than to interrupt a gentleman, and that’s what many people, that hold their heads higher, don’t mind now).“And how do you know but there will be much cattle at the fair, and you will get a bad price, or may be you might be robbed when you are coming home? but what need I talk more to you when you are determined to throw away your luck, Mick Purcell?“Oh! no, I would not throw away my luck, sir,” said Mick; “and if I was sure the bottle was as good as you say, though I never liked an empty bottle, although I had drank what was in it, I’d give you the cow in the name——”“Never mind names,” said the stranger, “but give me the cow; I would not tell you a lie. Here, take the bottle, and when you go home do what I direct exactly.”Mick hesitated.“Well then, good by, I can stay no longer: once more, take it, and be rich; refuse it, and beg for your life, and see your children in poverty, and your wife dying for want: that will happen to you, Mick Purcell!” said the little man with a malicious grin, which made him look ten times more ugly than ever.“May be ’tis true,” said Mick, still hesitating: he did not know what to do—he could hardly help believing the old man, and at length in a fit of desperation he seized the bottle—”Take the cow,” said he, “and if you are telling a lie, the curse of the poor will be on you.”“I care neither for your curses nor your blessings, but I have spoken truth, Mick Purcell, and that you will find to-night, if you do what I tell you.”“And what’s that?” says Mick.“When you go home, never mind if your wife is angry, but be quiet yourself, and make her sweep the room clean, set the table out right, and spread a clean cloth over it; then put the bottle on the ground, saying these words: ‘Bottle, do your duty,’ and you will see the end of it.”“And is this all?” says Mick.“No more,” said the stranger. “Good by, Mick Purcell—you are a rich man.”“God grant it!” said Mick, as the old man moved after the cow, and Mick retraced the road towards his cabin; but he could not help turning back his head, to look after the purchaser of his cow, who was nowhere to be seen.“Lord between us and harm!” said Mick: “He can’t belong to this earth; but where is the cow?” She too was gone, and Mick went homeward muttering prayers, and holding fast the bottle.“And what would I do if it broke?” thought he. “Oh! but I’ll take care of that;” so he put it into his bosom, and went on anxious to prove his bottle, and doubting of the reception he should meet from his wife; balancing his anxieties with his expectations, his fears with his hopes, he reached home in the evening, and surprised his wife, sitting over the turf fire in the big chimney.“Oh! Mick, are you come back! Sure you wer’n’t at Cork all the way! What has happened to you? Where is the cow? Did you sell her? How much money did you get for her? What news have you? Tell us every thing about it.”“Why then, Molly, if you’ll give me time, I’ll tell you all about it. If you want to know where the cow is, ’tisn’t Mick can tell you, for the never a know does he know where she is now.”“Oh! then, you sold her; and where’s the money?”“Arrah! stop awhile, Molly, and I’ll tell you all about it.”“But what is that bottle under your waistcoat?” said Molly, spying its neck sticking out.“Why, then, be easy now, can’t you,” says Mick, “till I tell it to you?” and putting the bottle on the table, “That’s all I got for the cow.”His poor wife was thunderstruck. “All you got! and what good is that, Mick? Oh! I never thought you were such a fool; and what’ll we do for the rent, and what——”“Now, Molly,” says Mick, “can’t you hearken to reason? Didn’t I tell you how the old man, or whatsomever he was, met me,—no, he did not meet me neither, but he was there with me—on the big hill, and how he made me sell him the cow, and told me the bottle was the only thing for me?”“Yes, indeed, the only thing for you, you fool!” said Molly, seizing the bottle to hurl it at her poor husband’s head; but Mick caught it, and quietly (for he minded the old man’s advice) loosened his wife’s grasp, and placed the bottle again in his bosom. Poor Molly sat down crying, while Mick told his story, with many a crossing and blessing between him and harm. His wife could not help believing him, particularly as she had as much faith in fairies as she had in the priest, who indeed never discouraged her belief in the fairies; may be, he didn’t know she believed in them, and may be, he believed in them himself. She got up, however, without saying one word, and began to sweep the earthen floor with a bunch of heath; then she tidied up every thing, and put out the long table, and spread the clean cloth, for she had only one, upon it, and Mick, placing the bottle on the ground, looked at it and said, “Bottle, do your duty.”“Look there! look there, mammy!” said his chubby eldest son, a boy about five years old—”look there! look there!” and he sprang to his mother’s side, as two tiny little fellows rose like light from the bottle, and in an instant covered the table with dishes and plates of gold and silver, full of the finest victuals that ever were seen, and when all was done went into the bottle again. Mick and his wife looked at every thing with astonishment; they had never seen such plates and dishes before, and didn’t think they could ever admire them enough; the very sight almost took away their appetites; but at length Molly said, “Come and sit down, Mick, and try and eat a bit: sure you ought to be hungry after such a good day’s work.”“Why, then, the man told no lie about the bottle.”Mick sat down, after putting the children to the table; and they made a hearty meal, though they couldn’t taste half the dishes.“Now,” says Molly, “I wonder will those two good little gentlemen carry away these fine things again?” They waited, but no one came; so Molly put up the dishes and plates very carefully, saying, “Why, then, Mick, that was no lie sure enough; but you’ll be a rich man yet, Mick Purcell.”Mick and his wife and children went to their bed, not to sleep, but to settle about selling the fine things they did not want, and to take more land. Mick went to Cork and sold his plate, and bought a horse and cart, and began to show that he was making money; and they did all they could to keep the bottle a secret; but for all that, their landlord found it out, for he came to Mick one day and asked him where he got all his money—sure it was not by the farm; and he bothered him so much, that at last Mick told him of the bottle. His landlord offered him a deal of money for it; but Mick would not give it, till at last he offered to give him all his farm for ever: so Mick, who was very rich, thought he’d never want any more money, and gave him the bottle: but Mick was mistaken—he and his family spent money as if there was no end of it; and, to make the story short, they became poorer and poorer, till at last they had nothing left but one cow; and Mick once more drove his cow before him to sell her at Cork fair, hoping to meet the old man and get another bottle. It was hardly day-break when he left home, and he walked on at a good pace till he reached the big hill: the mists were sleeping in the valleys and curling like smoke-wreaths upon the brown heath around him. The sun rose on his left, and just at his feet a lark sprang from its grassy couch and poured forth its joyous matin song, ascending into the clear blue sky,“Till its form like a speck in the airiness blendingAnd thrilling with music, was melting in light.”Mick crossed himself, listening as he advanced to the sweet song of the lark, but thinking, notwithstanding, all the time of the little old man; when, just as he reached the summit of the hill, and cast his eyes over the extensive prospect before and around him, he was startled and rejoiced by the same well-known voice:—”Well, Mick Purcell, I told you, you would be a rich man.”“Indeed, then, sure enough I was, that’s no lie for you, sir. Good morning to you, but it is not rich I am now—but have you another bottle, for I want it now as much as I did long ago; so if you have it, sir, here is the cow for it.”“And here is the bottle,” said the old man, smiling; “you know what to do with it.”“Oh! then, sure I do, as good right I have.”“Well, farewell forever, Mick Purcell: I told you, you would be a rich man.”“And good bye to you, sir,” said Mick, as he turned back; “and good luck to you, and good luck to the big hill—it wants a name—Bottle Hill.—Good bye, sir, good bye;” so Mick walked back as fast as he could, never looking after the white-faced little gentleman and the cow, so anxious was he to bring home the bottle. Well, he arrived with it safely enough, and called out, as soon as he saw Molly,—”Oh! sure, I’ve another bottle!”“Arrah! then have you? why, then, you’re a lucky man, Mick Purcell, that’s what you are.”In an instant she put every thing right; and Mick, looking at his bottle, exultingly cried out, “Bottle, do your duty.” In a twinkling, two great stout men with big cudgels issued from the bottle (I do not know how they got room in it), and belaboured poor Mick and his wife and all his family, till they lay on the floor, when in they went again. Mick, as soon as he recovered, got up and looked about him; he thought and thought, and at last he took up his wife and his children; and, leaving them to recover as well as they could, he took the bottle under his coat, and went to his landlord, who had a great company: he got a servant to tell him he wanted to speak to him, and at last he came out to Mick.“Well, what do you want now?”“Nothing, sir, only I have another bottle.”“Oh! ho! is it as good as the first?”“Yes, sir, and better; if you like, I will show it to you before all the ladies and gentlemen.”“Come along, then.” So saying, Mick was brought into the great hall, where he saw his old bottle standing high up on a shelf: “Ah! ha!” says he to himself, “may be I won’t have you by and by.”“Now,” says his landlord, “show us your bottle.” Mick set it on the floor, and uttered the words; in a moment the landlord was tumbled on the floor; ladies and gentlemen, servants and all, were running and roaring, and sprawling, and kicking and shrieking. Wine cups and salvers were knocked about in every direction, until the landlord called out, “Stop those two devils, Mick Purcell, or I’ll have you hanged!”“They never shall stop,” said Mick, “till I get my own bottle that I see up there at top of that shelf.”“Give it down to him, give it down to him, before we are all killed!” says the landlord.Mick put the bottle in his bosom; in jumped the two men into the new bottle, and he carried the bottles home. I need not lengthen my story by telling how he got richer than ever, how his son married his landlord’s only daughter, how he and his wife died when they were very old, and how some of the servants, fighting at their wake, broke the bottles; but still the hill has the name upon it; ay, and so ’twill be always Bottle Hill to the end of the world, and so it ought, for it is a strange story.","['upon', 'time', 'live', 'bank', 'stream', 'woman', 'daughter', 'child', 'pretty', 'besides', 'never', 'could', 'make', 'mind', 'punish', 'fault', 'teach', 'nice', 'manner', 'work–', 'laugh',

1409,irish,Little Kathleen and Little Terrence,"The next morning John O’Brien was sitting alone, when there was a knock at the door. Then Peter Sullivan opened it, said “God save all here!” and came in.“God save you kindly!” John answered.“It’s distressed we are,” said Peter, “to hear of the death of poor Kitty. Ellen would be here with me to tell you so, only bein’ in bed herself and not able to stir, and what’ll come to all of us I dunno. I’m that disturbed about her I dunno what I’ll do at all. I left her with one of the neighbors and came to see your mother about her. But sure it’s you has the great grief on you already, whatever comes to us. It’s not only you I’m thinkin’ of, but it’s the child, left with no mother. Oh, it’s a terrible thing.”“My own mother can bring up any child,” John answered. “Have no fear of that. It’s us that knew Kitty that’ll feel the loss of her.”“And how is the child doing, anyway?” Peter asked.“She looks fine and healthy, glory be to God!” said John.“It’s a girl, they tell me.”“Do you know yet what you’ll call her?”“We’ll name her Kathleen, after her mother,” said John.“Then you’ll be calling her Kitty, like her mother, I suppose.”“No—no,” John answered, slowly; “I don’t think I’ll call her that. The child will be always Kathleen. I dunno if I can tell you how I feel about that. It was a name for a child, more than a woman—Kitty—and yet, now that she’s gone from me, I’ve a feeling like it was something more than the name of a woman—like it was something holy, like the name of the blessed Mother of God. When I think of that name now, I want to think only of her, and I wouldn’t like to be calling even her own child by it. It’s Kathleen I’ll call her—nothing else.”“You’re right about all that, no doubt,” said Peter; “but I can’t be staying here, and Ellen and the child at home the way they are. You have your child left, and you say it’s healthy—thank God for that same!—but it looks like I might have neither wife nor child.”“Don’t say that, man alive,” said John; “what’s the matter at all then?”“I can’t stop discoursin’ here,” Peter answered. “I came to ask would your mother, being a knowledgable woman, step over for a bit and see can she tell at all what’s the matter with Ellen and the child. There was a doctor there, but he seemed to do no good, and Ellen said your mother would know more than all the doctors, so I came to ask would she come. And if you care to come yourself, I’ll be telling you how they are as we go along, but I can’t stay here; it’s too long to be away from them.”“Mother is with the child,” said John; “I’ll speak to her.”He went into another room, where the baby was sleeping and his mother was sitting beside her. He told her why Peter had come. “Step downstairs,” said Mrs. O’Brien, “and ask Mrs. Mulvey will she sit by the baby till I’m back. Then I’ll go with him. And you’d better come, too, John; the air will do you good.”John went down to another of the tenements in the house and came back with their neighbor, Mrs. Mulvey. “If you’ll be so kind,” Mrs. O’Brien said, “sit here by the baby till I’m back, and I’ll not be long. And mind you keep everything as it is, unless she wakes, and then you’ll know what to do as well as I, for you’ve children of your own. But don’t disturb the pair of scissors that’s there beside her, and don’t take off the horseshoe nail that’s hung round her neck.”“And what’s them things for?” Mrs. Mulvey asked, with wonder in her eyes.“Why, to keep the Good People from stealing the child,” Mrs. O’Brien answered. “Did you never hear of those things? Don’t you know the Good People can’t stand the touch of iron, or even to be near it? And especially a horseshoe nail they can’t stand. And the scissors, too, they couldn’t come near, and then leaving them open they make a cross, and that keeps the child all the more from the Good People.”John and his mother left Mrs. Mulvey with little Kathleen and went with Peter. “And what’s wrong with Ellen, then?” Mrs. O’Brien asked.“I dunno that there’s so much wrong with herself, as you might say,” Peter answered. “I think it’s more than anything else that she’s worried about the child.”“And what’s wrong with the child, then?”“There’s everything wrong with the child,” said Peter. “It’s not like the same child at all. Last night he was as healthy a boy as you’ld wish to see—quiet and peaceable and good-tempered and strong-looking, for his age. And now this morning he’s thin and sick-looking, and there’s black hair all over his arms, and his face is wrinkled, like he was a little old man, and he does nothing but cry and scream till you can’t bear it, and twist and squirm till you can’t hold him. It’s like he was fairy-struck, only I don’t believe in them things at all.”“Did you watch him close last night?” Mrs. O’Brien asked.“Part of the time,” Peter answered, “but I dare say we was both asleep other times.”“Was Ellen careful about her prayers last night, and were you so, too?”“I can’t say about that,” Peter said. “We might be letting some of them go, such a time as that, you know, and make it up after.”“Yes,” said Mrs. O’Brien, “make it up after by losing your child! Was there any iron anywhere about him?”“I don’t know that there was.”“And did you make a circle of fire about the place where he was lying?”“I did not.”“The child’s not been struck,” said Mrs. O’Brien; “not the way you mean. It’s not your child at all, but one of the Good People themselves, that’s in it. They’ve stolen your child and left a changeling in the place of it.”“It’s the same way you always talked, Mrs. O’Brien,” said Peter. “I don’t believe them things.”They had come to Peter’s door by this time. They found Ellen lying in bed, looking frightened half to death, and beside her was the baby, or the fairy, or whatever it was. It was not crying loudly now, but it was keeping up a little whining and whimpering noise that was quite as unpleasant to listen to as a good, honest cry. Its face looked thin and pinched and old; it had a little thin, wispy hair on its head where no baby of the age that this one was supposed to be has a right to have any. Its arms and hands were thin and bony. It looked weak and sick, but it was rolling and wriggling about in the liveliest way. It would give a spring as if it were going straight off the bed upon the floor, and when poor Ellen caught at it to save it, it would roll back toward her, stop its crying for a second, and seem to be laughing at her, and then it would do the same thing again.“It’s plain enough,” Mrs. O’Brien said, as soon as she saw it. “It’s one of the Good People. But it’s quick enough we’ll be rid of it and have back your own child. Bring me some eggs.”“I’ll have nothing of the sort now,” said Ellen. “It’s bad the poor child is with some sickness or other, but it’s my own child, and I’ll have nothing done to it that’s not to do it good. If you know anything that’ll help it, Mrs. O’Brien, tell me that, but don’t be sayin’ it’s not my child.”“I’ll not hurt the child, whatever it is,” said Mrs. O’Brien, “but there are ways to tell whether it’s your own child at all or one of the Good People. If you find it’s one of them, then it’s easy to do more, but in the meantime it’s not harmed.”“I’ll not have you trying any of them things,” said Ellen. “I’ll not have you saying it’s not my child, and I’ll not be thinking of such a thing myself. You see how poor and sick it’s looking. If there’s anything you can do for the child, do it, but don’t be talking that way any more.”“Ellen,” said Mrs. O’Brien, “you don’t know what you’re talking about at all. Wait now till I tell you what was told to me when I lived in Dublin, and I think that it was not far from there that it happened. It’s about a woman that talked as you do. A sailor’s wife she was, and there was a child born to her while her husband was away at sea. She thought he’ld be home soon, and so she wanted to put off the christening of the child till he’ld be back. So she waited and waited for a long time, and her husband did not come. The neighbors told her she was doing wrong to wait so long and she ought to have the child christened before anything would happen to it. But she wouldn’t listen to them.“So it went on for a year and a half, and still the father didn’t come home. But the boy was healthy and happy, and the mother never had any trouble with him. But the trouble came. One day she’d been working in the field, and she came home, and as soon as she was in the house she heard crying from the bed where the child used to sleep. She ran to look at him, and he lay there, looking sick and thin and weak, the way your boy does, and crying that he was hungry. He was like her child and he was not like him. He’d grown so pale and bad-looking that she thought he’d had a stroke from the Good People. But she went to get him some bread and milk, and she asked her other boy, that was about seven years old, when it was and how it was that he began to be sick.“‘I left him playing near the fire,’ the boy said, ‘and I was in the other room. And I heard a rushing noise, like a great flock of birds flying down the chimney, and then I heard a cry from my brother and then again the noise, like the birds were flying out at the chimney again. And then I ran in and found him there the way you see him now.’“Well, if the poor woman had never had trouble with the child before, she had nothing but trouble now. Crying and squalling it was all the time, and it nearly ate her out of house and home, and yet it seemed always sick and weak and thin. The neighbors came and they told her it was not her child at all, but one of the Good People that had been put in the place of it, and it was all her own fault for not having it christened in the right time. But not a word of it all would she listen to, and she said all the time that, whatever was wrong with it, it was her own child and she’ld hear nothing to the contrary.“It was an out-of-the-way place where they lived, and there was no priest near, or she never could have kept it from being christened as long as she did. But at last the neighbors themselves said that if she didn’t see to it, they would. And they said to her: ‘It’s not your child at all that’s in it, and if you’ll have it christened you’ll see. And if you won’t take the child to the priest with us now, we’ll go to him ourselves and tell him all about it. It’s not right to keep it from him longer.’“So with that she thought it was no use and she’ld have to do as they said, and she took the child and tried to dress him, ready to take him to the priest to be christened. But the roars and the screams that he let out of him were more than anybody could bear, and at the last she said: ‘Oh, I can’t do it; it’s too terrible a thing for him; he won’t bear it, and how can I make him?’“The next day when she came in from her work the other boy said to her: ‘Mother, it was uncommon quiet he was while you was away to-day. And by and by I went in to see what was ailing him. And there he sat, looking so like an old man that I was near afraid of him. And he looked at me and he spoke as plain as an old man, and he says: “Pat,” says he, “bring me a pipe, till I have a bit of a smoke. It’s tired of life I am, lying here without it.”‘“‘”Ah,” says I, “wait till my mother gets home and I’ll tell her of this.”‘“‘”Tell her,” says he, “and she’ll not believe a word from you.”‘“‘And no more do I believe a word from you,’ says the woman.“Well, soon after that there came a letter from the father, saying that he’ld be at home now in a few days. With that the woman set off to town to buy things to eat and drink to welcome her husband home, and she said: ‘Now we’ll have the christening, as soon as ever he comes.’“Then as soon as she was off, the neighbors said: ‘Now is the time that we’ll be done with that imp. We’ll take him and have him christened while she’s away, and we’ll not give her the chance to put it off again because he cries.’“So they went to the house and one of the women came up to the bed and clapped a quilt over him and had him wrapped up in it before he knew what was happening to him, and away they all went down toward the brook, on the way to the priest. Well, he kicked and he struggled to get free, but the woman held him so tight it was no use. But when they came to the running water, it was then he began bellowing like a herd of bulls, and kicking and pulling so that it was all she could do to hold him.“She got her foot on the first of the stepping-stones, and it was then he began to get heavy, as if it was a stone that she was carrying. But she held hard and reached the second stone, and it seemed to her that he was nothing but a lump of lead, only still roaring and struggling; and, what with that and the rushing of the water below her, she began to get dizzy, but still she held on, and she had her foot on the stone in the middle of the stream when plump down he fell through the quilt that he was wrapped in, as if it had been nothing but a muslin handkerchief.“And there he went floating down the stream, and shouting and laughing at them. For, you know, it’s not being in running water that can hurt one of the Good People, but only crossing it, and if they tried to cross it they’ld be in awful pain till they got to the middle, and then nothing could keep them from falling in.“So they were rid of him, and you know when you’re rid of a changeling the Good People must send your own child back. And so the neighbors had not got back to the house when they met the mother running to meet them and bringing her own child, that she had found in its bed, when she got back from the town, sleeping, as well and as sound as ever it was.“And now, Ellen,” said Mrs. O’Brien, “will you let me try, in ways that I know, that can do no harm, whether this is your own child or not? And if it’s not, you’ll have your own back, as well as it was last night.”“This is my own child,” Ellen answered, “and it’s not by any silly tales like that that you can make me believe it isn’t. I’ll not have you doing anything of the sort. If you know anything that can help a baby when it’s sick, you may do that, but nothing else.”“I do know one thing that can help a sick baby,” Mrs. O’Brien answered “and that I’ll do, if you like it or not. If that thing there is one of the Good People, as I think, it’s not sick, and it will live for thousands of years after we are dead. We can neither help it nor much hurt it. But if that is your child, it doesn’t look to me as if it would live an hour. I’ll not try whether it’s yours or not, but if it’s yours I’ll not stand by and see its soul die, that ought to be the soul of a Christian. Ellen Sullivan, that child will be christened before I leave this house.”“Christened!” poor Ellen cried in amazement. “And who’s to christen him? We couldn’t get a priest here in an hour—maybe not to-day.”“There’s no need of a priest,” Mrs. O’Brien said; “I’ll christen him myself. Bring me some water there, Peter.”“But sure you can’t do that,” Peter protested. “Nobody but a priest could christen a child.”“I can christen the child as well as a priest,” said Mrs. O’Brien; “you take a child to the priest to be christened, when it’s easy and convenient, but when there’s no priest near, and the child is sick and seems likely to die before one can come, anybody can christen it; and that christening stands, and it never has to be christened after. That’s the law of the Church. Bring me the water. I never saw a child that seemed more likely to die than this one, if it’s a child at all.”And Peter brought the water.“What do you call the child?” Mrs. O’Brien asked.“I think we’ll call him Terence,” Peter answered. “That was my grandfather’s name, on my mother’s side, and a decent man he was, and uncommon fond of myself when I was a bit of a gossoon, till he died, Heaven rest his soul! and I think I’d like to name the boy after him.”Now all that the child had been doing and all the noise that he had been making before were simply nothing to what he had been doing ever since Mrs. O’Brien first said the word “christen.” He was screaming so that all this talk could scarcely be heard, and it was almost more than Mrs. O’Brien could do to hold him, when she took him in her arms. But she did hold him for a moment with one arm, while she dipped up some water with her hand and sprinkled it over him. Then the creature gave one great jump and was away from her and fell on the floor.Before anybody else could move, Mrs. O’Brien herself picked him up and laid him on the bed. There was no sign that he was hurt. No child that was hurt could have screamed as he did. “Come, John,” said Mrs. O’Brien, “we’ve done all that we can.”“May I walk back with you a piece?” said Peter. “There was something more that I was thinking I would say.”“Come back with us, of course, and welcome,” said John.They left the house and walked along the street.“I think it was right, what you done, Mrs. O’Brien,” said Peter. “I can’t think about the child the way you think, but it was right what you done.”Mrs. O’Brien made no answer. “John,” said Peter, “there’s something that I was thinking of last night and this morning, and it was this: You have a girl and I have a boy, that was both born on the one day. It’s good friends we’ve always been, and your father and your mother and my father and my mother before us. And I was just thinking when your girl and my boy grows up, supposing that they like each other well enough, it might be pleasant to all of us that they’ld be married some time.“There’s no man’s son that I’d rather see a daughter of mine married to than yours, Peter,” said John, “if she herself was pleased. I’ld not ask her to take anybody she didn’t like, but if she came to love him, and he came to love her, I’ld be as pleased as yourself.”“It was that I wanted to say,” said Peter, “and I’d better go back to Ellen now.”John and his mother said no more till they were at home. They both went into the room where little Kathleen was. Mrs. Mulvey sat watching the baby. She went out and left them. The child was sleeping as peacefully as if there were no such thing in the world as sorrow or loss or doubt, or a fairy to help or harm.“John,” said Mrs. O’Brien, “I’d think I might have done harm to that child in trying to christen it, only I’m as sure as ever I was of anything that it’s not a child at all, but one of the Good People, so I think there’s no harm done. I don’t know what would happen any of the Good People if he was to be rightly christened. I think he’ld not be able to stand it and would be driven out, so that they’ld have to send back the real child. Now, if a priest ever sees that creature that we’ve just seen, and asks: ‘Has this child been christened?’ they’ll have to answer ‘Yes,’ and he cannot be christened again. And yet, with the jump that he gave out of my arms when I sprinkled the water, it’s not sure I am that a drop of it touched him.”","['village', 'live', 'name', 'call', 'claus', 'four', 'horse',

1425,irish,The House in the Lake,"A long, long time ago, there lived in a little hut, in the midst of one of the inland lakes of Erin, an old fisherman and his son. The hut was built on stakes driven into the bed of the lake, and was so high above the waters that even when they were stirred into waves by the wind coming down from the mountains they did not reach the threshold of the door. Around, outside the hut, on a level with the floor, was a little wicker-work platform, and under the platform, close to the steps leading up to it from the water, the fisherman’s curragh, made of willows, covered with skins, was moored, and it was only by means of the curragh that he and his son, Enda, could leave their lake dwelling.On many a summer evening Enda lay stretched on the platform, watching the sunset fading from the mountain-tops, and the twilight creeping over the waters of the lake, and it chanced that once when he was so engaged he heard a rustle in a clump of sedge that grew close to one side of the hut. He turned to where the sound came from, and what should he see but an otter swimming towards him, with a little trout in his mouth. When the otter came up to where Enda was lying, he lifted his head and half his body from the water, and flung the trout on the platform, almost at Enda’s feet, and then disappeared.Enda took the little panting trout in his hand; but as he did so he heard, quite close to him, in the lake, a sound like that of water plashing upon water, and he saw the widening circles caused by a trout which had just risen to a fly; and he said to the little trout he held in his hand:“I won’t keep you, poor thing! Perhaps that was a little comrade come to look for you, and so I’ll send you back to him.”And saying this, he dropped the little trout into the lake.Well, when the next evening came, again Enda was lying stretched outside the hut, and once more he heard the rustle in the sedge, and once more the otter came and flung the little trout almost into his hands.Enda, more surprised than ever, did not know what to do. He saw that it was the same little trout the otter had brought him the night before, and he said:“Well, I gave you a chance last night. I’ll give you another, if only to see what will come of it.”And he dropped the trout into the lake; but no sooner had it touched the waters than it was changed into a beautiful, milk-white swan. And Enda could hardly believe his eyes, as he saw it sailing across the lake, until it was lost in the sedges growing by the shore.All that night he lay awake, thinking of what he had seen, and as soon as the morning stood on the hill-tops, and cast its shafts of golden light across the lake, Enda rose and got into his curragh.He rowed all round the shores, beating the sedges with his oar, in pursuit of the swan; but all in vain; he could not catch a glimpse of her white plumage anywhere. Day after day he rowed about the lake in search of her, and every evening he lay outside the hut watching the waters. At long last, one night, when the full moon, rising above the mountains, flooded the whole lake with light, he saw the swan coming swiftly towards him, shining brighter than the moonbeams. The swan came on until it was almost within a boat’s length of the hut; and what should Enda hear but the swan speaking to him in his own language:“Get into your curragh, Enda, and follow me,” said she, and, saying this, she turned round and sailed away.Illustration from Edmond Leamy’s Irish Fairy Tales (1906), M.A. Gill & Son. Ltd, Dublin.Enda jumped into the curragh, and soon the water, dripping from his oar, was flashing like diamonds in the moonlight. And he rowed after the swan, who glided on before him, until she came to where the shadows of the mountains lay deepest on the lake. Then the swan rested, and when Enda came up to her:“Enda,” said she, “I have brought you where none may hear what I wish to say to you. I am Mave, the daughter of the king of Erin. By the magic arts of my cruel stepmother I was changed into a trout, and cast into this lake a year and a day before the evening when you restored me to the waters the second time. If you had not done so the first night the otter brought me to you I should have been changed into a hooting owl; if you had not done so the second night, I should have been changed into a croaking raven. But, thanks to you, Enda, I am now a snow-white swan, and for one hour on the first night of every full moon the power of speech is and will be given to me as long as I remain a swan. And a swan I must always remain, unless you are willing to break the spell of enchantment that is over me; and you alone can break it.”“I’ll do anything I can for you. O princess!” said Enda. “But how can I break the spell?”“You can do so,” said the swan, “only by pouring upon my plumage the perfumed water that fills the golden bowl that is in the inmost room of the palace of the fairy queen, beneath the lake.”“And how can I get that?” said Enda.“Well,” said the swan, “you must dive beneath the lake, and walk along its bed, until you come to where the lake dragon guards the entrance of the fairy queen’s dominions.”“I can dive like a fish,” said Enda; “but how can I walk beneath the waters?”“You can do it easily enough,” said the swan, “if you get the water-dress of Brian, one of the three sons of Turenn, and his helmet of transparent crystal, by the aid of which he was able to walk under the green salt sea.”“And where shall I find them?”“They are in the water-palace of Angus of the Boyne,” said the swan; “but you should set out at once, for if the spell be not broken before the moon is full again, it cannot be broken for a year and a day.”“I’ll set out in the first ray of the morning,” said Enda.“May luck and joy go with you,” said the swan. “And now the hours of silence are coming upon me, and I have only time to warn you that dangers you little dream of will lie before you in your quest for the golden cup.”“I am willing to face all dangers for your sake, O princess,” said Enda.“Blessings be upon you, Enda,” said the swan, and she sailed away from the shadow out into the light across the lake to the sedgy banks. And Enda saw her no more.He rowed his curragh home, and he lay on his bed without taking off his clothes. And as the first faint glimmer of the morning came slanting down the mountains, he stepped into his curragh and pulled across the lake, and took the road towards the water-palace of Angus of the Boyne.When he reached the banks of the glancing river a little woman, dressed in red, was standing there before him.“You are welcome, Enda,” said she. “And glad am I to see the day that brings you here to help the winsome Princess Mave. And now wait a second, and the water-dress and crystal helmet will be ready for you.”And, having said this, the little woman plucked a handful of wild grasses, and she breathed upon them three times and then flung them on the river, and a dozen fairy nymphs came springing up through the water, bearing the water-dress and crystal helmet and a shining spear. And they laid them down upon the bank at Enda’s feet, and then disappeared.“Now, Enda,” said the fairy woman, “take these; by the aid of the dress and the helmet you can walk beneath the waters. You will need the spear to enable you to meet the dangers that lie before you. But with that spear, if you only have courage, you can overcome everything and everyone that may attempt to bar your way.”Having said this, she bid good-bye to Enda, and stepping off the bank, she floated out upon the river as lightly as a red poppy leaf. And when she came to the middle of the stream she disappeared beneath the waters.Enda took the helmet, dress, and spear, and it was not long until he came to the sedgy banks where his little boat was waiting for him. As he stepped into the curragh the moon was rising above the mountains. He rowed on until he came to the hut, and having moored the boat to the door, he put on the water-dress and the crystal helmet, and taking the spear in his hand, he leaped over the side of the curragh, and sank down and down until he touched the bottom. Then he walked along without minding where he was going, and the only light he had was the shimmering moonlight, which descended as faintly through the waters as if it came through muffled glass. He had not gone very far when he heard a horrible hissing, and straight before him he saw what he thought were two flaming coals.After a few more steps he found himself face to face with the dragon of the lake, the guardian of the palace of the fairy queen. Before he had time to raise his spear, the dragon had wound its coils around him, and he heard its horrible teeth crunching against the side of his crystal helmet, and he felt the pressure of its coils around his side, and the breath almost left his body; but the dragon, unable to pierce the helmet, unwound his coils, and soon Enda’s hands were free, and before the dragon could attempt to seize him again, he drove his spear through one of its fiery eyes, and, writhing with pain, the hissing dragon darted through a cave behind him. Enda, gaining courage from the dragon’s flight, marched on until he came to a door of dull brass set in the rocks. He tried to push it in before him, but he might as well have tried to push away the rocks. While he was wondering what he should do, he heard again the fierce hissing of the dragon, and saw the red glare of his fiery eye dimly in the water.Lifting his spear and hastily turning round to meet the furious monster, Enda accidently touched the door with the point of the spear, and the door flew open. Enda passed through, and the door closed behind him with a grating sound, and he marched along through a rocky pass which led to a sandy plain.As he stepped from the pass into the plain the sands began to move, as if they were alive. In a second a thousand hideous serpents, almost the colour of the sand, rose hissing up, and with their forked tongues made a horrible, poisonous hedge in front of him. For a second he stood dismayed, but then, levelling his spear, he rushed against the hedge of serpents, and they, shooting poison at him, sank beneath the sand. But the poison did not harm him, because of his water-dress and crystal helmet.When he had passed over the sandy plain, he had to climb a great steep, jagged rock. When he got to the top of the rock he saw spread out before him a stony waste without a tuft or blade of grass. At some distance in front of him he noticed a large dark object, which he took to be a rock, but on looking at it more closely he saw that it was a huge, misshapen, swollen mass, apparently alive. And it was growing bigger and bigger every moment. Enda stood amazed at the sight, and before he knew where he was the loathsome creature rose from the ground, and sprang upon him before he could use his spear, and, catching him in its horrid grasp, flung him back over the rocks on to the sandy plain. Enda was almost stunned, but the hissing of the serpents rising from the sand around him brought him to himself, and, jumping to his feet, once more he drove them down beneath the surface.Illustration from Edmond Leamy’s Irish Fairy Tales (1906), M.A. Gill & Son. Ltd, Dublin.He then approached the jagged rock, on the top of which he saw the filthy monster glaring at him with bloodshot eyes. Enda poised his spear and hurled it against his enemy. It entered between the monster’s eyes, and from the wound the blood flowed down like a black torrent and dyed the plain, and the shrunken carcase slipped down the front of the rocks and disappeared beneath the sand. Enda once more ascended the rock, and without meeting or seeing anything he passed over the stony waste, and at last he came to a leafy wood. He had not gone far in the wood until he heard the sound of fairy music, and walking on he came upon a mossy glade, and there he found the fairies dancing around their queen. They were so small, and were all so brightly dressed, that they looked like a mass of waving flowers; but when he was seen by them they vanished like a glorious dream, and no one remained before him but the fairy queen. The queen blushed at finding herself alone, but on stamping her little foot three times upon the ground, the frightened fairies all crept back again.“You are welcome, Enda,” said the queen. “My little subjects have been alarmed by your strange dress and crystal helmet. I pray you take them off; you do not need them here.”Enda did as he was bidden, and he laid down his water-dress and helmet on the grass, and the little fairies, seeing him in his proper shape, got over their fright, and, unrestrained by the presence of the queen, they ran tumbling over one another to try and get a good look at the crystal helmet.“I know what you have come for, Enda,” said the queen. “The golden cup you shall have to-morrow; but to-night you must share our feast, so follow me to the palace.”Having said this, the queen beckoned her pages to her, and, attended by them and followed by Enda, she went on through the wood. When they had left it behind them Enda saw on a green hill before him the snow-white palace of the fairy queen.As the queen approached the steps that led up to the open door, a band of tiny fairies, dressed in rose-coloured silk, came out, carrying baskets of flowers, which they flung down on the steps to make a fragrant carpet for her. They were followed by a band of harpers dressed in yellow silken robes, who ranged themselves on each side of the steps and played their sweetest music as the queen ascended.When the queen, followed by Enda, entered the palace, they passed through a crystal hall that led to a banquet-room. The room was lighted by a single star, large as a battle-shield. It was fixed against the wall above a diamond throne.The queen seated herself upon the throne, and the pages, advancing towards her, and bending low, as they approached the steps, handed her a golden wand.The queen waved the wand three times, and a table laden with all kinds of delicacies appeared upon the floor. Then she beckoned Enda to her, and when he stood beside her the fairy table was no higher than his knee.“I am afraid I must make you smaller, Enda,” said the queen, “or you will never be able to seat yourself at my fairy table.”And having said this, she touched Enda with the golden wand, and at once he became as small as her tallest page. Then she struck the steps of her throne, and all the nobles of her court, headed by her bards, took their places at the festive board.The feast went on right merrily, and when the tiny jewelled drinking-cups were placed upon the table, the queen ordered the harpers to play.And the little harpers struck the chords, and as Enda listened to the music it seemed to him as if he was being slowly lifted from his seat, and when the music ended the fairies vanished, the shining star went out, and Enda was in perfect darkness.The air blew keenly in his face, and he knew not where he was. At last he saw a faint grey light, and soon this light grew broader and brighter, and as the shadows fled before it, he could hardly believe his eyes when he found himself in his curragh on the lake, and the moonlight streaming down from the mountain-tops.For a moment he thought he must have been dreaming; but there in the boat before him were the crystal helmet, and the water-dress, and the gleaming spear, and the golden bowl of perfumed water that was to remove the spell of enchantment from the white swan of the lake, and sailing towards him from the sedgy bank came the snow-white swan; and when she touched the boat, Enda put out his hands and lifted her in, and then over her plumage he poured the perfumed water from the golden bowl, and the Princess Mave in all her maiden beauty stood before him.“Take your oar, Enda,” she said, “and row to the southern bank.”Enda seized his oar, and the curragh sped across the waters swifter than a swallow in its flight. When the boat touched the shore Enda jumped out, and lifted the princess on to the bank.“Send your boat adrift, Enda,” she said; “but first take out your shining spear; the water-dress and the crystal helmet will take care of themselves.”Enda took out the spear, and then pushed the boat from the bank. It sped on towards the hut in the middle of the lake; but before it had reached halfway six nymphs sprang up from the water and seizing the helmet and dress, sank with them beneath the tide, and the boat went on until it pushed its prow against the steps of the little hut, where it remained.Then Enda and the princess turned towards the south, and it was not long until they came to a deep forest, that was folding up its shadows and spreading out its mossy glades before the glancing footsteps of the morning. They had not gone far through the forest when they heard the music of hounds and the cries of huntsmen, and crashing towards them through the low branches they saw a fierce wild boar. Enda, gently pushing the princess behind him, levelled his spear, and when the boar came close to him he drove it into his throat. The brute fell dead at his feet, and the dogs rushing up began to tear it to pieces. The princess fainted at the sight, and while Enda was endeavouring to restore her, the king of Erin, followed by his huntsmen, appeared, and when the king saw the princess he started in amazement, as he recognised the features of his daughter Mave.At that moment the princess came to herself, and her father, lifting her tenderly in his arms, kissed her again and again.“I have mourned you as dead, my darling,” said he, “and now you are restored to me more lovely than ever. I would gladly have given up my throne for this. But say who is the champion who has brought you hither, and who has slain the wild boar we have hunted so many years in vain?”The princess blushed like a rose as she said:“His name is Enda, father; it is he has brought me back to you.”Then the king embraced Enda and said:“Forgive me, Enda, for asking any questions about you before you have shared the hospitality of my court. My palace lies beyond the forest, and we shall reach it soon.”Then the king ordered his huntsman to sound the bugle-horn, and all his nobles galloped up in answer to it, and when they saw the Princess Mave they were so dazzled by her beauty that they scarcely gave a thought to the death of the wild boar.“It is my daughter, Mave, come back to me,” said the king.And all the nobles lowered their lances, and bowed in homage to the lady.“And there stands the champion who has brought her home,” said the king, pointing to Enda.The nobles looked at Enda, and bowed courteously, but in their hearts they were jealous of the champion, for they saw he was already a favourite of the king’s.Then the pages came up, leading milk-white steeds with golden bridles, and the king, ordering Enda to mount one of them, lifted Mave on to his own, and mounted behind her. The pages, carrying the boar’s head on a hollow shield, preceded by the huntsmen sounding their horns, set out towards the palace, and the royal party followed them.As the procession approached the palace crowds came rushing out to see the trophies of the chase, and through the snow-white door the queen, Mave’s cruel stepmother, attended by her maids-of-honour and the royal bards, came forth to greet the king. But when she saw seated before him the Princess Mave, who she thought was at the bottom of the lake under a spell of enchantment, she uttered a loud cry, and fell senseless to the ground.Illustration from Edmond Leamy’s Irish Fairy Tales (1906), M.A. Gill & Son. Ltd, Dublin.The king jumped from his horse, and rushing to the queen, lifted her up and carried her in his arms to her apartments, for he had no suspicion of the wickedness of which she had been guilty.And the court leeches were summoned to attend her, but she died that very night, and it was not until a green mound, worthy of a queen of Erin, had been raised over her grave that the Princess Mave told her father of the wickedness of her stepmother. And when she told him the whole story of how Enda had broken the spell of enchantment, and of the dangers which he had faced for her sake, the king summoned an assembly of all his nobles, and seated on his throne, wearing his golden helmet, the bards upon his right hand and the Druids upon his left, and the nobles in ranks before him with gleaming helmets and flashing spears, he told them the story of the princess, and of the service which Enda had rendered to her.“And now,” said the king, “if the princess is willing to take her deliverer for her husband, I am willing that she shall be his bride; and if you, my subjects, Bards and Druids and Nobles and Chiefs of Erin, have anything to say against this union, speak. But first, Mave,” said the king, as he drew the blushing princess to him, “speak, darling, as becomes the daughter of a king––speak in the presence of the nobles of Erin, and say if it is your wish to become Enda’s bride.”The princess flung her white arms around her father’s neck, as she murmured:“Father, it was Enda brought me back to you, and before all the princes and nobles of Erin I am willing to be his bride.”And she buried her head upon the king’s breast, and as he stroked her silken hair falling to her feet, the bards struck their golden harps, but the sound of the joyous music could hardly drown the murmurs of the jealous nobles.When the music ceased the king beckoned Enda to him, and was about to place his hand in Mave’s when a Druid, whose white beard almost touched the ground, and who had been a favourite of the dead stepmother, and hated Mave for her sake, stepped forward and said:“O King of Erin, never yet has the daughter of a king been freely given in marriage to any save a battle champion; and that stripling there has never struck his spear against a warrior’s shield.”A murmur of approbation rose from the jealous princes, and Congal, the bravest of them all, stepped out from the ranks, and said:“The Druid speaks the truth, O king! That stripling has never faced a battle champion yet, and, speaking for all the nobles of your land, I challenge him to fight any one of us; and as he is young and unused to arms, we are willing that the youngest and least experienced amongst us should be set against him.”When Congal had spoken, the nobles, in approval of his words, struck their shields with their swords, and the brazen sound ascended to the skies.The face of the princess, blushing a moment before like a rose, became as white as a lily; but the colour returned to her cheeks when she heard Enda’s voice ringing loud and clear.“It is true, O king!” said he, “that I have never used my spear in battle yet. The Prince Congal has challenged me to meet the youngest and least experienced of the chiefs of Erin. I have risked my life already for your daughter’s sake. I would face death a thousand times for the chance of winning her for my bride; but I would scorn to claim her hand if I dared not meet the boldest battle champion of the nobles of Erin, and here before you, O king, and bards, Druids, and nobles, and chiefs of Erin, and here, in the presence of the Lady Mave, I challenge the boldest of them all.”The king’s eyes flashed with joy as he listened to the brave words of Enda.“It is well,” said the king; “the contest shall take place to-morrow on the lawn outside our palace gates; but before our assembly dissolves I call on you, nobles and chiefs of Erin, to name your boldest champion.”Loud cries of “Congal! Congal!” answered the king’s speech.“Are you willing, Congal?” asked the king.“Willing, O king!” answered Congal.“It is well,” said the king. “We shall all meet again to-night in our banquet-hall.”And the king, with the Princess Mave on his arm, attended by his bards and Druids, entered the palace, and the chiefs and nobles went their several ways.At the feast that night the princess sat beside the king, and Enda beside the princess, and the bards and Druids, nobles and chiefs, took their places in due order. And the bards sang songs of love and battle, and never merrier hours were spent than those which passed away that night in the banquet-hall of Erin’s king.When the feast was over Enda retired to his apartment to spend the night dreaming of the Princess Mave, and Congal went to his quarters; but not to sleep or dream, for the Druid who had provoked the contest came to him bringing his golden wand, and all night long the Druid was weaving spells to charm the shield and spear and helmet of Congal, to make them invulnerable in the battle of the morrow.But while Enda lay dreaming of the Princess Mave, the little fairy woman who gave him the water-dress, and crystal helmet, and shining spear on the banks of the Boyne, slid into his room, and she placed beside his couch a silver helmet and a silver shield. And she rubbed the helmet, and the shield, and the blue blade and haft of his spear with the juice of the red rowan berries, and she let a drop fall upon his face and hands, and then she slid out as silently as she came.When the morning broke, Enda sprang from his couch, and he could hardly believe his eyes when he saw the silver shield and helmet. At the sight of them he longed for the hour of battle, and he watched with eager gaze the sun climbing the sky; and, after hours of suspense, he heard the trumpet’s sound and the clangour of the hollow shields, struck by the hard-pointed spears.Putting on the helmet, and fastening the shield upon his left arm, and taking the spear in his right hand, he stepped out bravely to the fight. The edge of the lawn before the palace gates was ringed by the princes, nobles, and chiefs of Erin. And the palace walls were thronged by all the beauties of the Court and all the noble ladies of the land. And on his throne, surrounded by his Druids, his brehons, and his bards, was the king of Erin, and at his feet sat the lovely Lady Mave.As Enda stepped out upon the lawn, he saw Congal advancing from the ranks of the nobles, and the two champions approached each other until they met right in front of the throne.Then both turned towards the throne, and bowed to the king and the Princess Mave; and then facing each other again, they retired a space, and when their spears were poised, ready for battle, the king gave the signal, which was answered by the clang of stricken shields, and Congal and Enda launched their gleaming spears. They flashed like lightning in the sunlit air, and in a second Congal’s had broken against Enda’s shield; but Enda’s, piercing Congal’s helmet, hurled him senseless on the plain.The nobles and chiefs could hardly realize that in that single second their boldest champion was overthrown; but when they saw him stretched motionless on the grassy sward, from out their ranks six warriors advanced to where the chieftain lay, and sadly they bore him away upon their battle-shields, and Enda remained victor upon the field.And then the king’s voice rang out clear as the sound of a trumpet in the still morning:“Bards and brehons, princes and nobles, and chiefs of Erin, Enda has proved himself a battle champion, and who amongst you now will dare gainsay his right to claim my daughter for his bride?”And no answer came.But when he summoned Enda to his throne, and placed the lady’s hand in his, a cheer arose from the great assembly, that proved that jealousy was extinguished in all hearts, and that all believed that Enda was worthy of the winsome bride; and never since that day, although a thousand years have passed, was there in all the world a brighter and joyous wedding than the wedding of Enda and the Princess Mave.","['long', 'blackfoot', 'indian', 'dwelt', 'canadian', 'plain', 'great', 'famine', 'land', 'many', 'month', 'buffalo', 'kill', 'meat', 'price', 'people', 'drop',

1429,irish,"The Three Daughters of the King of the East, and the Son of a King in Erin","There was once a king in Erin, and he had an only son. While this son was a little child his mother died.After a time the king married and had a second son.The two boys grew up together; and as the elder was far handsomer and better than the younger, the queen became jealous, and was for banishing him out of her sight.The king’s castle stood near the shore of Loch Erne, and three swans came every day to be in the water and swim in the lake. The elder brother used to go fishing; and once when he sat at the side of the water, the three swans made young women of themselves, came to where he sat, and talked to the king’s son.The queen had a boy minding cows in the place, and when he went home that night he told about what he had seen,—that there were three young women at the lake, and the king’s son was talking to the three that day. Next morning the queen called the cowboy to her, and said: “Here is a pin of slumber; and do you stick it in the clothes of the king’s son before the young women come, and when they go away, take out the pin and bring it back to me.”That day when the cowboy saw the three young women coming, he went near and threw the pin, which stuck in the clothes of the king’s son. That instant he fell asleep on the ground.When the young women came, one of them took a towel, dipped it in the cold water of the lake, and rubbed his face; but she could not rouse him. When their time came to go, they were crying and lamenting because the young man was asleep; and one of the three put a gold pin in his bosom, so that when he woke up he would find it and keep her in mind.After they had gone a couple of hours, the cowboy came up, took out the sleeping-pin, and hurried off. The king’s son woke up without delay; and finding the gold pin in his bosom, he knew the young woman had come to see him.Next day he fished and waited again. When the cowboy saw the young women coming out of the lake, he stole up a second time, and threw the pin, which stuck in his clothes, and that moment he was drowsy and fell asleep. When the young women came he was lying on the ground asleep. One of them rubbed him with a towel dipped in the water of the lake; but no matter what she did, he slept on, and when they had to go, she put a gold ring in his bosom. When the sisters were leaving the lake, and had put on their swan-skins and become swans, they all flew around him and flapped their wings in his face to know could they rouse him; but there was no use in trying.After they had gone, the cowboy came and took out the sleeping-pin. When the king’s son was awake he put his hand in his bosom, found the keepsake, and knew that the sisters had come to him.When he went fishing the third day, he called up the cowboy and said: “I fall asleep every day. I know something is done to me. Now do you tell me all. In time I’ll reward you well. I know my stepmother sends something by you that takes my senses away.”“I would tell,” said the cowboy, “but I’m in dread my mistress might kill or banish me.”“She will not, for I’ll put you in the way she’ll not harm you. You see my fishing-bag here? Now throw the pin, which I know you have, towards me, and hit the bag.”The cowboy did as he was told, and threw the pin into the fishing-bag, where it remained without harm to any one. The cowboy went back to his cattle, and the prince fished on as before. The three swans were out in the middle of the lake swimming around for themselves in the water, and the prince moved on, fishing, till he came to a bend in the shore. On one side of him a tongue of land ran out into the lake. The swans came to the shore, leaving the piece of land between themselves and the prince. Then they took off their swan-skins, were young women, and bathed in the lake.After that they came out, put on the dress of young women, and went to where the king’s son was fishing.He spoke to them, and asked where were they from, in what place were they born, and why were they swans.They said: “We are three sisters, daughters of the king of the East, and we have two brothers. Our mother died, and our father married again, and had two other daughters; and these two are not so good looking nor so well favored as we, and their mother was in dread they wouldn’t get such fine husbands as we, so she enchanted us, and now we are going about the world from lake to lake in the form of swans.”Then the eldest of the three sisters said to the king’s son: “What kind are you, and where were you born?”“I was born in Erin,” said he; “and when I was a little boy my mother died, my father married again and had a second son, and that son wasn’t to the eye what I was, and my stepmother was for banishing me from my father’s house because she thought her own son was not so good as I was, and I am fishing here every day by the lake to keep out of her sight.”“Well,” said the eldest sister, “I thought you were a king’s son, and so I came to you in my own form to know could we go on in the world together.”“I don’t know yet what to do,” said the king’s son.“Well, be sure of your mind to-morrow, for that will be the last day for me here.”When the cowboy was going home, the king’s son gave him the sleeping-pin for the stepmother. When he had driven in the cattle, the cowboy told the queen that the young man had fallen asleep as on the two other days.But there was an old witch in the place who was wandering about the lake that day. She saw everything, went to the queen, and told her how the three swans had made young women of themselves, and talked with her stepson.When the queen heard the old witch, she fell into a terrible rage at the cowboy for telling her a lie, and banished him out of her sight forever. Then she got another cowboy, and sent him off with the sleeping-pin next day. When he came near the lake, the king’s son tried to drive him off; but the cowboy threw the sleeping-pin into his clothes, and he fell down near the edge of the water without sight or sense.The three sisters came, and found him sleeping. They rubbed him, and threw water on his face, but they could not wake him. And the three were lamenting sorely, for they had brought a swan’s skin with them that day, so the king’s son might make a swan of himself and fly away with them, for this was their last day at that place; but they could do nothing now, for he lay there dead asleep on the ground before them.The eldest sister pulled out her handkerchief, and the falling tears dropped on it. Then she took a knife, and cut one of the nipples from her breast. The second sister wrote on the handkerchief: “Keep this in mind till you get more account from us.” They put it in his bosom and went away.As soon as the sisters had gone, the cowboy came, drew out the pin, and hurried away. The stepmother was always trying to banish the king’s son, hoping that something might happen to him, and her own son be the heir. So now he went off and wandered away through Erin, always inquiring for the eldest sister, but never could find her.At the end of seven years he came home, and was fishing at the side of Loch Erne again, when a swan flew up to him and said: “Your love is lying on her death-bed, unless you go to save her. She is bleeding from the breast, and you must go to her now. Go straight to the East!”The king’s son went straight to the East, and on the way there rose up storm and fog against him; but they did not stop him. He was going on always, and when he was three weeks’ journey from his father’s castle he stumbled one dark, misty day and fell over a ditch. When he rose up there stood on the other side of the ditch before him a little horse, all bridled and saddled, with a whip on the saddle. The horse spoke up and said: “If you are the king’s son, I was sent here to meet you, and carry you to the castle of the king of the East. There is a young woman at the castle who thinks it long till she sees you. Now ask me no questions, for I’m not at liberty to talk to you till I bring you to the East.”“I suppose we are to be a long time going?” said the king’s son.“Don’t trouble yourself about the going; I’ll take you safely. Sit on my back now, and be sure you’re a good rider, and you’ll not be long on the road. This is my last word.”They went on, and were going always; and as he travelled, the prince met the wind that was before him, and the wind that blew behind could not come up with him. When he was hungry the pommel of the saddle opened, and he found the best of eating inside.They went on sweeping over the world for two weeks, and when they were near the East the horse said: “Get down from my back now, for it’s tired I am.”“How far are we from the castle?” asked the king’s son.“Five days’ journey,” answered the horse. “When you come to the castle, don’t stop a moment till you ask where the young woman is lying; and tell them to be sure to give good stabling and food to the horse. Come and see me yourself every day. If you don’t, there will be nothing for me but fasting; and that’s what I don’t like.”When the king’s son came to the castle it was evening. The two younger sisters welcomed him. (These were two of the swans at the lake in Erin, and now at home by the enchantment of their stepmother. They were swans in the daytime, and women only at night, so as not to be under the eye of young men when these came to see the stepmother’s own daughters.) They said: “Our sister is on an island, and we’ll go to her.” They got a boat for the young man, and went with him to where their sister was lying. They said to her: “The son of the king of Erin is here.”“Let him come in, that I may look at him,” said she.The king’s son went in, and when she saw him she was glad. “Have you anything that belongs to me?” asked she.“Then throw it on my breast.”He threw the handkerchief on her breast and went away. Next day she rose from the bed as well as ever. On the third day after his arrival, the son of the king of Erin married the eldest daughter of the king of the East, and the stepmother’s enchantment was destroyed; and there was the grandest wedding that ever was seen in that kingdom.The king’s son, thinking only of his bride, forgot all about the horse that had brought him over the long road. When at last he went to see him, the stable was empty; the horse had gone. And neither his father in Erin nor the stepmother came to his mind, he was living so pleasantly in the East. But after he had been there a long time, and a son and a daughter had been born to him, he remembered his father. Then he made up his mind not to let the stepmother’s son be heir to the kingdom in place of himself. So taking his wife and children, he left the East and travelled to Erin. He stopped on the road, and sent word to the father that he was coming.When the stepmother heard the news, a great weakness came on her. She fell into a fit and died.The king’s son waited in a convenient place till the funeral was over, and then he came to the castle and lived with his father. He was not long in the place when he sent messengers to know could they find the cowboy that the stepmother banished for telling about the sleeping-pin. They brought the cowboy to the castle, and the king made him his coachman.The cowboy was not twelve months in his new place before he married. Then the king’s son gave him a fine piece of land to live on, with six cows and four horses. There was not a happier man in the kingdom than the cowboy. When the father died, the king’s son became king in Erin himself.","['many', 'year', 'great', 'famine', 'throughout', 'land', 'people', 'starve', 'crop', 'fail', 'entirely', 'plantain', 'bear',

1454,irish,The Big Poor People,"There was a knock at the door, and John opened it. “God save all here except the cat!” said a voice outside.“God save you kindly!” John answered.A young man and a young woman came in. They were neighbors—Peter Sullivan and his wife, Ellen. “Good avenin’ to you, Pether,” said John; “you’re lookin’ fine and hearty, and it’s like a rose you’re lookin’, Ellen.”“It’s more like nettles than roses we’re feelin’,” Ellen answered, “but something with prickles anyway, wid the bother we have every day and all day.”“Thrue for you, it’s hard times,” said John; “we was speaking about them just the minute before you came in; but we all have to bear them. It’s not you ought to complain, as long as you’ve good health; now here’s Kitty—I dunno how—”“It’s not the hard times I’m speakin’ of now,” said Ellen; “they’re bad enough, goodness knows; but it’s the bother we have all the time, and we can’t tell how or why. Half the time the cow gives no milk, and when she does, you can make no butther wid it. The pig, the crathur, won’t get fat; he ates everything he can reach, and still he looks like a basket wid a skin over it. The smoke of the fire comes down the chimney, the dishes are thrown on the floor, wid nobody near them, and such noises are goin’ on all night long that never a wink of sleep can a body get. What we’ll do at all if it goes on, I dunno.”“By all the books that ever was opened and shut,” Peter added, “it’s all thrue what she says, and more. What wid all that and what wid the throubles that’s on the whole counthry, if I only had the money saved to do it, I’ld lave it all to-morrow and go to the States—I would so.”“Leave off the things you do that make you all these troubles,” said the older Mrs. O’Brien, “and you’ll have no more need to go to the States than others.”“What things are them that we do?” Ellen asked.“Haven’t I told you before this,” said Mrs. O’Brien, “that it’s the Good People that trouble you? If you’ld treat them well, as we do, they’ld never bother you. If you’ld even take good care never to harm them, it’s likely they’ld never come near you.”“It’s the fairies you’re speakin’ of,” said Peter. “Sure I don’t believe in them at all. It’s old woman’s nonsense that your head’s full of, savin’ your presence, Mrs. O’Brien. There’s no fairies at all. Don’t talk to me.”“You’ld better be more respectful to them, Peter,” Mrs. O’Brien answered. “Say less about not believing in them and don’t call them by that name, that they don’t like. Call them ‘the Good People’ or ‘the gentry.’ They don’t like the name that you called them, any more than they like those who disbelieve in them or those who try to know too much about them. Speak well about them and treat them well, as we do, and they’ll not trouble you; maybe they’ll even help you. Didn’t you see, as you came in, how we left something for them to eat and drink outside the door there? We’ve not much, but they like fresh milk and clean water, and we always give them these, and they hold nothing but friendliness for us. Look and see now if they’ve taken what we left there for them after supper.”Peter went to the door and looked. “There’s nothing in the dishes there,” he said; “but how do we know it wasn’t the pig that ate it, or some poor dog, maybe?”“You don’t know,” said Mrs. O’Brien, “only as I tell you, and you’ld better be attending to them that know more than yourself. If you did chance to give a meal to some poor dog, instead of to the Good People, there’ld be no great harm done, but it’s the Good People that get what we put there. We always leave it for them and they always come and take it, and it’s that makes them friendly, and so they would be to you, if you did the same. But you do nothing for them, because you say you don’t believe in them, and you do worse than nothing. Didn’t I see Ellen the other evening throwing out some dirty water and never saying ‘Take care of the water?'”“And what if I did?” said Ellen. “Can’t I throw out wather when I plase, widout talkin’ about it?”“You can if you like,” said the old woman, “but when you throw out water without warning, it’s as likely as not some of the Good People may be passing, and they don’t like dirty water to be thrown on them; and so after that your cow gives no milk, your pig is thin, and your dishes are thrown around the room. Do as you like with your water, or with anything else, but if you anger the Good People, be sure they’ll do you harm.”“It’s superstitious you are. Mrs. O’Brien,” said Peter; “I dunno what it is that’s throubling us, but there’s no fairies at all.”“Superstitious, is it?” said the old woman. “And so you’re not superstitious at all, and you don’t believe in the Good People! Now tell me, Peter Sullivan, when you came to that door just now and said ‘God save all here,’ like a decent man, why did you add ‘except the cat?’ What did you mean by those words ‘except the cat?’ Tell me that now.”“Why, sure, Mrs. O’Brien,” Peter answered, just a bit confused, “sure, we’re told that cats is avil spirits, so we mustn’t put blessings on them, and when we say ‘God save all here,’ we add onto it ‘except the cat,’ so as not to be calling down a blessing on an avil spirit.”“Ah!” said Mrs. O’Brien, “it’s not the likes of you that’s superstitious. You can’t put a blessing on the poor cat, when you’re blessing everybody and everything else in the house, for fear you’ld be putting it on an evil spirit; but you’re not superstitions, and so you throw dirty water on the Good People as they’re passing, and you call them by names that they don’t like, and then you wonder what it is that’s troubling you.”“No, Mrs. O’Brien,” said Peter, again, “I dunno what it is at all. It may be the avil spirits themselves, for what I know, and whatever it is. I’ld go away and leave it and leave the country, if I had the money to get to the States. I heard once of a man that was druv out of the counthry by a monsther that I suppose was maybe something like the fairies—like them in making trouble for the man, anyway. It was a great conger that lived in a hole in the Sligo River, and I suppose he was ten yards long, and the man was a diver. He was gettin’ stones out of the bottom of the river, and the conger says to him, ‘What are you afther there?’ says he. ‘Stones, sor,’ says the diver. ‘Hadn’t you betther be goin?’ says the conger. ‘I think so, sor,’ says the diver, and afther that he never stopped goin’ till he got to the States.”“That’s you, Peter,” said the old woman; “you don’t believe in the Good People or strange monsters or anything of the sort, but you want to run away from them.”If Peter had been quite honest about it, he could scarcely have said, even to himself, whether he believed that there were any fairies or not; but he was really afraid of them, though he put on such a bold front and said that he did not believe in them, to make people think that he was uncommonly knowing. “Mrs. O’Brien,” he said, “do you think it’s true, what they say, that in the States you can pick up goold everywhere in the streets?”“What good would it do you if it was true?” she asked.“What good would it do me? Are ye askin’ what good would goold do me? Sure, then, wouldn’t I pick up all of it I could carry, and wouldn’t I take land wid it and pay rent and buy stock for a big farm and grow as rich as Damer? What good would goold be? Ha! Ha! What couldn’t you do in a country where ye could be pickin’ up goold in the street?”“There’s no gold to be picked up in the streets there, any more than here,” said the old woman, “and if there was, it would be no use to you. Only suppose, now, that you had picked up all the gold you could carry, and that you wanted to buy a loaf of bread with it. And suppose you went into a baker’s shop and chose even the smallest loaf of bread you could find, and threw down a whole gold sovereign for it—aye, or a hundred gold sovereigns. Would the baker sell you the bread for your gold, do you think? Wouldn’t he say to you: ‘Go on out of this, for the silly Irishman that you are! What for would I be giving you good bread for that gold of yours, when I can pick up as much and as good as that any minute here before my own door and keep my bread as well?’ If you could find gold in the street, it would be worth no more than the stones that you find there.”“I don’t know how that is, Mrs. O’Brien,” said Peter, “but I can’t see why goold wouldn’t be goold, wherever you could find it.”“It’s not sensible,” said John, “to be talkin’ of findin’ gold in the streets, but there’s a deal in what Peter says, for all that, and it’s often I’ve thought, too, that I’ld go to the States and be away from all these throubles, if only we could save up the money to take us all there. It’s not any gold or any riches I’m thinkin’ about, but what I want to know, mother, is this: Could a man in the States, if he was strong and if he worked hard—and if he didn’t drink a great deal—could he make enough to keep himself and his wife both, so that she needn’t work too hard—not so that she would sit idle, I don’t mean, but so that she needn’t be doin’ hard work and doin’ it all the time—could he do that?”“That’s the sensible and the honest talk,” said his mother; “he could do that. Those that do nothing get nothing, in the States the same as anywhere else. But I’ve talked with them that know, and they tell me that in the States those that will work are paid for their work, and those that are strong and industrious and honest can keep their families from want, and that’s more than some can do here, God help them!”“It would be a great thing,” said John, speaking slowly, as if he were trying to make himself believe this dream of a land where a man’s work could make his wife and his children sure of a home and food—”a great thing. And do you think, mother—but no, no—I suppose not—do you think, if we was once there—do you think that I could work enough to make it so that it would be easier for you and for Kitty both? Could one do enough for three?”“It would be easier than here, maybe,” was all that the old woman said in answer to this. She had heard this talk of America many times before, and she did not like it. She would rather believe, and make others believe, that better times were coming for Ireland. She was not so young as the others and not so ready to leave her old home, yet lately she had seen how it was growing harder and harder to stay, and there seemed to be little left of the good luck of which she boasted.She was thinking of all this now, and John knew her thoughts, though she did not speak them, and he said: “You always tell us that there’s betther times comin’, mother, and I’ve learned to know that all you say is true. She was sayin’ it just before you came in, Pether. But how can we believe in the betther times? They don’t come. They get worse and worse. How do we know they’ll ever come?”Again Mrs. O’Brien seemed lost in deep thought, or in a dream, just as when, a little while before, she had told them of O’Donoghue. What she told them now was a sort of answer to John’s question, but perhaps she told it quite as much to draw their thoughts away from America. She was silent for a little while, and they all waited for her to speak.“Good times for Ireland there will be again,” she said, “when Earl Gerald comes back. It was hundreds of years ago that Earl Gerald lived in his great castle of Mullaghmast. He was a strong warrior and he fought many a good fight for his people against their foes. More than that, he was powerful in magic. He could work mighty charms and he could change himself into any form he liked.“His wife knew that he could do this, but he had never shown himself to her in any form but his own. She often begged him to let her see what his magic could do, and to change himself to some other form for her. But he knew there was danger in it, and he put her off with one reason and another. But at last, she asked him so many times, he told her that if she took any fright at all while he was in any form but his own he could never live in the world again in his own form till all the people of the country had passed away many times. ‘I’ld not be a fit wife for you,’ she said, ‘if I’ld be easily frightened.’“‘You might not be easily frightened,’ he said, ‘but you might have great cause, and if you were only a little frightened you would never see me like myself again.’“Then one day, as they were sitting together, the Earl turned away his head and muttered some words which his wife could not understand, and that instant he was gone, and instead of him sitting beside her she saw a little goldfinch flying around the room. The goldfinch flew out at the window into the garden; then it flew back and sat on the lady’s shoulder and on her hand and on her head, and it sang to her, and so they played together for a time. Then it flew out into the open air once more, but in a second it darted back through the window and straight into the lady’s bosom. The next instant she saw a wild hawk, that was chasing the little bird and was coming straight through the window after it. She put both her hands over her bosom, to save her husband’s life, but she was frightened and she gave one scream as the hawk darted into the room, dashed itself against a table, and was killed. Then she looked where the little bird had been, and it was gone. She never saw Earl Gerald again.“But Earl Gerald was not dead, and he is not dead, though all this was hundreds of years ago. He is sleeping, down under the ground, just beneath where his old castle used to stand. His warriors are there with him. They are in a great hall. The Earl sits at the head of a long table and the men sit down the sides. All rest their heads upon the table and all are asleep. Against the wall there are rows of stalls, and behind each man, in one of the stalls, is his horse.“Once in every seven years Earl Gerald wakes at night. He rises and mounts his horse. A door of the hall opens. He rides out into the free air. He rides around the Curragh of Kildare and then back into the cave, to sleep again for seven years.“While he is out the door is open. Once, long ago, a horse-dealer was going home late, and he had been drinking a little. He saw the door in the hill open and he walked in. And there he found himself in a hall, dim and high. A row of dim lamps hung along the hall, and he saw the smoke of them rise up to the roof, where many old banners, faded and torn, stirred a little in the light breeze that came in by the open door. And the light of the lamps shone down and glistened on the bright armor of rows of men who sat with their steel helmets bowed upon the table, and behind them were rows of horses, with their saddles and their bridles on, ready for their riders.“There was no sound in the cave but the shuffle of his own foot, and the stillness and the sight that he saw made him afraid. His hand trembled, and a bridle that he had fell upon the floor. The noise echoed and echoed through the cave, and the warrior who sat nearest to the poor man raised his head. ‘Is it time?’ the warrior said.“‘Not yet, but soon will be,’ the man answered, and the warrior’s head sank again upon the table. The man went out of the cave as quickly as he could, and he never could find the door of it again.“They say that Earl Gerald’s horse has silver shoes. They were half an inch thick when the Earl’s sleep began. When they are worn as thin as a cat’s ear it will be time. Then a miller’s son, who will have six fingers on each hand, will blow a trumpet, and Earl Gerald and all his warriors will come out of the cave. They will fight a great battle and will conquer the enemies of Ireland. Then the country will be peaceful and prosperous and happy, and Gerald will be its King for forty years.”Peter’s mind could not be set at rest by any such stories as this to-night. “What’s the good of all thim old tales to us?” he asked, “Can we pay our rint wid the knowledge that Earl Gerald will be King of Ireland for forty years? They do be all the time fortellin’ and prophesyin’ and predictin’ this thing and that thing and the other thing in thim old tales, and nothin’ ever comes o’ thim. Did you ever know, now, Mrs. O’Brien—I ask you—will you tell me this—did ye ever know of any of the prophecies in any of thim old woman’s tales comin’ thrue?”“It’s surprised I am,” said the old woman, “to hear you, Peter Sullivan, talking that way—you, that had a decent man for your father, and that’s a decent man yourself, all but knowing nothing—you, that have heard the stories of your people. Tell me now, did you ever hear what was foretold of the children of Lir, and did you ever hear if it came true or not?”Perhaps Peter had never heard about the children of Lir, or perhaps he had heard and did not like to say so, because the story would be proof that a prophecy had come true. At any rate, he said nothing. But the old woman seemed resolved that if he had never heard about the children of Lir he should hear about them now.“Lir was a powerful man in the old days of Ireland,” she said, “He had three sons and one daughter, and their mother was dead. The names of the sons were Hugh, Fiachra, and Conn, and the name of the daughter was Fair-shoulder, and beautiful and good children were they all. Lir was visiting once at the castle of Bogha Derg, the King of Conacht, and he saw the daughter of the King, and he fell in love with her and married her.“For a time they were happy, and then the new wife began to be jealous of the love of her husband for his four children. It troubled her so much that she began to lose her beauty and her health, and at last she took to her bed and did not leave it for a year. And after that time there came a great Druid to visit her. You know who and what the Druids were, I think. They were the priests of the old religion of Ireland, before St. Patrick came and made the people Christians. They were powerful in magic; they could bring storms and could drive them away; they could foretell the future; they could work powerful enchantments on people and beasts, and trees and stones, and they could do many other marvellous things.“This Druid talked with the wife of Lir for a long time alone. He made her tell him all that troubled her, and then he told her what she could do to be rid of her husband’s children. He gave her a magic wand and went on his way.“Then she rose from her bed and took the four children with her in her chariot and set out for her father’s castle. On the way she ordered the driver of the chariot to kill the children, but he refused. Then they passed near a lake, and the step-mother told the children to go into the water and bathe. But Fair-shoulder believed that she meant them some harm, and she refused to go, and begged her brothers not to go. So the step-mother called her men, and she and they forced the children out of the chariot and pushed them into the water. Then she touched each of them on the head with the Druid’s wand, and they were changed into four beautiful white swans.“After she had done that, she went on to her father’s castle. When her father had welcomed her, he said, ‘Where are your husband’s children?’“‘They are at home,’ she answered, ‘in their father’s castle.’“‘And are they well?’“‘They are well.’“Now the King himself was a Druid, and more powerful than the one who had given his daughter the wand. More than that, he was a good man, and the other was a wicked one. He did not believe what his daughter told him about the children, and so he put her into a magic sleep. When she was asleep he said to her, ‘Where are your husband’s children?’“And she answered, ‘They are in the lake which we passed by the way as we came here.’“‘And what did you do to them?’“‘I changed them into white swans.’“‘Why did you do that?’“‘Because my husband loved them more than he loved me.’“He woke her out of the magic sleep and called all his people together. Before them all he told her that she should be punished for her wickedness, and then he changed her, by his Druidic power, into a gray vulture. Then he said to the people: ‘This creature that was my daughter has laid a wicked enchantment on her husband’s children. She has changed them into swans. They must keep that shape for many hundreds of years; they must swim in the lakes and the seas and fly over the land, and they must travel far and must suffer much. But there is a hope for them. Many, many hundred years will pass away—so many that even the Druid’s eye can scarcely see what is at the end of them. But at last there shall come strange men across the sea to Erin—men with shaven heads. They shall build houses and shall set up tables in the east ends of their houses, and they shall ring bells. And when the swans that were the children of Lir shall hear the first sound of these bells, they shall have their human shape again, and then they shall be happy forever. But she—the gray vulture—she shall fly in the sky, where it is stormy and cold. Where there are thick clouds and where the rain is made, there shall be her home. She shall not fly where the heaven is blue and where the sun shines warm. The bells of the good men from over the sea shall bring her no peace. Her way shall be with the wind and the hail. If she has any rest it shall be on the peak of some wet crag, where the snow whirls around her, or the fog drives past her, or the sleet cuts against her, or the cold spray of the sea dashes over her. And it shall be so with her till the Day of Doom.’“When the King had finished speaking the gray vulture flew away, and she was never seen again. But the King and all the court rode in chariots to the lake where the white swans were, and Lir and all his people came there, too, when they heard what had been done. And there they all stood and listened to the singing of the four swans. So beautiful was the song that those who listened could think of nothing else while they heard it. They left their horses and their chariots and stood on the shore of the lake and listened to the enchanting music, and never thought of food, or of drink, or of sleep. Even the horses listened to the song as the people did. Day and night they stood there, and many days and nights, and no hunger came upon them, and they felt no cold and no heat, and no wind and no wet.“But the time came when the enchantment that was upon them compelled the four white swans to leave the place. They rose up into the air and flew away and out of sight into the sky. Then the King and his people, and Lir and his people, went back to their castles, and they never saw the four white swans again.“The four white swans flew to Loch Derg, and there for many years they swam on the lake, and fed and slept among the rushes along the shores. In the summer the lake was pleasant and cool, the air was clear and mild, the sky was blue, and the sun was bright and beautiful. Then Fair-shoulder and her brothers forgot that they were unhappy. They sang songs to one another and scarcely remembered that they had ever been anything but swans, swimming on this peaceful water. But when the winter came and the ice was all around, and the wind from the north blew the snow against them, so that it froze among their feathers and they could scarcely move, they were so stiff and so cold—then they remembered how happy they had been in their father’s castle. They could not sing now—not even sad songs. They only longed to have their human shape again and to be back in their old home.“But after many, many years more had passed they ceased to wish for home. They had been swans so long now that it did not seem to them that they had ever been anything else. When the winter came again and again and again, and the days of chilling storm and the nights of freezing darkness were upon them, the poor brothers longed for nothing but the end of it all. The thought of the old castle hall, with its bright fires and its feasts and its music of minstrels and its dances and its games, was only another pain to them, and they wished only to die and to leave their sorrows.“Then they crowded close together, to be as warm as they could, and Fair-shoulder tried to spread her wings over her brothers, to keep the storm from them. She tried to comfort them, and she told them again and again the story that she had heard from the people who stood by the lake to hear them sing, the story that the King had told, that, after many hundreds of years, strange men should come across the sea to Erin—men with shaven heads; that they should build houses and set up tables in the east ends of their houses, and that they should ring bells; and when the swans should hear the first sound of those bells they should have their human shape again, and then they should be happy forever.“For three hundred years they were at Loch Derg, and then, by the power of their enchantment, they were compelled to leave it. They flew to the sea of Moyle, and there they stayed, through the summer’s heat and the winter’s cold, for three hundred years more. Still the sister told her brothers of the strange men who were to come to Erin and of the bells that were to free them. But they could not be comforted. The strange men were too long in coming.“When the three hundred years were past they had to fly away again to another sea. As they flew, they passed over the spot where their father’s castle had stood and where they had been happy children together. Not a stone of the beautiful castle could they see. It had all crumbled down, and the grass had grown over it for many a year. They saw the fox that had its hole where their father’s bright hearth fire had been, and they saw the ditch of dirty water where their father used to welcome kings and bards and wise men at his gate. They kept their way through the air and saw no more; yet they had seen all that there was to see. It gave the poor swans only a little ache at the heart, for they were past hope now. They had suffered too much to believe anything or to think of anything but the suffering that was past and the more suffering that was to come.“The end of their journey came and they swam in a new sea. Again the sister tried to cheer her brothers, but they could not be cheered. The strange men with the shaven heads would never come, they thought. They had waited for them too long.“But the hundreds of years that had passed had done more than to bring sorrow to the poor swans. In lands far away a new faith had grown up, not like the Druids’ faith. And at last across the sea to Erin came the holy St. Patrick. He brought monks with him, and they had shaven heads. They went about the island and preached, and built chapels. In the east end of each chapel they set up an altar, and they said masses and rang bells. And they built a chapel on the island that has since been called the Isle of Glory.“And so, one bright morning, Fair-shoulder and her brothers were swimming near the Isle of Glory, when, of a sudden, there came to them from the shore the sweet sound of a bell. Then Fair-shoulder called to her brothers, and they all swam to the shore. And as soon as they were on shore their form of swans was gone. Fair-shoulder was a beautiful young girl again, and the brothers were strong, beautiful boys. They walked up to the little chapel together, and there a monk baptized them.“And as soon as they were baptized they were young and strong no longer. Fair-shoulder was an old, old woman, and her brothers were old, old men. They were so weak with the age of a thousand years that they fell upon the floor of the chapel. The monks took them up and cared for them for a few days, and then they died. And so the word of the Druid came to pass, that when the strange men should ring their bells the children of Lir should be swans no longer, and should be happy forever.”They all waited for a few minutes, to be sure that there was no more of the story, and then John said: “Mother, it’s easy for you to be tellin’ us them tales, and they may be all thrue enough, and I’m not sayin’ they’re not. But what good are they to us? The word of the Druid came thrue, but how long was it in comin’ thrue? A thousand years?”“A thousand years or more,” said his mother; “but the stories can teach us to be patient, if they can do nothing else.”“They may do that,” said John; “the blessed Lord He knows you’ve been patient, and He knows the rest of us have tried to be. But what does it all come to? We can’t wait a thousand years for the betther times. Pether, here, is right. The States would be a betther place for all of us. If we had the money I’ld say that we ought to go there.”“It’s not the bad times alone that’s in it,” said Peter. “As I told you before, I could stand them. It’s the bother that we’re put to all the time. It’s that would make us go to the States this minute, if we had the chance. But I suppose your mother could never be leavin’ Ireland now, John; she’s gettin’ so old now, maybe she couldn’t stand the journey.”“Have no fear about that,” John answered; “mother’s not so old as you’ld make out, and she’s likely to live longer now than some others that’s here this minute.”As he said this John felt Kitty’s hand suddenly holding his closer, and he knew that he ought not to have said it. “Don’t mind what I’m sayin’,” he said to her in a whisper; “I dunno what I’m talkin’ about, but I didn’t mean you at all, darlin’, nor anybody particular. It’ll all come right somehow, and we’ll soon see the roses back in your cheek, and the smile on your lips, and the light in your eyes. Don’t mind what I said.”“But what’s the use talkin’ of it at all?” said Peter. “You’ve no money and we’ve less. We might as well be talkin’ of goin’ to the moon as to the States.”The old woman did not seem to be paying any attention to what the others were saying, and now nobody at all said anything for a little while. Then Mrs. O’Brien began: “John and Kitty, I think sometimes it’s true I’m getting old and foolish. I don’t know what has made me talk the way I have to-night I’ve seen it coming—oh, I’ve seen it coming all along—yes, longer than any one of you has seen it—and I knew I couldn’t stand in the way. And yet to be leaving the old places—the old fields and hills and paths—the old streams and trees and rocks—the old places where your father and I walked and sat and talked so often together, where you were born and where he lies—I couldn’t bear to think of it. It’s old and weak and foolish I’m getting, and I couldn’t bear to think of it. And so I’ve tried to make you think of other things and to make you think that it would be better somehow, some time. Maybe I’ve said too much, and maybe I’ve kept you from going when you ought to have gone, but you’ll know that it was because I couldn’t bear to think of leaving all the dear places, and you’ll forgive me; John and Kitty, you’ll forgive me. I can say no more. If I couldn’t think of it, yet I must do it. It is right that we should go, and we will go.”“And why should you be talkin’ that way, mother?” said John. “Was it what you said that kept us from goin’ to the States long ago? Sure, if you had said nothing at all, we hadn’t the money to go, and so what difference was it what you said?”“Listen to me, John,” said his mother; “it was all through me that you didn’t leave this land of sorrow long ago. It was because it had been a land of joy as well to me that we all stayed here; and now, since you’re sure that it’s right and best for you to go, it’s not the want of money that shall stand in your way. It’s yourself knows, John, that your father—Heaven be his bed!—was always the careful and the saving man, and I always tried to help him the best I could. The times got a little better with us, as you know, after those worst ones in ’47 and ’48, and we saved a little again—it was not much, but it was something. Your father left it with me before he died, and he said: ‘Keep it always by you till you need it most. Don’t use it till the time comes when you can say, “I shall never need this money more than I need it now.”‘ So I have always kept it, and I have it now. That was why I told you not to fear about the winter. It would have paid our rent if all else had failed, and it would have taken us all through the winter. But it’s better that it should take us to the States. If we stayed here and used the money, we’ld be as bad off in another year. Kitty will be getting strong again there, and it’ll be better for all of us. The time that your father said has come; I’m sure we’ll never be needing the money that he left more than we’re needing it now. There’s no more to be said; we’ll go.”For a little while no more was said. John and Kitty gazed at the old woman in wonder. The thing that they had thought about for so long, and wished for as a happiness that could never be, was come to them. And now it scarcely seemed a happiness; it was half a sorrow. Then Ellen spoke: “Oh, Mrs. O’Brien, it was always you was the good neighbor to us! It was always you was with us in joy and in sorrow! What’ll we ever do at all when you’re gone and we’re left here alone, with none to be so kind to us as you’ve always been?”And Peter said: “I was thinkin’ that same. The Lord go wid you and keep you, wherever you go, but it’ll be the sad day for us when you go away.”“Peter and Ellen,” said the old woman “how could you think that we’ld do a thing like that? You may be a fool sometimes, Peter, but you’re your father’s son. Do you know what your father did for us, Peter? When my John was dying with the fever, he sat and watched with him, and brought him the water and the whey all night, and night after night, when I was so worn out that I could watch no longer. He might have taken the fever himself, and he might have died with it, and he did take it, but the Lord spared his life for a while after that, Heaven rest his soul! And another thing that John said to me before he died was this: ‘As long as you have a bit to eat or a drop to drink or a penny to buy, never let Tom Sullivan or any of his want more than you want yourself.’“And so, Peter and Ellen, when we go to the States, you’ll both go too. There’s enough of the money to take us all there. If you’re ever able to pay it back, you can do it, if you like; but if not, we’ll never ask you for it. If we went away from here without you, my husband would look down from Heaven and see me doing what he told me, with his dying breath, never to do. He would come to me at night and he would say: ‘Mary, you are deserting in their sorrow the children of them that never deserted us in our sorrow.’ Do you think that I could bear that? Do you think that I would do that?”Now I have told you all the talk that went on in the O’Briens’ house that night. Perhaps you think that I have been a good while in doing it. If you will forgive me, I will try to get on with the story a little faster after this. Only one word more about this talk: you must not think that this was the first time that these five people had ever gone over and over this subject of America, or “the States,” as they called it. They had talked of it many times, but Mrs. O’Brien had never given the word that they should go. The rest of them talked on and on of what they wished. But when she spoke, they all knew that she spoke of what was to be. They knew now that they should never talk of going again, but they should go.","['upon', 'time', 'sim′ba', 'lion', 'fee′see', 'hyena', 'keetee′tee', 'rabbit', 'make', 'mind', 'little', 'farm',

1575,irish,Princess Finola and the Dwarf,"A long, long time ago there lived in a little hut in the midst of a bare, brown, lonely moor an old woman and a young girl. The old woman was withered, sour-tempered, and dumb. The young girl was as sweet and as fresh as an opening rosebud, and her voice was as musical as the whisper of a stream in the woods in the hot days of summer. The little hut, made of branches woven closely together, was shaped like a beehive. In the center of the hut, a fire burned night and day from year’s end to year’s end, though it was never touched or tended by human hand. In the cold days and nights of winter it gave out light and heat that made the hut cosy and warm, but in the summer nights and days it gave out light only. With their heads to the wall of the hut and their feet towards the fire were two sleeping-couches––one of plain woodwork, in which slept the old woman; the other was Finola’s. It was of bog-oak, polished as a looking-glass, and on it were carved flowers and birds of all kinds, that gleamed and shone in the light of the fire. This couch was fit for a princess, and a princess Finola was, though she did not know it herself.Outside the hut, the bare, brown, lonely moor stretched for miles on every side, but towards the east it was bounded by a range of mountains that looked to Finola blue in the daytime, but which put on a hundred changing colours as the sun went down. Nowhere was a house to be seen, nor a tree, nor a flower, nor sign of any living thing. From morning till night, nor hum of bee, nor song of bird, nor voice of man, nor any sound fell on Finola’s ear. When the storm was in the air the great waves thundered on the shore beyond the mountains, and the wind shouted in the glens; but when it sped across the moor it lost its voice, and passed as silently as the dead. At first the silence frightened Finola, but she got used to it after a time, and often broke it by talking to herself and singing.The only other person beside the old woman Finola ever saw was a dumb dwarf who, mounted on a broken-down horse, came once a month to the hut, bringing with him a sack of corn for the old woman and Finola. Although he couldn’t speak to her, Finola was always glad to see the dwarf and his old horse, and she used to give them cake made with her own white hands. As for the dwarf he would have died for the little princess, he was so much in love with her, and often and often his heart was heavy and sad as he thought of her pining away in the lonely moor.It chanced that he came one day, and she did not, as usual, come out to greet him. He made signs to the old woman, but she took up a stick and struck him, and beat his horse and drove him away; but as he was leaving he caught a glimpse of Finola at the door of the hut, and saw that she was crying. This sight made him so very miserable that he could think of nothing else but her sad face that he had always seen so bright, and he allowed the old horse to go on without minding where he was going. Suddenly he heard a voice saying: “It is time for you to come.”The dwarf looked, and right before him, at the foot of a green hill, was a little man not half as big as himself, dressed in a green jacket with brass buttons, and a red cap and tassel.“It is time for you to come,” he said the second time; “but you are welcome, anyhow. Get off your horse and come in with me, that I may touch your lips with the wand of speech, that we may have a talk together.”The dwarf got off his horse and followed the little man through a hole in the side of a green hill. The hole was so small that he had to go on his hands and knees to pass through it, and when he was able to stand he was only the same height as the little fairyman. After walking three or four steps they were in a splendid room, as bright as day. Diamonds sparkled in the roof as stars sparkle in the sky when the night is without a cloud. The roof rested on golden pillars, and between the pillars were silver lamps, but their light was dimmed by that of the diamonds. In the middle of the room was a table, on which were two golden plates and two silver knives and forks, and a brass bell as big as a hazelnut, and beside the table were two little chairs covered with blue silk and satin.“Take a chair,” said the fairy, “and I will ring for the wand of speech.”The dwarf sat down, and the fairyman rang the little brass bell, and in came a little weeny dwarf no bigger than your hand.“Bring me the wand of speech,” said the fairy, and the weeny dwarf bowed three times and walked out backwards, and in a minute he returned, carrying a little black wand with a red berry at the top of it, and, giving it to the fairy, he bowed three times and walked out backwards as he had done before.The little man waved the rod three times over the dwarf, and struck him once on the right shoulder and once on the left shoulder, and then touched his lips with the red berry, and said: “Speak!”The dwarf spoke, and he was so rejoiced at hearing the sound of his own voice that he danced about the room.“Who are you at all, at all?” said he to the fairy.“Who is yourself?” said the fairy. “But come, before we have any talk let us have something to eat, for I am sure you are hungry.”Then they sat down to table, and the fairy rang the little brass bell twice, and the weeny dwarf brought in two boiled snails in their shells, and when they had eaten the snails he brought in a dormouse, and when they had eaten the dormouse he brought in two wrens, and when they had eaten the wrens he brought in two nuts full of wine, and they became very merry, and the fairyman sang “Cooleen dhas,” and the dwarf sang “The little blackbird of the glen.”“Did you ever hear the ‘Foggy Dew?’” said the fairy.“No,” said the dwarf.“Well, then, I’ll give it to you; but we must have some more wine.”And the wine was brought, and he sang the “Foggy Dew,” and the dwarf said it was the sweetest song he had ever heard, and that the fairyman’s voice would coax the birds off the bushes.“You asked me who I am?” said the fairy.“I did,” said the dwarf.“And I asked you who is yourself?”“You did,” said the dwarf.“And who are you, then?”“Well, to tell the truth, I don’t know,” said the dwarf, and he blushed like a rose.“Well, tell me what you know about yourself.”“I remember nothing at all,” said the dwarf, “before the day I found myself going along with a crowd of all sorts of people to the great fair of the Liffey. We had to pass by the king’s palace on our way, and as we were passing the king sent for a band of jugglers to come and show their tricks before him. I followed the jugglers to look on, and when the play was over the king called me to him, and asked me who I was and where I came from. I was dumb then, and couldn’t answer; but even if I could speak I could not tell him what he wanted to know, for I remember nothing of myself before that day. Then the king asked the jugglers, but they knew nothing about me, and no one knew anything, and then the king said he would take me into his service; and the only work I have to do is to go once a month with a bag of corn to the hut in the lonely moor.”“And there you fell in love with the little princess,” said the fairy, winking at the dwarf.The poor dwarf blushed twice as much as he had done before.“You need not blush,” said the fairy; “it is a good man’s case. And now tell me, truly, do you love the princess, and what would you give to free her from the spell of enchantment that is over her?”“I would give my life,” said the dwarf.“Well, then, listen to me,” said the fairy. “The Princess Finola was banished to the lonely moor by the king, your master. He killed her father, who was the rightful king, and would have killed Finola, only he was told by an old sorceress that if he killed her he would die himself on the same day, and she advised him to banish her to the lonely moor, and she said she would fling a spell of enchantment over it, and that until the spell was broken Finola could not leave the moor. And the sorceress also promised that she would send an old woman to watch over the princess by night and by day, so that no harm should come to her; but she told the king that he himself should select a messenger to take food to the hut, and that he should look out for some one who had never seen or heard of the princess, and whom he could trust never to tell anyone anything about her; and that is the reason he selected you.”“Since you know so much,” said the dwarf, “can you tell me who I am, and where I came from?”“You will know that time enough,” said the fairy. “I have given you back your speech. It will depend solely on yourself whether you will get back your memory of who and what you were before the day you entered the king’s service. But are you really willing to try and break the spell of enchantment and free the princess?”“I am,” said the dwarf.“Whatever it will cost you?”“Yes, if it cost me my life,” said the dwarf; “but tell me, how can the spell be broken?”“Oh, it is easy enough to break the spell if you have the weapons,” said the fairy.“And what are they, and where are they?” said the dwarf.“The spear of the shining haft and the dark blue blade and the silver shield,” said the fairy. “They are on the farther bank of the Mystic Lake in the Island of the Western Seas. They are there for the man who is bold enough to seek them. If you are the man who will bring them back to the lonely moor you will only have to strike the shield three times with the haft, and three times with the blade of the spear, and the silence of the moor will be broken for ever, the spell of enchantment will be removed, and the princess will be free.”“I will set out at once,” said the dwarf, jumping from his chair.“And whatever it cost you,” said the fairy, “will you pay the price?”“I will,” said the dwarf.“Well, then, mount your horse, give him his head, and he will take you to the shore opposite the Island of the Mystic Lake. You must cross to the island on his back, and make your way through the water-steeds that swim around the island night and day to guard it; but woe betide you if you attempt to cross without paying the price, for if you do the angry water-steeds will rend you and your horse to pieces. And when you come to the Mystic Lake you must wait until the waters are as red as wine, and then swim your horse across it, and on the farther side you will find the spear and shield; but woe betide you if you attempt to cross the lake before you pay the price, for if you do, the black Cormorants of the Western Seas will pick the flesh from your bones.”“What is the price?” said the dwarf.“You will know that time enough,” said the fairy; “but now go, and good luck go with you.”The dwarf thanked the fairy, and said good-bye! He then threw the reins on his horse’s neck, and started up the hill, that seemed to grow bigger and bigger as he ascended, and the dwarf soon found that what he took for a hill was a great mountain. After travelling all the day, toiling up by steep crags and heathery passes, he reached the top as the sun was setting in the ocean, and he saw far below him out in the waters the island of the Mystic Lake.He began his descent to the shore, but long before he reached it the sun had set, and darkness, unpierced by a single star, dropped upon the sea. The old horse, worn out by his long and painful journey, sank beneath him, and the dwarf was so tired that he rolled off his back and fell asleep by his side.He awoke at the breaking of the morning, and saw that he was almost at the water’s edge. He looked out to sea, and saw the island, but nowhere could he see the water-steeds, and he began to fear he must have taken a wrong course in the night, and that the island before him was not the one he was in search of. But even while he was so thinking he heard fierce and angry snortings, and, coming swiftly from the island to the shore, he saw the swimming and prancing steeds. Sometimes their heads and manes only were visible, and sometimes, rearing, they rose half out of the water, and, striking it with their hoofs, churned it into foam, and tossed the white spray to the skies. As they approached nearer and nearer their snortings became more terrible, and their nostrils shot forth clouds of vapour. The dwarf trembled at the sight and sound, and his old horse, quivering in every limb, moaned piteously, as if in pain. On came the steeds, until they almost touched the shore, then rearing, they seemed about to spring on to it. The frightened dwarf turned his head to fly, and as he did so he heard the twang of a golden harp, and right before him who should he see but the little man of the hills, holding a harp in one hand and striking the strings with the other.“Are you ready to pay the price?” said he, nodding gaily to the dwarf.As he asked the question, the listening water-steeds snorted more furiously than ever.“Are you ready to pay the price?” said the little man a second time.A shower of spray, tossed on shore by the angry steeds, drenched the dwarf to the skin, and sent a cold shiver to his bones, and he was so terrified that he could not answer.“For the third and last time, are you ready to pay the price?” asked the fairy, as he flung the harp behind him and turned to depart.When the dwarf saw him going he thought of the little princess in the lonely moor, and his courage came back, and he answered bravely:“Yes, I am ready.”The water-steeds, hearing his answer, and snorting with rage, struck the shore with their pounding hoofs.“Back to your waves!” cried the little harper; and as he ran his fingers across his lyre, the frightened steeds drew back into the waters.“What is the price?” asked the dwarf.“Your right eye,” said the fairy; and before the dwarf could say a word, the fairy scooped out the eye with his finger, and put it into his pocket.The dwarf suffered most terrible agony; but he resolved to bear it for the sake of the little princess. Then the fairy sat down on a rock at the edge of the sea, and, after striking a few notes, he began to play the “Strains of Slumber.”The sound crept along the waters, and the steeds, so ferocious a moment before, became perfectly still. They had no longer any motion of their own, and they floated on the top of the tide like foam before a breeze.“Now,” said the fairy, as he led the dwarf’s horse to the edge of the tide.The dwarf urged the horse into the water, and once out of his depth, the old horse struck out boldly for the island. The sleeping water-steeds drifted helplessly against him, and in a short time he reached the island safely, and he neighed joyously as his hoofs touched solid ground.The dwarf rode on and on, until he came to a bridle-path, and following this, it led him up through winding lanes, bordered with golden furze that filled the air with fragrance, and brought him to the summit of the green hills that girdled and looked down on the Mystic Lake. Here the horse stopped of his own accord, and the dwarf’s heart beat quickly as his eye rested on the lake, that, clipped round by the ring of hills, seemed in the breezeless and sunlit air––“As still as death,And as bright as life can be.”After gazing at it for a long time, he dismounted, and lay at his ease in the pleasant grass. Hour after hour passed, but no change came over the face of the waters, and when the night fell sleep closed the eyelids of the dwarf.The song of the lark awoke him in the early morning, and, starting up, he looked at the lake, but its waters were as bright as they had been the day before.Towards midday he beheld what he thought was a black cloud sailing across the sky from east to west. It seemed to grow larger as it came nearer and nearer, and when it was high above the lake he saw it was a huge bird, the shadow of whose outstretched wings darkened the waters of the lake; and the dwarf knew it was one of the Cormorants of the Western Seas. As it descended slowly, he saw that it held in one of its claws a branch of a tree larger than a full-grown oak, and laden with clusters of ripe red berries. It alighted at some distance from the dwarf, and, after resting for a time, it began to eat the berries and to throw the stones into the lake, and wherever a stone fell a bright red stain appeared in the water. As he looked more closely at the bird the dwarf saw that it had all the signs of old age, and he could not help wondering how it was able to carry such a heavy tree.Later in the day, two other birds, as large as the first, but younger, came up from the west and settled down beside him. They also ate the berries, and throwing the stones into the lake it was soon as red as wine.When they had eaten all the berries, the young birds began to pick the decayed feathers off the old bird and to smooth his plumage. As soon as they had completed their task, he rose slowly from the hill and sailed out over the lake, and dropping down on the waters, dived beneath them. In a moment he came to the surface, and shot up into the air with a joyous cry, and flew off to the west in all the vigour of renewed youth, followed by the other birds.When they had gone so far that they were like specks in the sky, the dwarf mounted his horse and descended towards the lake.He was almost at the margin, and in another minute would have plunged in, when he heard a fierce screaming in the air, and before he had time to look up, the three birds were hovering over the lake.The dwarf drew back frightened.The birds wheeled over his head, and then, swooping down, they flew close to the water, covering it with their wings, and uttering harsh cries.Then, rising to a great height, they folded their wings and dropped headlong, like three rocks, on the lake, crashing its surface, and scattering a wine-red shower upon the hills.Then the dwarf remembered what the fairy told him, that if he attempted to swim the lake, without paying the price, the three Cormorants of the Western Seas would pick the flesh off his bones. He knew not what to do, and was about to turn away, when he heard once more the twang of the golden harp, and the little fairy of the hills stood before him.“Faint heart never won fair lady,” said the little harper. “Are you ready to pay the price? The spear and shield are on the opposite bank, and the Princess Finola is crying this moment in the lonely moor.”At the mention of Finola’s name the dwarf’s heart grew strong.“Yes,” he said; “I am ready––win or die. What is the price?”“Your left eye,” said the fairy. And as soon as said he scooped out the eye, and put it in his pocket.The poor blind dwarf almost fainted with pain.“It’s your last trial,” said the fairy, “and now do what I tell you. Twist your horse’s mane round your right hand, and I will lead him to the water. Plunge in, and fear not. I gave you back your speech. When you reach the opposite bank you will get back your memory, and you will know who and what you are.”Then the fairy led the horse to the margin of the lake.“In with you now, and good luck go with you,” said the fairy.The dwarf urged the horse. He plunged into the lake, and went down and down until his feet struck the bottom. Then he began to ascend, and as he came near the surface of the water the dwarf thought he saw a glimmering light, and when he rose above the water he saw the bright sun shining and the green hills before him, and he shouted with joy at finding his sight restored.But he saw more. Instead of the old horse he had ridden into the lake he was bestride a noble steed, and as the steed swam to the bank the dwarf felt a change coming over himself, and an unknown vigour in his limbs.When the steed touched the shore he galloped up the hillside, and on the top of the hill was a silver shield, bright as the sun, resting against a spear standing upright in the ground.The dwarf jumped off, and, running towards the shield, he saw himself as in a looking-glass.He was no longer a dwarf, but a gallant knight. At that moment his memory came back to him, and he knew he was Conal, one of the Knights of the Red Branch, and he remembered now that the spell of dumbness and deformity had been cast upon him by the Witch of the Palace of the Quicken Trees.Slinging his shield upon his left arm, he plucked the spear from the ground and leaped on to his horse. With a light heart he swam back over the lake, and nowhere could he see the black Cormorants of the Western Seas, but three white swans floating abreast followed him to the bank. When he reached the bank he galloped down to the sea, and crossed to the shore.Then he flung the reins upon his horse’s neck, and swifter than the wind the gallant horse swept on and on, and it was not long until he was bounding over the enchanted moor. Wherever his hoofs struck the ground, grass and flowers sprang up, and great trees with leafy branches rose on every side.At last the knight reached the little hut. Three times he struck the shield with the haft and three times with the blade of his spear. At the last blow the hut disappeared, and standing before him was the little princess.The knight took her in his arms and kissed her; then he lifted her on to the horse, and, leaping up before her, he turned towards the north, to the palace of the Red Branch Knights, and as they rode on beneath the leafy trees from every tree the birds sang out, for the spell of silence over the lonely moor was broken for ever.","['upon', 'time', 'nothing', 'gamble', 'reason', 'people', 'never', 'call', 'anything', 'gamble', 'hansel', 'never', 'cease', 'gamble', 'played', 'away', 'house', 'creditor', 'take',

1586,irish,A Year and a Day,"When Kathleen did not come home at the time she was expected, her father and her grandmother were not much surprised at first. She was in the habit of going where she pleased and of coming back when she pleased. If she chose to be an hour or two late her father or her grandmother might ask her why, or they might not think of it. So, on that May Eve when she danced with the Good People, as it began to get late and still she did not come, they had no doubt that she had decided to make her visit at the Sullivans’ a little longer than she had intended. When it got later and still she did not come, her father said that he would walk over to the Sullivans’ and come back with her. He never thought of not finding her there. Even when he got there and Ellen told him that Kathleen had gone away hours ago and had said that she was going home, he did not think that any harm could have come to her.“She met some of the girls that she knew and went with them, maybe,” he said, “and she’ll be home before me.”But when he got home again and found that she was not there, and when he told his mother that she was not at the Sullivans’, they both began to be a little worried. They told each other over and over that Kathleen knew how to take care of herself and that no harm was likely to come to her, but they both doubted their own words. Late at night John went to the Sullivans’ again, taking the way that he thought Kathleen would be likely to take, and looking everywhere for her, though he knew that to search for her in such a way as that was nonsense.It does not belong to the story to tell how they went on searching. All the next day they searched. They tried every way that they knew, and every way that the police knew, and every way that anybody could think of, to find her, and there was no trace. Late that day one of the girls who had walked through the Park with Kathleen came to see her, not knowing that she was lost. Then she told where she had seen Kathleen last. She told how Kathleen had dropped behind the others, though she had said that she wanted to get home early, how they had called to her, how she had answered, and how they had gone on, thinking that she would soon follow.Then Mrs. O’Brien said to John: “You do not need to search for her any longer. She is with the Good People. I have seen that place often, and it always looked to me like a place where the Good People might be. Last night was May Eve. There is no time in the whole year when the Good People have more power, and especially to carry off young girls. They have taken her with them. Some time she may come back, or some time we may get her back, but it is of no use for you to search for her any more.”But John went on searching still. The next day and for many days he looked for her and tried every means to find her, but she could not be found. Again and again his mother told him that it was of no use, but still he said: “It might be some use, and I wouldn’t be easy if I didn’t try.”By and by there came a time when even John did not think that there was any use in trying longer. He read many papers, from many different cities, hoping always to find something about some unknown girl who had been found, sick or hurt or helpless, somewhere, but he said little about her. He went on with his old work, and he and his mother were alone and lonely in the house. Then John came to believe that Kathleen was dead. He told his mother this and she answered: “Kathleen is not dead.”“And how do you know that, mother?” John said. “You always say that the Good People took her away, but that might be true, and still she might be dead by now. And the Good People might not have taken her at all. How do you know?”“I don’t know that the Good People took her,” she answered, “though I think they did; but I am sure she is not dead.”“And how are you sure, mother?”“Kathleen could never die,” Mrs. O’Brien said, “without I’ld hear the banshee.”“The banshee?” said John. “There’s no banshee here. There’s banshees only in Ireland.”“Our banshee is here,” his mother answered. “I know she is here. You’ve heard me tell of her. She’s the sad, mourning woman of the Good People that weeps and wails about the house when anybody of the family is to die, anywhere in the world. It’s true, as you say, that the banshees mostly stay in Ireland, though they are heard to cry and moan for those of the family who are to die in any part of the world. But sometimes the banshee leaves Ireland with the family that she belongs to, and so did ours. Wouldn’t I know her voice? Didn’t I hear her wail and scream before your father died, so many, many years ago? Oh, I’ld never forget it. I’ld know her voice.”“Then why didn’t you hear her,” John asked “before Kitty died, and why didn’t you know before that she was to die?”“I did hear the banshee that time,” his mother answered, “but I couldn’t tell that it was Kitty that was to die. It was the night before she died. I heard a little moan, that was more like the wind than anything else, and then it grew louder, and it was a sob and a soft wail. It did not grow very loud. Then I could hear that it was like the keen that the women cry over the dead at home. I knew that it was the banshee. No, I could not be wrong about her; I had heard her before. But I never thought of Kitty then. I thought: ‘I’m an old woman—an old woman—though I would never let them say so; and now my time has come. I shall soon be with him again. If I could only see a child of John’s and Kitty’s before I go, I’ld go gladly. If I could only say to him: “Before I came to you I held John’s and Kitty’s child in my arms,” then I’ld go gladly.’ That was what I said to myself that time. But it was Kitty that the banshee meant. And now, though I felt then the first time that I was an old woman, here I am still, and Kitty is gone and the child is grown up to be a woman and she is lost. But she is not dead, John; she is not dead. Kathleen couldn’t die without I’ld hear the banshee.”It was not once only that John and his mother talked together in some such way as this. It was a dozen times at least, perhaps two dozen times, that she told him that, whatever had come to Kathleen, she was not dead—that she could not be dead, because the banshee had not moaned and cried about the house, as she was sure to do before any one of the O’Briens could die. And so John, seeing his mother careworn and anxious, but never so full of sorrow as himself, came to think that he ought to bear it better, and not let her see him always so troubled and so sad. Yet he could not believe all that his mother said quite as she believed it, and she had to tell him all of it again and again, and she told him, too, that when the time came she meant to try to get Kathleen back from the Good People. And after a while John did not think every time that he heard anybody at the door that it was Kathleen at last, and all in the house went on as it had gone before, only that Kathleen was not there. But that “only” was enough, and it was a different house.The dreadful spring was past; the horrible, dull, anxious summer was gone; the cruel, chilly autumn went by; the cold, dead, heartless winter dragged through; another spring came, cheerless, hopeless, helpless, like the last.“Shaun,” said Mrs. O’Brien, “do you know when it was that Kathleen went away?”“Could I ever forget?” said John.“When was it?”“It was May Eve.”“And what is to-day, John?”“It’s the last day of April,” John answered; “it’s a year this night she’s been away. Could I forget it? Don’t I think of it all the time?”“There’s no time in the year,” Mrs. O’Brien said, “when the Good People have more power than on May Eve.”“Oh, mother,” said John, “don’t talk to me of the Good People; I’ve heard too much of them. I don’t care if there are any Good People or not. I only know that Kathleen has been from us a year. When her mother died I could bear it, because I had Kathleen left, but now she’s gone, and how can I bear it?”“Listen to me, John,” his mother went on. “It’s on May Eve, as I told you, that the Good People have great power. It’s then that they dance, and then they make young girls or young men that they want come and dance with them, and then they carry them off. But it’s on May Eve, too, sometimes, that they can be got back by those who know what to do. And so it’s to-night that we must try to get Kathleen back. I wouldn’t tell you till the time came, for fear you might hope too much. We may not find her, and then we may, and you must come with us, for we don’t know how much help we’ll need.”“Who is it that I must come with?” John asked.“With me and with the girls that were with Kathleen that night and saw her last.”“How do we know that they can come?” said John. “It’s late in the day now and they may be away from home.”“I’ve taken care of all that,” Mrs. O’Brien said; “they’ll be here in a little while to go with us.”In a little while the girls came. Then they and Mrs. O’Brien and John went together to the place where Kathleen had met the girls, on her way home from the Sullivans’, a year ago. “Was it about this time of the day,” Mrs. O’Brien asked, “that you met Kathleen here a year ago to-night?”“It was,” one of the girls said, “about this time.”“Then you must take us,” Mrs. O’Brien went on, “just the way that you went, and show us the very place where Kathleen stood, the last instant that you saw her.”They all walked along through the Park, the girls leading the way. “How can they find the very place again?” said John. “It’s been a year since then. It’s likely they have forgot the spot. How could they remember it so long?”“John,” said his mother, “will you never trust me? Do you think that I’ve been waiting for them to forget all this time? The very evening after Kathleen was lost they brought me here and then took me to the very spot where they saw her last. They talked of it between themselves and decided just where it was, and many a time since they’ve been with me here, so that they could not forget it.”In a few minutes the girls stopped. “This is the place where we saw her last,” they said; “just here. She stood here and seemed to be looking at something there on the grass.”Mrs. O’Brien whispered: “Stand still here, all of you, and do not speak or stir unless I call to you; then do whatever I tell you, and do it quickly.”Mrs. O’Brien drew out something which was hung about her neck, by a chain, under her gown. She held it before her in her hand. She stepped upon the grass and looked all around her. She went a few steps forward and looked around again. She went a little to the left, then a little more to the right. And then, to those who were watching, it seemed as if she saw something, though they could see nothing but her. For she made a few hurried steps and then put out her left hand, as if to take hold of something. Then they saw her raise her right hand, as if to touch the something that she had taken hold of, with what she held in it. Still they could see nothing except her, but now she hurried toward them, and suddenly they saw that she was leading Kathleen, with her left arm around her and holding her right hand against her forehead.“Take her and go home with her,” she said to John, “as quickly as you can. The rest of us will follow.”“Oh, father,” said Kathleen, “I am so glad that you came to meet me! Have you and grandmother been worried about me all day? I was afraid you would be, but the baby needed me, and I couldn’t send any word to you. And I promised Terence that I would come back—not Terence Sullivan, but the Terence that lives in there. Please ask some of the Good People to tell him that I will come back to-morrow. Then I will go home with you.”“Take her home! Take her home!” her grandmother cried. And John led her away as fast as he could, while the rest followed.No one said anything more till they were at home, for it was only a little way. Kathleen scarcely looked at her father till they came into the house, where it was light. “Why, father,” she said, “what makes you look so queer? You look so much older than you did yesterday, and you—oh, I am afraid you were dreadfully worried about me. I didn’t think you would be—such a little while. I forgot that you would be worried. There was so much to see there, and then I had to take care of the baby—and so I forgot. It was very wrong for me to forget, and I am so sorry you were anxious about me. But I thought of you and grandmother just as we were coming out to dance to-night, and as soon as we were done dancing I was coming home. And why were you all there where we were dancing? Did you think that I would be there? You ought not to have been afraid, father. It was just such a little while.”John did not seem to think anything about its being wrong for Kathleen to forget. He did not seem to think of anything but that she had come back. “Just a little while, do you call it?” he said. “Do you call a year a little while for you to be away from me, Kathleen? And from your grandmother? Don’t you see how she has worried about you, too, all this long year? And what could I think but that you was dead? Your grandmother never thought so, but I could think nothing else.”“A year!” Kathleen cried. “What do you mean, father? What do you mean? Oh, grandmother, is there anything wrong? Has he been sick? What is it?”“Be quiet, John,” said Mrs. O’Brien, “and let me talk with Kathleen. Come here, Kathleen. No, there is nothing wrong, dear. Now listen, and answer what I ask you. When did you see your father and me last before to-night?”“Why, you know that, grandmother,” Kathleen answered. “I saw father yesterday morning, and I saw you yesterday afternoon, when I left you to go to the Sullivans’.”“And where have you been since then?” Mrs. O’Brien asked.Kathleen closed her eyes and clasped her hands, as she thought of it. “Oh, it was so wonderful!” she said. “I was inside the hill in the Park. I walked right in there on the water with the Good People. And it was so beautiful there—all gold and silver and jewels—and the music—the music that Terence played! And I must go back. I promised him I would.”“And how long were you there?” Mrs. O’Brien asked.“All the time,” Kathleen said; “all night and all day; I didn’t go anywhere else. And when it was time for them all to come out to dance to-night—they were dancing, you know, when I first saw them, and they asked me to dance with them, and then I went into the hill with them. And to-night we came out to dance again, and it was only a little while when you came, and then I saw father, and he brought me home. But I was coming home myself as soon as the dancing was over.”“Kathleen,” said Mrs. O’Brien, “listen to me now. Don’t be frightened, but listen. You’ve been away from us for a whole year. It was a year ago this night that you danced with the Good People that first time. All this year you have been with them there in the hill. If we had not gone after you to-night, and if I had not known how to bring you back, they would have taken you into the hill for another year, and you might have stayed there, perhaps, as long as you lived.”“But, grandmother! A year! Why, you know it was yesterday!”“Yesterday was a year ago,” her grandmother said. “You can’t understand it now. Don’t try. You must eat something now, and then you must go to bed. To-morrow I can tell you about it better, and then perhaps you can understand.”But Kathleen could not eat. Her going away had been so strange, her coming back had been so wonderful, and what her grandmother had told her had been so marvelous, that she could think of nothing else. By and by she went to her room. While she was undressing she felt something hard in her pocket. She took it out, and it was the little box of ointment that the Queen had given her to put on the baby’s eyes. Now that she was at home again she felt as if she had dreamed all that she had seen and heard while she was away. But she had not dreamed it. Here was this little gold box to prove it. Yet she could not believe it. And they told her that she had been away for a year! What they said must be a dream too. But here was the little gold box, just as the Queen had given it to her. It was a green salve that was in it. She would open it and see if there really was a green salve. If there was, then it was not a dream.She opened it. There was the green salve. Yes, it was exactly as she remembered it. And she could remember it all so well. She remembered how the Queen had given it to her, and surely that was last night. She remembered how she had touched the baby’s eyes with the salve, and how much brighter they had looked after she had done it. Surely it was only this morning that she did that. It seemed to her all so plain. And they said that it had been a year. She could not understand it at all. She laid the little gold box on her bureau, under her glass, and went to bed.The next morning Kathleen could think about things a little more clearly. She could not remember what she had seen and heard in the hill quite so distinctly. She had not forgotten anything, but it all seemed dimmer in her mind than it had been, as if it were long ago. And still it seemed as if it had all happened yesterday. Everybody whom she knew had heard that she was at home again, and everybody came to see her. And they all told her that she had been away for a year. She could not doubt it any longer, and yet she could not understand it. What had she been doing all that time? She could remember just enough to fill up one night and one day, and that was all. Could it be that she had slept for three hundred and sixty-four days and been awake for only one? No, she could not believe that. And so, at last, she came to her grandmother to ask if she could explain it to her.“No,” the old woman said, “I can’t do that. It’s too wonderful for any of us to understand. But it’s no more wonderful than many things that are true, and I’ve heard tales of it before. Often one stays in the land of the Good People, and in other places, too, and thinks that the time has been short, when it has been long. Shall I tell you what happened once to a monk—a holy man—much more wonderful than what happened to you?“One day this monk was in the garden of the monastery where he lived, reading in his book. He was reading in the Psalms, where it says, ‘For a thousand years in thy sight are as yesterday, which is past. And as a watch in the night, things that are counted nothing, shall their years be.’“And he found it hard to believe that even to God Himself a thousand years could seem no more than a day. As he was thinking of this, a bird in a tree near him began to sing, and the song was so beautiful that he forgot the psalm that he had been reading and his thoughts about it, and only listened to the bird. It seemed to him that in all his life he had never heard any music so beautiful.“But soon the bird flew to another tree, farther from the monastery, and the monk followed, to listen to its song again. Then the bird flew to a tree farther off, and still the monk followed. Once more the bird flew to another tree, and once more the monk followed it, for it seemed to him that as long as that bird sang he could listen to nothing else and could think of nothing else. But he saw that the sun had gone down and he knew that it was time for him to go back to the monastery. As he went back he looked at the colors that the sun had left behind it in the sky, and he thought that they were as beautiful to see as the voice of the bird was to hear.“They were all faded and the darkness had come on when he reached the monastery and went in. And if he had wondered at the song of the bird and at the colors in the sky, he wondered yet more when he found himself again in the place where he had lived for many years. For many things about the place were changed, and the men in it were all changed. There was not one face among them that he knew. One of the brothers saw him and came toward him, and he said: ‘Brother, why have all these changes been made here since this morning? And who are all these whom I do not know? I scarcely know my own monastery.’“And the other answered: ‘Who are you that ask this, and why do you come here? For you wear the dress of our order, but you are a stranger. You speak as if you knew the place, yet I myself have lived here for fifty years and I have never seen you before.’“Then the monk told his name and told how he had been at mass in the chapel in the morning and had then gone into the garden to read. And he told how he had read in the Psalms, ‘A thousand years in thy sight are as yesterday, which is past,’ and how, while he was thinking of these words, he had heard the bird singing. He told how he had followed the bird, till he saw that night was coming, and then had come back to the monastery.“And the other said: ‘I remember now that when I first came into this place they told me of a legend that a monk of your name had gone out of this monastery a hundred and fifty years before, and had never come back and had never been heard of again. And now, counting my own fifty years here, that must have been two hundred years ago.’“Then the monk said: ‘God has given me such happiness as He gives to few until they are with Him in Heaven, for these two hundred years have seemed to me to be only a part of a day. Now hear my confession, for I know that I soon shall die.’“So the other monk heard his confession, and before midnight he died. And this was the way that God had chosen to show him the meaning of His word.”It was a pretty story, but Kathleen understood no more than before. “No,” said her grandmother, “you cannot understand, and I cannot. We live here such a little while and we are so shut in by time, that we cannot understand how it is with those who live always. But we shall understand when the right time comes, and then we shall wonder how we could ever wonder. And I will tell you another story about it, not to make you understand, but to show you how it is.“Long ago Finn McCool was the great champion of Ireland. He had many warriors, who were called Fenians. He had a son, Oisin, who was a great warrior, too, and besides that a poet and a minstrel. Some of his poems are left to us yet. One day the Fenians were hunting, when they met a beautiful girl riding on a white horse. She called to Oisin, and he went apart from the others to speak with her.“She told him that she was the Princess of Tir-na-n-Oge, and that she had come to take him there, where she was to be married to him. ‘Tir-na-n-Oge’ means ‘Land of the Young,’ and they say that nobody ever grows old there. The Princess was as beautiful as moonlight, and her voice was as sweet as the wind blowing on a harp, and Oisin was in love with her and eager to go before she had done speaking.“He went back to his father and his companions and bade them farewell. It was with tears that Finn said good-by to Oisin, for I think he knew that he should never see him again. But Oisin did not know. Then Oisin mounted the white horse and set the Princess in front of him, and the horse galloped away toward the west. In a little while they came to the sea, and the horse kept straight on, galloping over the water as if it had been a smooth road. Then some say that the water rose around them and covered them and that they were in a beautiful place under the sea. I am not sure of that. Lands there are under the sea, they say, and no doubt there are, but I am not so sure that the real Tir-na-n-Oge is there.“For others say that the tops of blue hills rose before them, and changed to green as they came nearer, and then Oisin saw that soft grass sloped down to the very water here and there, and in other places there were tall cliffs, and trailing vines hung down from the tops of them, covered with bright flowers, and they swung to and fro in the light breeze. Beyond there were more hills, covered with rich woods. Little veils of mist hid them partly and made them more beautiful, and streams poured down from high places and looked like thin, silky tassels hung upon the hills, and they waved in the air, like the waving vines, and some of them seemed never to reach the ground at all, but to blow away into fine silver spray and to mix with the mists of the hills. And golden sunlight poured down over it all, and there was a warm shimmer in the air that made it all look like something seen in a dream. And this was Tir-na-n-Oge.“The horse came to the shore and galloped over soft turf till it seemed to Oisin that they were in the very middle of the island, and there they came to a palace, and Oisin thought that it was more beautiful than anything else that he had seen. It may be that the palace was built of marble, but to Oisin it seemed like blocks of pure snow. It was so long that one might well mount his horse to go the length of it, instead of walking. It had gilded domes that looked like suns, with the light shining on them, and the whole palace was dazzling to look at. All around it were gardens, with trees and plants in full bloom, of all the colors of the rainbow, and colors that are not in the rainbow, and other trees with only deep green leaves, and pathways among them which led down into cool, shady hollows, with clear brooks running through them between banks of soft, dark-green moss, sinking their quiet little song.“Oisin got down off his horse and then lifted the Princess down, and they went into the palace. There the Princess’s father, the King of Tir-na-n-Oge, made Oisin welcome and led both of them to the banquet hall, where a great feast was spread in honor of the Princess and the new Prince. And Oisin thought that if the palace was beautiful outside, it was much more beautiful inside, and as for the table that was before him, he could not think of any of the best things in the world to eat and to drink that were not on it.“The next day the Princess was married to Oisin. For a long time Oisin and the Princess lived in the palace and Oisin thought that he never could be more happy than he was now. The old warriors cared much for what they ate and drank, and Oisin ate and drank better things than he had ever tasted before. He walked with the Princess down through the shady ways among the trees and across the brooks and up the hill-sides among the flowers. They sat together in the garden or in the palace and she sang to him and told him wonderful tales of heroes and of princesses of olden times. Sometimes they rode hunting together, and everywhere they found game, the finest that Oisin had ever seen.“But at last Oisin began to feel that he cared less for all these things than he had done at first. The grass and the flowers and the woods did not seem so fair to him as they had seemed; the sunshine was not such pure gold; he wished that the silver streams would not blow away in spray and mix with the mists; he wanted to see them come down yellow with the earth of the mountains and plunge into caverns with great rushing and roaring; he felt that the warm air was taking his strength from him; he no longer liked the rich feasts that were spread before him every day; he longed to follow the deer through the woods, with his old friends, to kill it and to cook it and eat it in the woods, and then to sleep there, under the trees and the stars; these trees and these gardens were beautiful, it was true, but they were too beautiful; a hard way through a rough forest would have pleased him better now; he did not love the Princess less, but he longed to see his father and his men again; her singing was no less sweet to him than it had ever been before, but he wished that he could be again where the Fenians, after a hard day’s hunt or a hard day’s fight, sat about the fire in their stronghold, and listened to one of them—perhaps himself, for he was the best singer of them all—while he sang songs of great heroes and of great fights.“And one day, when the Princess had been singing to him, he took her harp from her and sang a song of one of his father’s battles, a battle which he had seen himself, where Diarmuid had slain hundreds, and Orcur had slain hundreds, and Erin had been kept from her enemies. Then he said to the Princess: ‘Do not think that I am ungrateful for all the happiness that I have had here, but I am longing to see Erin again and to see my father and his men. It is not so beautiful a land as this, but it is my own land, and I am longing to see it. The air here is sweet and the sunshine is warm, but I should like to breathe the mists and to feel the chill again, if I could only see Erin once more!”Mrs. O’Brien stopped a moment, with the way that she had of seeming to look at things far off. Kathleen said nothing when she paused in this way, and in a minute the old woman went on:“‘You would not be so happy in Erin as you think,’ the Princess answered him. ‘This is the best place for you to stay, and it would break my heart for you to go.’“So Oisin said no more then, but the great longing grew upon him, and every day the delights of Tir-na-n-Oge pleased him less. And at last he spoke of it again, and asked the Princess to let him go for a little while. ‘You would find Erin changed,’ she said, ‘and the Fenians are all gone. How long have you been here with me?’“‘I cannot tell you to a day,’ Oisin answered, ‘but I know that it is weeks since I saw my country and my people.’“‘You have been here,’ said the Princess, ‘for three hundred years.’“Oisin could not understand it, but he thought that if he could live so long and not know that the time had passed, the Fenians, too, might be living still, and he begged again to be allowed to go. At last the Princess saw that he would never be happy unless he went, so she brought him the same white horse that had brought them both to Tir-na-n-Oge. ‘The horse,’ she said, ‘will take you to Erin. But you must sit upon his back and never loose his bridle or get down upon the ground. If you touch the ground of Erin you will be at once a weak, old man, you can never come back to Tir-na-n-Oge, you will never see me, and I shall never see you again. Will you promise me, if I will let you go, that you will not get off the horse’s back or let go his bridle?’“Oisin promised and she let him go. Away over the water the horse galloped again. Tir-na-n-Oge, with its warm sun and its sweet air, was left behind. A damp sea-wind came up, and it blew the salt spray harshly into Oisin’s face as the horse dashed along. It was a joy to him. No more of the soft comforts of that weary island. This was something for a man to face. Yet he did not forget the Princess, and he meant to go back to her when he had seen his land and his people once more. Then the clouds and the fog drifted away and the sun shone out, but still the salt spray covered him, and he felt stronger as he made his way against it and felt the great, free breeze from the east. And now he saw something like a little cloud on the horizon, and it rose higher and grew wider, and then its misty brown faded away and he saw the beautiful green shores of Erin.”The old woman paused again and said over softly to herself: “The beautiful—beautiful green shores of Erin.”“The horse and the rider soon reached the land now. Oisin rode first to the spot where he had first met the Princess of Tir-na-n-Oge and where he had last seen his father and his companions. He did not think to find them there, but he felt that it was the first place to which he should go. The forest had been cleared away a little, and a strange building stood there. It was a small house, built of stone, and there was a cross on the top of it. Inside he heard a sound of singing. He rode to the door and looked in. There were people kneeling before a man who stood in a higher place than the rest and held up a golden cup.“This was something that Oisin did not understand, and he rode away, remembering what the Princess had told him, that he would find Ireland changed. He wondered if he had been wise to come at all. But he went on, and now he rode fast, in this direction and in that, to try to find the Fenians. Sometimes he asked people whom he met if they could tell him of his father. Some of them shook their heads and said that they knew no such person as Finn McCool. Others laughed at him. One or two old men told him that the Fenians had all died long ago and that the man of greatest power in Ireland now was Patrick. It was hard for him to believe. He would have thought himself in a dream, but a dream seems right and true while it lasts, and this seemed all wrong and false. Yet, when he found a place that he knew and looked for some familiar stronghold of the Fenians, he found only a low mound of earth, grown all over with grass, or perhaps with weeds and bushes. And everywhere he saw these houses of stone, with crosses on their tops.“Then it came into his mind to find this Patrick of whom he heard so much, and to see what sort of man was now the greatest in Ireland. This was an easier matter than searching for the Fenians. Everyone knew where the holy Patrick was, and soon Oisin came near the place and found that the saint was building another of the stone houses. As Oisin came near he saw some men trying to lift a heavy stone upon a car, to take it to the new building. It almost made him laugh to see how small and weak the men were. He knew well that he could put the stone on the car alone. It was no larger than the stones that the Fenians used to throw for sport.“He came near and leaned down from his saddle to lift the stone for the men. He took hold of it and began to raise it, but with the weight the girth of his saddle broke, the saddle slipped around on the horse, Oisin fell, and the horse ran away. Oisin lay there on the ground of Erin, which the Princess had forbidden him to touch, an old man, weak, helpless, blind, hollow-cheeked, wrinkled, white-haired.“The men took him up and carried him to St. Patrick, who welcomed him kindly and kept him for a while in his own house. Many times the saint talked with him and tried to make him a Christian, but Oisin could think of nothing but the grand days of the Fenians. When St. Patrick talked with him he would begin to tell of these, and he would make the poems about them that have been kept till now and give us what we know of Finn McCool and his heroes. And these poems Patrick would have written down. And always Oisin was mourning for the brave old days of Finn McCool or for the days of Tir-na-n-Oge, which seemed to him now still farther off.“Old as he was now, with the heavy weight of more than three hundred years upon him, blind and weak, there was one thing in which Oisin felt himself a better man that St. Patrick or any of his band. St. Patrick and all those who were with him fasted much, and when they ate it was frugally, of bread and the herbs of the field, and but little meat. But this was not enough for Oisin. He remembered how he and his fellow-huntsmen used to follow the deer and kill it, and dress it, and cook it on the moor in the fresh, cool evening, and feast till it was time to sleep, and then wake and follow the deer again. And so the food which was given to him in St. Patrick’s house seemed poor and scanty to him.“He said this to the cook and others in the house, and they made sport of him, because so old a man as he should wish to eat so much. Then he told them tales of the days of his father, how great and strong the men of Erin were then, how much more fertile the land was, and of the great beasts and the great trees and plants and vines that it brought forth. In those days, he said, the leg of a lark was as large as a leg of mutton now, a berry of the wild ash was as large as a sheep, and an ivy leaf as broad as a shield.“They all laughed at him the more when he said these things, and they did not believe a word of it all. ‘Alas!’ he said, ‘how can I show you that what I say is true? The dear heroes whom I knew are all gone. I am left alone to mourn for them, among men who do not even believe how great they were. Everything that I have found is changed, but there may be something that is not changed. Will one of you go with me in a war chariot and drive where I shall tell him, and let me see if I can find anything as I knew it once?’“Then one of them said that he would go with him. The next morning they set out. Oisin told the man where to drive, till they came to a place where Oisin said: ‘Look around you and tell me what you can see on the plain.’“‘I see a stone pillar,’ the man answered.“‘Drive the chariot to it,’ said Oisin, ‘and dig at the foot of the pillar, on the south side of it.’“The man did as Oisin told him, and when he had dug for a while Oisin asked him if he had found anything. ‘There is something long and hard here,’ said the man, ‘like a wooden pole.’“‘Dig it out,’ said Oisin.“The man dug more. ‘I have it out now,’ he said; ‘it is like a great spear, for it has a huge head of rusty iron. I can scarcely lift it.’“‘It is a spear such as the Fenians used,’ said Oisin. ‘Dig still deeper.’“The man dug again. ‘Do you find anything more?’ said Oisin.“‘I have found a great horn,’ the man answered, ‘many times as large as any horn that I ever saw.’“‘It is the great war-horn of my father, Finn McCool,’ said Oisin. ‘Dig deeper.’“The man dug again and said, ‘I have found a lump of bog butter.’“‘Now blow the horn,’ said Oisin.“The man was scarcely able to blow the horn, but he did blow it, and it gave forth a harsh, terrible note, which sounded over the plain and was echoed back from the woods and the rocks with a hoarse, dreadful sound.“‘Look about you,’ said Oisin, ‘and tell me what you see.’“‘Oh, I see,’ said the man, ‘a great flock of birds coming toward us, and every one of them is many times as large as the largest eagle that I have ever seen. I fear that we cannot escape them and that they will kill us. The dog is nearly dead with terror and he is trying to break his chain.’“‘Give him a piece of the bog butter,’ said Oisin, ‘and let him go. Then tell me what he does.’“‘He is running straight toward the birds,’ the man answered, ‘and they are coming straight toward him and toward us, along the ground. Ah! he has caught one of them, and all the rest have flown away! He has killed the bird! He is rushing back to us, with madness in his eyes and his mouth covered with blood and foam! I fear that he will be worse for us than the birds would have been.’“‘Hold the spear straight in front of you as he comes,’ said Oisin, ‘and let him run upon the point of it and kill him.’“The man held the spear as Oisin told him, and when the dog came on he was caught upon the point of it, and it went through his heart and he fell dead.“Then the man went and cut off one of the legs of the bird which had been killed, and they took it with them and started back. As they went they passed a mountain ash which had berries of enormous size, and the man put one of them into the chariot. Then the man saw huge ivy leaves, and he took one of them too. So they went back to St. Patrick’s house and showed all the men there what they had brought. The leg of the bird and the berry and the ivy leaf were even larger than Oisin had said. And after that they all believed the stories that Oisin told them, and all of them agreed that a man who had lived in the days when there were such trees and such beasts and such men in Erin should be his own judge as to how much he needed to eat. And so after that all of St. Patrick’s men treated him as well as did St. Patrick himself.“But Oisin died only a little while after that, the last of the great heroes of Erin. He had lived for more than three hundred years, and it seemed to him no more than the life of a young man.”","['next', 'afternoon', 'muskrat', 'fine', 'hunt', 'brush', 'grow', 'beside', 'game',

1663,irish,The Shee an Gannon and the Gruagach Gaire,"The Shee an Gannon was born in the morning, named at noon, and went in the evening to ask his daughter of the king of Erin.“I will give you my daughter in marriage,” said the king of Erin; “you won’t get her, though, unless you go and bring me back the tidings that I want, and tell me what it is that put a stop to the laughing of the Gruagach Gaire, who before this laughed always, and laughed so loud that the whole world heard him. There are twelve iron spikes out here in the garden behind my castle. On eleven of the spikes are the heads of kings’ sons who came seeking my daughter in marriage, and all of them went away to get the knowledge I wanted. Not one was able to get it and tell me what stopped the Gruagach Gaire from laughing. I took the heads off them all when they came back without the tidings for which they went, and I’m greatly in dread that your head’ll be on the twelfth spike, for I’ll do the same to you that I did to the eleven kings’ sons unless you tell what put a stop to the laughing of the Gruagach.”The Shee an Gannon made no answer, but left the king and pushed away to know could he find why the Gruagach was silent.He took a glen at a step, a hill at a leap, and travelled all day till evening. Then he came to a house. The master of the house asked him what sort was he, and he said: “A young man looking for hire.”“Well,” said the master of the house, “I was going to-morrow to look for a man to mind my cows. If you’ll work for me, you’ll have a good place, the best food a man could have to eat in this world, and a soft bed to lie on.”The Shee an Gannon took service, and ate his supper. Then the master of the house said: “I am the Gruagach Gaire; now that you are my man and have eaten your supper, you’ll have a bed of silk to sleep on.”Next morning after breakfast the Gruagach said to the Shee an Gannon: “Go out now and loosen my five golden cows and my bull without horns, and drive them to pasture; but when you have them out on the grass, be careful you don’t let them go near the land of the giant.”The new cowboy drove the cattle to pasture, and when near the land of the giant, he saw it was covered with woods and surrounded by a high wall. He went up, put his back against the wall, and threw in a great stretch of it; then he went inside and threw out another great stretch of the wall, and put the five golden cows and the bull without horns on the land of the giant.Then he climbed a tree, ate the sweet apples himself, and threw the sour ones down to the cattle of the Gruagach Gaire.Soon a great crashing was heard in the woods,—the noise of young trees bending, and old trees breaking. The cowboy looked around, and saw a five-headed giant pushing through the trees; and soon he was before him. “Poor miserable creature!” said the giant; “but weren’t you impudent to come to my land and trouble me in this way? You’re too big for one bite, and too small for two. I don’t know what to do but tear you to pieces.”“You nasty brute,” said the cowboy, coming down to him from the tree, “’tis little I care for you;” and then they went at each other. So great was the noise between them that there was nothing in the world but what was looking on and listening to the combat.They fought till late in the afternoon, when the giant was getting the upper hand; and then the cowboy thought that if the giant should kill him, his father and mother would never find him or set eyes on him again, and he would never get the daughter of the king of Erin. The heart in his body grew strong at this thought. He sprang on the giant, and with the first squeeze and thrust he put him to his knees in the hard ground, with the second thrust to his waist, and with the third to his shoulders.“I have you at last; you’re done for now!” said the cowboy. Then he took out his knife, cut the five heads off the giant, and when he had them off he cut out the tongues and threw the heads over the wall.Then he put the tongues in his pocket and drove home the cattle. That evening the Gruagach couldn’t find vessels enough in all his place to hold the milk of the five golden cows.After supper the cowboy would give no talk to his master, but kept his mind to himself, and went to the bed of silk to sleep.Next morning after breakfast the cowboy drove out his cattle, and going on farther than the day before, stopped at a high wall. He put his back to the wall, threw in a long stretch of it, then went in and threw out another long stretch of it.After that he put the five golden cows and the bull without horns on the land, and going up on a tree, ate sweet apples himself, and threw down the sour ones to the cattle.Now the son of the king of Tisean set out from the king of Erin on the same errand, after asking for his daughter; and as soon as the cowboy drove in his cattle on the second day, he came along by the giant’s land, found the five heads of the giant thrown out by the cowboy the day before, and picking them up, ran off to the king of Erin and put them down before him.“Oh, you have done good work!” said the king. “You have won one third of my daughter.”Soon after the cowboy had begun to eat sweet apples, and the son of the king of Tisean had run off with the five heads, there came a great noise of young trees bending, and old trees breaking, and presently the cowboy saw a giant larger than the one he had killed the day before.“You miserable little wretch!” cried the giant; “what brings you here on my land?”“You wicked brute!” said the cowboy, “I don’t care for you;” and slipping down from the tree, he fell upon the giant.The fight was fiercer than his first one; but towards evening, when he was growing faint, the cowboy remembered that if he should fall, neither his father nor mother would see him again, and he would never get the daughter of the king of Erin.This thought gave him strength; and jumping up, he caught the giant, put him with one thrust to his knees in the hard earth, with a second to his waist, with a third to his shoulders, and then swept the five heads off him and threw them over the wall, after he had cut out the tongues and put them in his pocket.Leaving the body of the giant, the cowboy drove home the cattle, and the Gruagach had still greater trouble in finding vessels for the milk of the five golden cows.After supper the cowboy said not a word, but went to sleep.Next morning he drove the cattle still farther, and came to green woods and a strong wall. Putting his back to the wall, he threw in a great piece of it, and going in, threw out another piece. Then he drove the five golden cows and the bull without horns to the land inside, ate sweet apples himself, and threw down sour ones to the cattle.The son of the king of Tisean came and carried off the heads as on the day before.Presently a third giant came crashing through the woods, and a battle followed more terrible than the other two.Towards evening the giant was gaining the upper hand, and the cowboy, growing weak, would have been killed; but the thought of his parents and the daughter of the king of Erin gave him strength, and he swept the five heads off the giant, and threw them over the wall after he had put the tongues in his pocket.Then the cowboy drove home his cattle; and the Gruagach didn’t know what to do with the milk of the five golden cows, there was so much of it.But when the cowboy was on the way home with the cattle, the son of the king of Tisean came, took the five heads of the giant, and hurried to the king of Erin.“You have won my daughter now,” said the king of Erin when he saw the heads; “but you’ll not get her unless you tell me what stops the Gruagach Gaire from laughing.”On the fourth morning the cowboy rose before his master, and the first words he said to the Gruagach were:“What keeps you from laughing, you who used to laugh so loud that the whole world heard you?”“I’m sorry,” said the Gruagach, “that the daughter of the king of Erin sent you here.”“If you don’t tell me of your own will, I’ll make you tell me,” said the cowboy; and he put a face on himself that was terrible to look at, and running through the house like a madman, could find nothing that would give pain enough to the Gruagach but some ropes made of untanned sheepskin hanging on the wall.He took these down, caught the Gruagach, fastened his two hands behind him, and tied his feet so that his little toes were whispering to his ears. When he was in this state the Gruagach said: “I’ll tell you what stopped my laughing if you set me free.”So the cowboy unbound him, the two sat down together, and the Gruagach said:—“I lived in this castle here with my twelve sons. We ate, drank, played cards, and enjoyed ourselves, till one day when my sons and I were playing, a wizard hare came rushing in, jumped on our table, defiled it, and ran away.“On another day he came again; but if he did, we were ready for him, my twelve sons and myself. As soon as he defiled our table and ran off, we made after him, and followed him till nightfall, when he went into a glen. We saw a light before us. I ran on, and came to a house with a great apartment, where there was a man with twelve daughters, and the hare was tied to the side of the room near the women.“There was a large pot over the fire in the room, and a great stork boiling in the pot. The man of the house said to me: ‘There are bundles of rushes at the end of the room, go there and sit down with your men!’“He went into the next room and brought out two pikes, one of wood, the other of iron, and asked me which of the pikes would I take. I said, ‘I’ll take the iron one;’ for I thought in my heart that if an attack should come on me, I could defend myself better with the iron than the wooden pike.“The man of the house gave me the iron pike, and the first chance of taking what I could out of the pot on the point of the pike. I got but a small piece of the stork, and the man of the house took all the rest on his wooden pike. We had to fast that night; and when the man and his twelve daughters ate the flesh of the stork, they hurled the bare bones in the faces of my sons and myself.“We had to stop all night that way, beaten on the faces by the bones of the stork.“Next morning, when we were going away, the man of the house asked me to stay a while; and going into the next room, he brought out twelve loops of iron and one of wood, and said to me: ‘Put the heads of your twelve sons into the iron loops, or your own head into the wooden one;’ and I said: ‘I’ll put the twelve heads of my sons in the iron loops, and keep my own out of the wooden one.’“He put the iron loops on the necks of my twelve sons, and put the wooden one on his own neck. Then he snapped the loops one after another, till he took the heads off my twelve sons and threw the heads and bodies out of the house; but he did nothing to hurt his own neck.“When he had killed my sons he took hold of me and stripped the skin and flesh from the small of my back down, and when he had done that he took the skin of a black sheep that had been hanging on the wall for seven years and clapped it on my body in place of my own flesh and skin; and the sheepskin grew on me, and every year since then I shear myself, and every bit of wool I use for the stockings that I wear I clip off my own back.”When he had said this, the Gruagach showed the cowboy his back covered with thick black wool.After what he had seen and heard, the cowboy said: “I know now why you don’t laugh, and small blame to you. But does that hare come here still to spoil your table?”“He does indeed,” said the Gruagach.Both went to the table to play, and they were not long playing cards when the hare ran in; and before they could stop him he was on the table, and had put it in such a state that they could not play on it longer if they had wanted to.But the cowboy made after the hare, and the Gruagach after the cowboy, and they ran as fast as ever their legs could carry them till nightfall; and when the hare was entering the castle where the twelve sons of the Gruagach were killed, the cowboy caught him by the two hind legs and dashed out his brains against the wall; and the skull of the hare was knocked into the chief room of the castle, and fell at the feet of the master of the place.“Who has dared to interfere with my fighting pet?” screamed he.“I,” said the cowboy; “and if your pet had had manners, he might be alive now.”The cowboy and the Gruagach stood by the fire. A stork was boiling in the pot, as when the Gruagach came the first time. The master of the house went into the next room and brought out an iron and a wooden pike, and asked the cowboy which would he choose.“I’ll take the wooden one,” said the cowboy; “and you may keep the iron one for yourself.”So he took the wooden one; and going to the pot, brought out on the pike all the stork except a small bite, and he and the Gruagach fell to eating, and they were eating the flesh of the stork all night. The cowboy and the Gruagach were at home in the place that time.In the morning the master of the house went into the next room, took down the twelve iron loops with a wooden one, brought them out, and asked the cowboy which would he take, the twelve iron or the one wooden loop.“What could I do with the twelve iron ones for myself or my master? I’ll take the wooden one.”He put it on, and taking the twelve iron loops, put them on the necks of the twelve daughters of the house, then snapped the twelve heads off them, and turning to their father, said: “I’ll do the same thing to you unless you bring the twelve sons of my master to life, and make them as well and strong as when you took their heads.”The master of the house went out and brought the twelve to life again; and when the Gruagach saw all his sons alive and as well as ever, he let a laugh out of himself, and all the Eastern world heard the laugh.Then the cowboy said to the Gruagach: “It’s a bad thing you have done to me, for the daughter of the king of Erin will be married the day after your laugh is heard.”“Oh! then we must be there in time,” said the Gruagach; and they all made away from the place as fast as ever they could, the cowboy, the Gruagach, and his twelve sons.On the road they came to a woman who was crying very hard.“What is your trouble?” asked the cowboy.“You need have no care,” said she, “for I will not tell you.”“You must tell me,” said he, “for I’ll help you out of it.”“Well,” said the woman, “I have three sons, and they used to play hurley with the three sons of the king of the Sasenach, and they were more than a match for the king’s sons. And it was the rule that the winning side should give three wallops of their hurleys to the other side; and my sons were winning every game, and gave such a beating to the king’s sons that they complained to their father, and the king carried away my sons to London, and he is going to hang them there to-day.”“I’ll bring them here this minute,” said the cowboy. “You have no time,” said the Gruagach.“Have you tobacco and a pipe?” asked the cowboy of the Gruagach.“I have not,” said he.“Well, I have,” said the cowboy; and putting his hand in his pocket, he took out tobacco and a pipe, gave them to the Gruagach, and said: “I’ll be in London and back before you can put tobacco in this pipe and light it.”He disappeared, was back from London with the three boys all safe and well, and gave them to their mother before the Gruagach could get a taste of smoke out of the pipe.“Now come with us,” said the cowboy to the woman and her sons, “to the wedding of the daughter of the king of Erin.”They hurried on; and when within three miles of the king’s castle there was such a throng of people that no one could go a step ahead. “We must clear a road through this,” said the cowboy.“We must indeed,” said the Gruagach; and at it they went, threw the people some on one side and some on the other, and soon they had an opening for themselves to the king’s castle.As they went in, the daughter of the king of Erin and the son of the king of Tisean were on their knees just going to be married. The cowboy drew his hand on the bridegroom, and gave a blow that sent him spinning till he stopped under a table at the other side of the room.“What scoundrel struck that blow?” asked the king of Erin.“It was I,” said the cowboy.“What reason had you to strike the man who won my daughter?”“It was I who won your daughter, not he; and if you don’t believe me, the Gruagach Gaire is here himself. He’ll tell you the whole story from beginning to end, and show you the tongues of the giants.”So the Gruagach came up and told the king the whole story, how the Shee an Gannon had become his cowboy, had guarded the five golden cows and the bull without horns, cut off the heads of the five-headed giants, killed the wizard hare, and brought his own twelve sons to life. “And then,” said the Gruagach, “he is the only man in the whole world I have ever told why I stopped laughing, and the only one who has ever seen my fleece of wool.”When the king of Erin heard what the Gruagach said, and saw the tongues of the giants fitted into the heads, he made the Shee an Gannon kneel down by his daughter, and they were married on the spot.Then the son of the king of Tisean was thrown into prison, and the next day they put down a great fire, and the deceiver was burned to ashes.The wedding lasted nine days, and the last day was better than the first.","['upon', 'time', 'live', 'grow', 'elder',

1709,irish,The Star-Child,"Once upon a time two poor Woodcutters were making their way home through a great pine-forest.  It was winter, and a night of bitter cold.  The snow lay thick upon the ground, and upon the branches of the trees: the frost kept snapping the little twigs on either side of them, as they passed: and when they came to the Mountain-Torrent she was hanging motionless in air, for the Ice-King had kissed her.So cold was it that even the animals and the birds did not know what to make of it.‘Ugh!’ snarled the Wolf, as he limped through the brushwood with his tail between his legs, ‘this is perfectly monstrous weather.  Why doesn’t the Government look to it?’‘Weet! weet! weet!’ twittered the green Linnets, ‘the old Earth is dead and they have laid her out in her white shroud.’‘The Earth is going to be married, and this is her bridal dress,’ whispered the Turtle-doves to each other.  Their little pink feet were quite frost-bitten, but they felt that it was their duty to take a romantic view of the situation.‘Nonsense!’ growled the Wolf.  ‘I tell you that it is all the fault of the Government, and if you don’t believe me I shall eat you.’  The Wolf had a thoroughly practical mind, and was never at a loss for a good argument.‘Well, for my own part,’ said the Woodpecker, who was a born philosopher, ‘I don’t care an atomic theory for explanations.  If a thing is so, it is so, and at present it is terribly cold.’Terribly cold it certainly was.  The little Squirrels, who lived inside the tall fir-tree, kept rubbing each other’s noses to keep themselves warm, and the Rabbits curled themselves up in their holes, and did not venture even to look out of doors.  The only people who seemed to enjoy it were the great horned Owls.  Their feathers were quite stiff with rime, but they did not mind, and they rolled their large yellow eyes, and called out to each other across the forest, ‘Tu-whit!  Tu-whoo!  Tu-whit!  Tu-whoo! what delightful weather we are having!’On and on went the two Woodcutters, blowing lustily upon their fingers, and stamping with their huge iron-shod boots upon the caked snow.  Once they sank into a deep drift, and came out as white as millers are, when the stones are grinding; and once they slipped on the hard smooth ice where the marsh-water was frozen, and their faggots fell out of their bundles, and they had to pick them up and bind them together again; and once they thought that they had lost their way, and a great terror seized on them, for they knew that the Snow is cruel to those who sleep in her arms.  But they put their trust in the good Saint Martin, who watches over all travellers, and retraced their steps, and went warily, and at last they reached the outskirts of the forest, and saw, far down in the valley beneath them, the lights of the village in which they dwelt.So overjoyed were they at their deliverance that they laughed aloud, and the Earth seemed to them like a flower of silver, and the Moon like a flower of gold.Yet, after that they had laughed they became sad, for they remembered their poverty, and one of them said to the other, ‘Why did we make merry, seeing that life is for the rich, and not for such as we are?  Better that we had died of cold in the forest, or that some wild beast had fallen upon us and slain us.’‘Truly,’ answered his companion, ‘much is given to some, and little is given to others.  Injustice has parcelled out the world, nor is there equal division of aught save of sorrow.’But as they were bewailing their misery to each other this strange thing happened.  There fell from heaven a very bright and beautiful star.  It slipped down the side of the sky, passing by the other stars in its course, and, as they watched it wondering, it seemed to them to sink behind a clump of willow-trees that stood hard by a little sheepfold no more than a stone’s-throw away.‘Why! there is a crook of gold for whoever finds it,’ they cried, and they set to and ran, so eager were they for the gold.And one of them ran faster than his mate, and outstripped him, and forced his way through the willows, and came out on the other side, and lo! there was indeed a thing of gold lying on the white snow.  So he hastened towards it, and stooping down placed his hands upon it, and it was a cloak of golden tissue, curiously wrought with stars, and wrapped in many folds.  And he cried out to his comrade that he had found the treasure that had fallen from the sky, and when his comrade had come up, they sat them down in the snow, and loosened the folds of the cloak that they might divide the pieces of gold.  But, alas! no gold was in it, nor silver, nor, indeed, treasure of any kind, but only a little child who was asleep.And one of them said to the other: ‘This is a bitter ending to our hope, nor have we any good fortune, for what doth a child profit to a man?  Let us leave it here, and go our way, seeing that we are poor men, and have children of our own whose bread we may not give to another.’But his companion answered him: ‘Nay, but it were an evil thing to leave the child to perish here in the snow, and though I am as poor as thou art, and have many mouths to feed, and but little in the pot, yet will I bring it home with me, and my wife shall have care of it.’So very tenderly he took up the child, and wrapped the cloak around it to shield it from the harsh cold, and made his way down the hill to the village, his comrade marvelling much at his foolishness and softness of heart.And when they came to the village, his comrade said to him, ‘Thou hast the child, therefore give me the cloak, for it is meet that we should share.’But he answered him: ‘Nay, for the cloak is neither mine nor thine, but the child’s only,’ and he bade him Godspeed, and went to his own house and knocked.And when his wife opened the door and saw that her husband had returned safe to her, she put her arms round his neck and kissed him, and took from his back the bundle of faggots, and brushed the snow off his boots, and bade him come in.But he said to her, ‘I have found something in the forest, and I have brought it to thee to have care of it,’ and he stirred not from the threshold.‘What is it?’ she cried.  ‘Show it to me, for the house is bare, and we have need of many things.’  And he drew the cloak back, and showed her the sleeping child.‘Alack, goodman!’ she murmured, ‘have we not children of our own, that thou must needs bring a changeling to sit by the hearth?  And who knows if it will not bring us bad fortune?  And how shall we tend it?’  And she was wroth against him.‘Nay, but it is a Star-Child,’ he answered; and he told her the strange manner of the finding of it.But she would not be appeased, but mocked at him, and spoke angrily, and cried: ‘Our children lack bread, and shall we feed the child of another?  Who is there who careth for us?  And who giveth us food?’‘Nay, but God careth for the sparrows even, and feedeth them,’ he answered.‘Do not the sparrows die of hunger in the winter?’ she asked.  ‘And is it not winter now?’And the man answered nothing, but stirred not from the threshold.And a bitter wind from the forest came in through the open door, and made her tremble, and she shivered, and said to him: ‘Wilt thou not close the door?  There cometh a bitter wind into the house, and I am cold.’‘Into a house where a heart is hard cometh there not always a bitter wind?’ he asked.  And the woman answered him nothing, but crept closer to the fire.And after a time she turned round and looked at him, and her eyes were full of tears.  And he came in swiftly, and placed the child in her arms, and she kissed it, and laid it in a little bed where the youngest of their own children was lying.  And on the morrow the Woodcutter took the curious cloak of gold and placed it in a great chest, and a chain of amber that was round the child’s neck his wife took and set it in the chest also.So the Star-Child was brought up with the children of the Woodcutter, and sat at the same board with them, and was their playmate.  And every year he became more beautiful to look at, so that all those who dwelt in the village were filled with wonder, for, while they were swarthy and black-haired, he was white and delicate as sawn ivory, and his curls were like the rings of the daffodil.  His lips, also, were like the petals of a red flower, and his eyes were like violets by a river of pure water, and his body like the narcissus of a field where the mower comes not.Yet did his beauty work him evil.  For he grew proud, and cruel, and selfish.  The children of the Woodcutter, and the other children of the village, he despised, saying that they were of mean parentage, while he was noble, being sprang from a Star, and he made himself master over them, and called them his servants.  No pity had he for the poor, or for those who were blind or maimed or in any way afflicted, but would cast stones at them and drive them forth on to the highway, and bid them beg their bread elsewhere, so that none save the outlaws came twice to that village to ask for alms.  Indeed, he was as one enamoured of beauty, and would mock at the weakly and ill-favoured, and make jest of them; and himself he loved, and in summer, when the winds were still, he would lie by the well in the priest’s orchard and look down at the marvel of his own face, and laugh for the pleasure he had in his fairness.Often did the Woodcutter and his wife chide him, and say: ‘We did not deal with thee as thou dealest with those who are left desolate, and have none to succour them.  Wherefore art thou so cruel to all who need pity?’Often did the old priest send for him, and seek to teach him the love of living things, saying to him: ‘The fly is thy brother.  Do it no harm.  The wild birds that roam through the forest have their freedom.  Snare them not for thy pleasure.  God made the blind-worm and the mole, and each has its place.  Who art thou to bring pain into God’s world?  Even the cattle of the field praise Him.’But the Star-Child heeded not their words, but would frown and flout, and go back to his companions, and lead them.  And his companions followed him, for he was fair, and fleet of foot, and could dance, and pipe, and make music.  And wherever the Star-Child led them they followed, and whatever the Star-Child bade them do, that did they.  And when he pierced with a sharp reed the dim eyes of the mole, they laughed, and when he cast stones at the leper they laughed also.  And in all things he ruled them, and they became hard of heart even as he was.Now there passed one day through the village a poor beggar-woman.  Her garments were torn and ragged, and her feet were bleeding from the rough road on which she had travelled, and she was in very evil plight.  And being weary she sat her down under a chestnut-tree to rest.But when the Star-Child saw her, he said to his companions, ‘See!  There sitteth a foul beggar-woman under that fair and green-leaved tree.  Come, let us drive her hence, for she is ugly and ill-favoured.’So he came near and threw stones at her, and mocked her, and she looked at him with terror in her eyes, nor did she move her gaze from him.  And when the Woodcutter, who was cleaving logs in a haggard hard by, saw what the Star-Child was doing, he ran up and rebuked him, and said to him: ‘Surely thou art hard of heart and knowest not mercy, for what evil has this poor woman done to thee that thou shouldst treat her in this wise?’And the Star-Child grew red with anger, and stamped his foot upon the ground, and said, ‘Who art thou to question me what I do?  I am no son of thine to do thy bidding.’‘Thou speakest truly,’ answered the Woodcutter, ‘yet did I show thee pity when I found thee in the forest.’And when the woman heard these words she gave a loud cry, and fell into a swoon.  And the Woodcutter carried her to his own house, and his wife had care of her, and when she rose up from the swoon into which she had fallen, they set meat and drink before her, and bade her have comfort.But she would neither eat nor drink, but said to the Woodcutter, ‘Didst thou not say that the child was found in the forest?  And was it not ten years from this day?’And the Woodcutter answered, ‘Yea, it was in the forest that I found him, and it is ten years from this day.’‘And what signs didst thou find with him?’ she cried.  ‘Bare he not upon his neck a chain of amber?  Was not round him a cloak of gold tissue broidered with stars?’‘Truly,’ answered the Woodcutter, ‘it was even as thou sayest.’  And he took the cloak and the amber chain from the chest where they lay, and showed them to her.And when she saw them she wept for joy, and said, ‘He is my little son whom I lost in the forest.  I pray thee send for him quickly, for in search of him have I wandered over the whole world.’So the Woodcutter and his wife went out and called to the Star-Child, and said to him, ‘Go into the house, and there shalt thou find thy mother, who is waiting for thee.’So he ran in, filled with wonder and great gladness.  But when he saw her who was waiting there, he laughed scornfully and said, ‘Why, where is my mother?  For I see none here but this vile beggar-woman.’And the woman answered him, ‘I am thy mother.’‘Thou art mad to say so,’ cried the Star-Child angrily.  ‘I am no son of thine, for thou art a beggar, and ugly, and in rags.  Therefore get thee hence, and let me see thy foul face no more.’‘Nay, but thou art indeed my little son, whom I bare in the forest,’ she cried, and she fell on her knees, and held out her arms to him.  ‘The robbers stole thee from me, and left thee to die,’ she murmured, ‘but I recognised thee when I saw thee, and the signs also have I recognised, the cloak of golden tissue and the amber chain.  Therefore I pray thee come with me, for over the whole world have I wandered in search of thee.  Come with me, my son, for I have need of thy love.’But the Star-Child stirred not from his place, but shut the doors of his heart against her, nor was there any sound heard save the sound of the woman weeping for pain.And at last he spoke to her, and his voice was hard and bitter.  ‘If in very truth thou art my mother,’ he said, ‘it had been better hadst thou stayed away, and not come here to bring me to shame, seeing that I thought I was the child of some Star, and not a beggar’s child, as thou tellest me that I am.  Therefore get thee hence, and let me see thee no more.’‘Alas! my son,’ she cried, ‘wilt thou not kiss me before I go?  For I have suffered much to find thee.’‘Nay,’ said the Star-Child, ‘but thou art too foul to look at, and rather would I kiss the adder or the toad than thee.’So the woman rose up, and went away into the forest weeping bitterly, and when the Star-Child saw that she had gone, he was glad, and ran back to his playmates that he might play with them.But when they beheld him coming, they mocked him and said, ‘Why, thou art as foul as the toad, and as loathsome as the adder.  Get thee hence, for we will not suffer thee to play with us,’ and they drave him out of the garden.And the Star-Child frowned and said to himself, ‘What is this that they say to me?  I will go to the well of water and look into it, and it shall tell me of my beauty.’So he went to the well of water and looked into it, and lo! his face was as the face of a toad, and his body was sealed like an adder.  And he flung himself down on the grass and wept, and said to himself, ‘Surely this has come upon me by reason of my sin.  For I have denied my mother, and driven her away, and been proud, and cruel to her.  Wherefore I will go and seek her through the whole world, nor will I rest till I have found her.’And there came to him the little daughter of the Woodcutter, and she put her hand upon his shoulder and said, ‘What doth it matter if thou hast lost thy comeliness?  Stay with us, and I will not mock at thee.’And he said to her, ‘Nay, but I have been cruel to my mother, and as a punishment has this evil been sent to me.  Wherefore I must go hence, and wander through the world till I find her, and she give me her forgiveness.’So he ran away into the forest and called out to his mother to come to him, but there was no answer.  All day long he called to her, and, when the sun set he lay down to sleep on a bed of leaves, and the birds and the animals fled from him, for they remembered his cruelty, and he was alone save for the toad that watched him, and the slow adder that crawled past.And in the morning he rose up, and plucked some bitter berries from the trees and ate them, and took his way through the great wood, weeping sorely.  And of everything that he met he made inquiry if perchance they had seen his mother.He said to the Mole, ‘Thou canst go beneath the earth.  Tell me, is my mother there?’And the Mole answered, ‘Thou hast blinded mine eyes.  How should I know?’He said to the Linnet, ‘Thou canst fly over the tops of the tall trees, and canst see the whole world.  Tell me, canst thou see my mother?’And the Linnet answered, ‘Thou hast clipt my wings for thy pleasure.  How should I fly?’And to the little Squirrel who lived in the fir-tree, and was lonely, he said, ‘Where is my mother?’And the Squirrel answered, ‘Thou hast slain mine.  Dost thou seek to slay thine also?’And the Star-Child wept and bowed his head, and prayed forgiveness of God’s things, and went on through the forest, seeking for the beggar-woman.  And on the third day he came to the other side of the forest and went down into the plain.And when he passed through the villages the children mocked him, and threw stones at him, and the carlots would not suffer him even to sleep in the byres lest he might bring mildew on the stored corn, so foul was he to look at, and their hired men drave him away, and there was none who had pity on him.  Nor could he hear anywhere of the beggar-woman who was his mother, though for the space of three years he wandered over the world, and often seemed to see her on the road in front of him, and would call to her, and run after her till the sharp flints made his feet to bleed.  But overtake her he could not, and those who dwelt by the way did ever deny that they had seen her, or any like to her, and they made sport of his sorrow.For the space of three years he wandered over the world, and in the world there was neither love nor loving-kindness nor charity for him, but it was even such a world as he had made for himself in the days of his great pride.And one evening he came to the gate of a strong-walled city that stood by a river, and, weary and footsore though he was, he made to enter in.  But the soldiers who stood on guard dropped their halberts across the entrance, and said roughly to him, ‘What is thy business in the city?’‘I am seeking for my mother,’ he answered, ‘and I pray ye to suffer me to pass, for it may be that she is in this city.’But they mocked at him, and one of them wagged a black beard, and set down his shield and cried, ‘Of a truth, thy mother will not be merry when she sees thee, for thou art more ill-favoured than the toad of the marsh, or the adder that crawls in the fen.  Get thee gone.  Get thee gone.  Thy mother dwells not in this city.’And another, who held a yellow banner in his hand, said to him, ‘Who is thy mother, and wherefore art thou seeking for her?’And he answered, ‘My mother is a beggar even as I am, and I have treated her evilly, and I pray ye to suffer me to pass that she may give me her forgiveness, if it be that she tarrieth in this city.’  But they would not, and pricked him with their spears.And, as he turned away weeping, one whose armour was inlaid with gilt flowers, and on whose helmet couched a lion that had wings, came up and made inquiry of the soldiers who it was who had sought entrance.  And they said to him, ‘It is a beggar and the child of a beggar, and we have driven him away.’‘Nay,’ he cried, laughing, ‘but we will sell the foul thing for a slave, and his price shall be the price of a bowl of sweet wine.’And an old and evil-visaged man who was passing by called out, and said, ‘I will buy him for that price,’ and, when he had paid the price, he took the Star-Child by the hand and led him into the city.And after that they had gone through many streets they came to a little door that was set in a wall that was covered with a pomegranate tree.  And the old man touched the door with a ring of graved jasper and it opened, and they went down five steps of brass into a garden filled with black poppies and green jars of burnt clay.  And the old man took then from his turban a scarf of figured silk, and bound with it the eyes of the Star-Child, and drave him in front of him.  And when the scarf was taken off his eyes, the Star-Child found himself in a dungeon, that was lit by a lantern of horn.And the old man set before him some mouldy bread on a trencher and said, ‘Eat,’ and some brackish water in a cup and said, ‘Drink,’ and when he had eaten and drunk, the old man went out, locking the door behind him and fastening it with an iron chain.And on the morrow the old man, who was indeed the subtlest of the magicians of Libya and had learned his art from one who dwelt in the tombs of the Nile, came in to him and frowned at him, and said, ‘In a wood that is nigh to the gate of this city of Giaours there are three pieces of gold.  One is of white gold, and another is of yellow gold, and the gold of the third one is red.  To-day thou shalt bring me the piece of white gold, and if thou bringest it not back, I will beat thee with a hundred stripes.  Get thee away quickly, and at sunset I will be waiting for thee at the door of the garden.  See that thou bringest the white gold, or it shall go ill with thee, for thou art my slave, and I have bought thee for the price of a bowl of sweet wine.’  And he bound the eyes of the Star-Child with the scarf of figured silk, and led him through the house, and through the garden of poppies, and up the five steps of brass.  And having opened the little door with his ring he set him in the street.And the Star-Child went out of the gate of the city, and came to the wood of which the Magician had spoken to him.Now this wood was very fair to look at from without, and seemed full of singing birds and of sweet-scented flowers, and the Star-Child entered it gladly.  Yet did its beauty profit him little, for wherever he went harsh briars and thorns shot up from the ground and encompassed him, and evil nettles stung him, and the thistle pierced him with her daggers, so that he was in sore distress.  Nor could he anywhere find the piece of white gold of which the Magician had spoken, though he sought for it from morn to noon, and from noon to sunset.  And at sunset he set his face towards home, weeping bitterly, for he knew what fate was in store for him.But when he had reached the outskirts of the wood, he heard from a thicket a cry as of some one in pain.  And forgetting his own sorrow he ran back to the place, and saw there a little Hare caught in a trap that some hunter had set for it.And the Star-Child had pity on it, and released it, and said to it, ‘I am myself but a slave, yet may I give thee thy freedom.’And the Hare answered him, and said: ‘Surely thou hast given me freedom, and what shall I give thee in return?’And the Star-Child said to it, ‘I am seeking for a piece of white gold, nor can I anywhere find it, and if I bring it not to my master he will beat me.’‘Come thou with me,’ said the Hare, ‘and I will lead thee to it, for I know where it is hidden, and for what purpose.’So the Star-Child went with the Hare, and lo! in the cleft of a great oak-tree he saw the piece of white gold that he was seeking.  And he was filled with joy, and seized it, and said to the Hare, ‘The service that I did to thee thou hast rendered back again many times over, and the kindness that I showed thee thou hast repaid a hundred-fold.’‘Nay,’ answered the Hare, ‘but as thou dealt with me, so I did deal with thee,’ and it ran away swiftly, and the Star-Child went towards the city.Now at the gate of the city there was seated one who was a leper.  Over his face hung a cowl of grey linen, and through the eyelets his eyes gleamed like red coals.  And when he saw the Star-Child coming, he struck upon a wooden bowl, and clattered his bell, and called out to him, and said, ‘Give me a piece of money, or I must die of hunger.  For they have thrust me out of the city, and there is no one who has pity on me.’‘Alas!’ cried the Star-Child, ‘I have but one piece of money in my wallet, and if I bring it not to my master he will beat me, for I am his slave.’But the leper entreated him, and prayed of him, till the Star-Child had pity, and gave him the piece of white gold.And when he came to the Magician’s house, the Magician opened to him, and brought him in, and said to him, ‘Hast thou the piece of white gold?’  And the Star-Child answered, ‘I have it not.’  So the Magician fell upon him, and beat him, and set before him an empty trencher, and said, ‘Eat,’ and an empty cup, and said, ‘Drink,’ and flung him again into the dungeon.And on the morrow the Magician came to him, and said, ‘If to-day thou bringest me not the piece of yellow gold, I will surely keep thee as my slave, and give thee three hundred stripes.’So the Star-Child went to the wood, and all day long he searched for the piece of yellow gold, but nowhere could he find it.  And at sunset he sat him down and began to weep, and as he was weeping there came to him the little Hare that he had rescued from the trap.And the Hare said to him, ‘Why art thou weeping?  And what dost thou seek in the wood?’And the Star-Child answered, ‘I am seeking for a piece of yellow gold that is hidden here, and if I find it not my master will beat me, and keep me as a slave.’‘Follow me,’ cried the Hare, and it ran through the wood till it came to a pool of water.  And at the bottom of the pool the piece of yellow gold was lying.‘How shall I thank thee?’ said the Star-Child, ‘for lo! this is the second time that you have succoured me.’‘Nay, but thou hadst pity on me first,’ said the Hare, and it ran away swiftly.And the Star-Child took the piece of yellow gold, and put it in his wallet, and hurried to the city.  But the leper saw him coming, and ran to meet him, and knelt down and cried, ‘Give me a piece of money or I shall die of hunger.’And the Star-Child said to him, ‘I have in my wallet but one piece of yellow gold, and if I bring it not to my master he will beat me and keep me as his slave.’But the leper entreated him sore, so that the Star-Child had pity on him, and gave him the piece of yellow gold.And when he came to the Magician’s house, the Magician opened to him, and brought him in, and said to him, ‘Hast thou the piece of yellow gold?’  And the Star-Child said to him, ‘I have it not.’  So the Magician fell upon him, and beat him, and loaded him with chains, and cast him again into the dungeon.And on the morrow the Magician came to him, and said, ‘If to-day thou bringest me the piece of red gold I will set thee free, but if thou bringest it not I will surely slay thee.’So the Star-Child went to the wood, and all day long he searched for the piece of red gold, but nowhere could he find it.  And at evening he sat him down and wept, and as he was weeping there came to him the little Hare.And the Hare said to him, ‘The piece of red gold that thou seekest is in the cavern that is behind thee.  Therefore weep no more but be glad.’‘How shall I reward thee?’ cried the Star-Child, ‘for lo! this is the third time thou hast succoured me.’‘Nay, but thou hadst pity on me first,’ said the Hare, and it ran away swiftly.And the Star-Child entered the cavern, and in its farthest corner he found the piece of red gold.  So he put it in his wallet, and hurried to the city.  And the leper seeing him coming, stood in the centre of the road, and cried out, and said to him, ‘Give me the piece of red money, or I must die,’ and the Star-Child had pity on him again, and gave him the piece of red gold, saying, ‘Thy need is greater than mine.’  Yet was his heart heavy, for he knew what evil fate awaited him.But lo! as he passed through the gate of the city, the guards bowed down and made obeisance to him, saying, ‘How beautiful is our lord!’ and a crowd of citizens followed him, and cried out, ‘Surely there is none so beautiful in the whole world!’ so that the Star-Child wept, and said to himself, ‘They are mocking me, and making light of my misery.’  And so large was the concourse of the people, that he lost the threads of his way, and found himself at last in a great square, in which there was a palace of a King.And the gate of the palace opened, and the priests and the high officers of the city ran forth to meet him, and they abased themselves before him, and said, ‘Thou art our lord for whom we have been waiting, and the son of our King.’And the Star-Child answered them and said, ‘I am no king’s son, but the child of a poor beggar-woman.  And how say ye that I am beautiful, for I know that I am evil to look at?’Then he, whose armour was inlaid with gilt flowers, and on whose helmet crouched a lion that had wings, held up a shield, and cried, ‘How saith my lord that he is not beautiful?’And the Star-Child looked, and lo! his face was even as it had been, and his comeliness had come back to him, and he saw that in his eyes which he had not seen there before.And the priests and the high officers knelt down and said to him, ‘It was prophesied of old that on this day should come he who was to rule over us.  Therefore, let our lord take this crown and this sceptre, and be in his justice and mercy our King over us.’But he said to them, ‘I am not worthy, for I have denied the mother who bare me, nor may I rest till I have found her, and known her forgiveness.  Therefore, let me go, for I must wander again over the world, and may not tarry here, though ye bring me the crown and the sceptre.’  And as he spake he turned his face from them towards the street that led to the gate of the city, and lo! amongst the crowd that pressed round the soldiers, he saw the beggar-woman who was his mother, and at her side stood the leper, who had sat by the road.And a cry of joy broke from his lips, and he ran over, and kneeling down he kissed the wounds on his mother’s feet, and wet them with his tears.  He bowed his head in the dust, and sobbing, as one whose heart might break, he said to her: ‘Mother, I denied thee in the hour of my pride.  Accept me in the hour of my humility.  Mother, I gave thee hatred.  Do thou give me love.  Mother, I rejected thee.  Receive thy child now.’  But the beggar-woman answered him not a word.And he reached out his hands, and clasped the white feet of the leper, and said to him: ‘Thrice did I give thee of my mercy.  Bid my mother speak to me once.’  But the leper answered him not a word.And he sobbed again and said: ‘Mother, my suffering is greater than I can bear.  Give me thy forgiveness, and let me go back to the forest.’  And the beggar-woman put her hand on his head, and said to him, ‘Rise,’ and the leper put his hand on his head, and said to him, ‘Rise,’ also.And he rose up from his feet, and looked at them, and lo! they were a King and a Queen.And the Queen said to him, ‘This is thy father whom thou hast succoured.’And the King said, ‘This is thy mother whose feet thou hast washed with thy tears.’  And they fell on his neck and kissed him, and brought him into the palace and clothed him in fair raiment, and set the crown upon his head, and the sceptre in his hand, and over the city that stood by the river he ruled, and was its lord.  Much justice and mercy did he show to all, and the evil Magician he banished, and to the Woodcutter and his wife he sent many rich gifts, and to their children he gave high honour.  Nor would he suffer any to be cruel to bird or beast, but taught love and loving-kindness and charity, and to the poor he gave bread, and to the naked he gave raiment, and there was peace and plenty in the land.Yet ruled he not long, so great had been his suffering, and so bitter the fire of his testing, for after the space of three years he died.  And he who came after him ruled evilly.","['balance', 'rock', 'roll', 'rock', 'near',

1758,irish,"The Son of the King of Erin, and the Giant of Loch Léin","On a time there lived a king and a queen in Erin, and they had an only son. They were very careful and fond of this son; whatever he asked for was granted, and what he wanted he had.When grown to be almost a young man the son went away one day to the hills to hunt. He could find no game,—saw nothing all day. Towards evening he sat down on a hillside to rest, but soon stood up again and started to go home empty-handed. Then he heard a whistle behind him, and turning, saw a giant hurrying down the hill.The giant came to him, took his hand, and said: “Can you play cards?”“I can indeed,” said the king’s son.“Well, if you can,” said the giant, “we’ll have a game here on this hillside.”So the two sat down, and the giant had out a pack of cards in a twinkling. “What shall we play for?” asked the giant.“For two estates,” answered the king’s son.They played: the young man won, and went home the better for two estates. He was very glad, and hurried to tell his father the luck he had.Next day he went to the same place, and didn’t wait long till the giant came again.“Welcome, king’s son,” said the giant. “What shall we play for to-day?”“I’ll leave that to yourself,” answered the young man.“Well,” said the giant, “I have five hundred bullocks with golden horns and silver hoofs, and I’ll play them against as many cattle belonging to you.”“Agreed,” said the king’s son.They played. The giant lost again. He had the cattle brought to the place; and the king’s son went home with the five hundred bullocks. The king his father was outside watching, and was more delighted than the day before when he saw the drove of beautiful cattle with horns of gold and hoofs of silver.When the bullocks were driven in, the king sent for the old blind sage (Sean dall Glic), to know what he would say of the young man’s luck.“My advice,” said the old blind sage, “is not to let your son go the way of the giant again, for if he plays with him a third time he’ll rue it.”But nothing could keep the king’s son from playing the third time. Away he went, in spite of every advice and warning, and sat on the same hillside.He waited long, but no one came. At last he rose to go home. That moment he heard a whistle behind him, and turning, saw the giant coming.“Well, will you play with me to-day?” asked the giant.“I would,” said the king’s son, “but I have nothing to bet.”“You have indeed.”“I have not,” said the king’s son.“Haven’t you your head?” asked the giant of Loch Léin, for it was he that was in it.“I have,” answered the king’s son.“So have I my head,” said the giant; “and we’ll play for each other’s heads.”This third time the giant won the game; and the king’s son was to give himself up in a year and a day to the giant in his castle.The young man went home sad and weary. The king and queen were outside watching, and when they saw him approaching, they knew great trouble was on him. When he came to where they were, he wouldn’t speak, but went straight into the castle, and wouldn’t eat or drink.He was sad and lamenting for a good while, till at last he disappeared one day, the king and queen knew not whither. After that they didn’t hear of him,—didn’t know was he dead or alive.The young man after he left home was walking along over the kingdom for a long time. One day he saw no house, big or little, till after dark he came in front of a hill, and at the foot of the hill saw a small light. He went to the light, found a small house, and inside an old woman sitting at a warm fire, and every tooth in her head as long as a staff.She stood up when he entered, took him by the hand, and said, “You are welcome to my house, son of the king of Erin.” Then she brought warm water, washed his feet and legs from the knees down, gave him supper, and put him to bed.When he rose next morning he found breakfast ready before him. The old woman said: “You were with me last night; you’ll be with my sister to-night, and what she tells you to do, do, or your head’ll be in danger. Now take the gift I give you. Here is a ball of thread: do you throw it in front of you before you start, and all day the ball will be rolling ahead of you, and you’ll be following behind winding the thread into another ball.”He obeyed the old woman, threw the ball down, and followed. All the day he was going up hill and down, across valleys and open places, keeping the ball in sight and winding the thread as he went, till evening, when he saw a hill in front, and a small light at the foot of it.He went to the light and found a house, which he entered. There was no one inside but an old woman with teeth as long as a crutch.“Oh! then you are welcome to my house, king’s son of Erin,” said she. “You were with my sister last night; you are with me to-night; and it’s glad I am to see you.”She gave him meat and drink and a good bed to lie on.When he rose next morning breakfast was there before him, and when he had eaten and was ready for the journey, the old woman gave him a ball of thread, saying: “You were with my younger sister the night before last; you were with me last night; and you’ll be with my elder sister to-night. You must do what she tells you, or you’ll lose your head. You must throw this ball before you, and follow the clew till evening.”He threw down the ball: it rolled on, showing the way up and down mountains and hills, across valleys and braes. All day he wound the ball; unceasingly it went till nightfall, when he came to a light, found a little house, and went in. Inside was an old woman, the eldest sister, who said: “You are welcome, and glad am I to see you, king’s son.”She treated him as well as the other two had done. After he had eaten breakfast next morning, she said:—“I know well the journey you are on. You have lost your head to the Giant of Loch Léin, and you are going to give yourself up. This giant has a great castle. Around the castle are seven hundred iron spikes, and on every spike of them but one is the head of a king, a queen, or a king’s son. The seven hundredth spike is empty, and nothing can save your head from that spike if you don’t take my advice.“Here is a ball for you: walk behind it till you come to a lake near the giant’s castle. When you come to that lake at midday the ball will be unwound.“The giant has three young daughters, and they come at noon every day of the year to bathe in the lake. You must watch them well, for each will have a lily on her breast,—one a blue, another a white, and the third a yellow lily. You mustn’t let your eyes off the one with the yellow lily. Watch her well: when she undresses to go into the water, see where she puts her clothes; when the three are out in the lake swimming, do you slip away with the clothes of Yellow Lily.“When the sisters come out from bathing, and find that the one with the yellow lily has lost her clothes, the other two will laugh and make game of her, and she will crouch down crying on the shore, with nothing to cover her, and say, ‘How can I go home now, and everybody making sport of me? Whoever took my clothes, if he’ll give them back to me, I’ll save him from the danger he is in, if I have the power.'”The king’s son followed the ball till nearly noon, when it stopped at a lake not far from the giant’s castle. Then he hid behind a rock at the water’s edge, and waited.At midday the three sisters came to the lake, and, leaving their clothes on the strand, went into the water. When all three were in the lake swimming and playing with great pleasure and sport, the king’s son slipped out and took the clothes of the sister with the yellow lily.After they had bathed in the lake to their hearts’ content, the three sisters came out. When the two with the blue and the white lilies saw their sister on the shore and her clothes gone, they began to laugh and make sport of her. Then, cowering and crouching down, she began to cry and lament, saying: “How can I go home now, with my own sisters laughing at me? If I stir from this, everybody will see me and make sport of me.”The sisters went home and left her there. When they were gone, and she was alone at the water crying and sobbing, all at once she came to herself and called out: “Whoever took my clothes, I’ll forgive him if he brings them to me now, and I’ll save him from the danger he is in if I can.”When he heard this, the king’s son put the clothes out to her, and stayed behind himself till she told him to come forth.Then she said: “I know well where you are going. My father, the Giant of Loch Léin, has a soft bed waiting for you,—a deep tank of water for your death. But don’t be uneasy; go into the water, and wait till I come to save you. Be at that castle above before my father. When he comes home to-night and asks for you, take no meat from him, but go to rest in the tank when he tells you.”The giant’s daughter left the king’s son, who went his way to the castle alone at a fair and easy gait, for he had time enough on his hands and to spare.When the Giant of Loch Léin came home that night, the first question he asked was, “Is the son of the king of Erin here?”“I am,” said the king’s son.“Come,” said the giant, “and get your evening’s meat.”“I’ll take no meat now, for I don’t need it,” said the king’s son.“Well, come with me then, and I’ll show you your bed.” He went, and the giant put the king’s son into the deep tank of water to drown, and being tired himself from hunting all day over the mountains and hills of Erin, he went to sleep.That minute his youngest daughter came, took the king’s son out of the tank, placed plenty to eat and to drink before him, and gave him a good bed to sleep on that night.The giant’s daughter watched till she heard her father stirring before daybreak; then she roused the king’s son, and put him in the tank again.Soon the giant came to the tank and called out: “Are you here, son of the king of Erin?”“I am,” said the king’s son.“Well, come out now. There is a great work for you to-day. I have a stable outside, in which I keep five hundred horses, and that stable has not been cleaned these seven hundred years. My great-grandmother when a girl lost a slumber-pin (bar an suan) somewhere in that stable, and never could find it. You must have that pin for me when I come home to-night; if you don’t, your head will be on the seven hundredth spike to-morrow.”Then two shovels were brought for him to choose from to clean out the stable, an old and a new one. He chose the new shovel, and went to work.For every shovelful he threw out, two came in; and soon the door of the stable was closed on him. When the stable-door was closed, the giant’s daughter called from outside: “How are you thriving now, king’s son?”“I’m not thriving at all,” said the king’s son; “for as much as I throw out, twice as much comes in, and the door is closed against me.”“You must make a way for me to come in, and I’ll help you,” said she.“How can I do that?” asked the king’s son.However, she did it. The giant’s daughter made her way into the stable, and she wasn’t long inside till the stable was cleared, and she saw the bar an suan.“There is the pin over there in the corner,” said she to the king’s son, who put it in his bosom to give to the giant.Now he was happy, and the giant’s daughter had good meat and drink put before him.When the giant himself came home, he asked: “How did you do your work to-day?”“I did it well; I thought nothing of it.”“Did you find the bar an suan?”“I did indeed; here ’tis for you.”“Oh! then,” said the giant, “it is either the devil or my daughter that helped you to do that work, for I know you never did it alone.”“It’s neither the devil nor your daughter, but my own strength that did the work,” said the son of the king of Erin.“You have done the work; now you must have your meat.” “I want no meat to-day; I am well satisfied as I am,” said the king’s son.“Well,” said the giant, “since you’ll have no meat, you must go to sleep in the tank.”He went into the tank. The giant himself was soon snoring, for he was tired from hunting over Erin all day.The moment her father was away, Yellow Lily came, took the king’s son out of the tank, gave him a good supper and bed, and watched till the giant was stirring before daybreak. Then she roused the king’s son and put him in the tank.“Are you alive in the tank?” asked the giant at daybreak.“I am,” said the king’s son.“Well, you have a great work before you to-day. That stable you cleaned yesterday hasn’t been thatched these seven hundred years, and if you don’t have it thatched for me when I come home to-night, with birds’ feathers, and not two feathers of one color or kind, I’ll have your head on the seven hundredth spike to-morrow.”“Here are two whistles,—an old, and a new one; take your choice of them to call the birds.”The king’s son took the new whistle, and set out over the hills and valleys, whistling as he went. But no matter how he whistled, not a bird came near him. At last, tired and worn out with travelling and whistling, he sat down on a hillock and began to cry.That moment Yellow Lily was at his side with a cloth, which she spread out, and there was a grand meal before him. He hadn’t finished eating and drinking, before the stable was thatched with birds’ feathers, and no two of them of one color or kind.When he came home that evening the giant called out: “Have you the stable thatched for me to-night?”“I have indeed,” said the king’s son; “and small trouble I had with it.”“If that’s true,” said the giant, “either the devil or my daughter helped you.”“It was my own strength, and not the devil or your daughter that helped me,” said the king’s son.He spent that night as he had the two nights before.Next morning, when the giant found him alive in the tank, he said: “There is great work before you to-day, which you must do, or your head’ll be on the spike to-morrow. Below here, under my castle, is a tree nine hundred feet high, and there isn’t a limb on that tree, from the roots up, except one small limb at the very top, where there is a crow’s nest. The tree is covered with glass from the ground to the crow’s nest. In the nest is one egg: you must have that egg before me here for my supper to-night, or I’ll have your head on the seven hundredth spike to-morrow.”The giant went hunting, and the king’s son went down to the tree, tried to shake it, but could not make it stir. Then he tried to climb; but no use, it was all slippery glass. Then he thought, “Sure I’m done for now; I must lose my head this time.”He stood there in sadness, when Yellow Lily came, and said: “How are you thriving in your work?”“I can do nothing,” said the king’s son.“Well, all that we have done up to this time is nothing to climbing this tree. But first of all let us sit down together and eat, and then we’ll talk,” said Yellow Lily.They sat down, she spread the cloth again, and they had a splendid feast. When the feast was over she took out a knife from her pocket and said:—“Now you must kill me, strip the flesh from my bones, take all the bones apart, and use them as steps for climbing the tree. When you are climbing the tree, they will stick to the glass as if they had grown out of it; but when you are coming down, and have put your foot on each one, they will drop into your hand when you touch them. Be sure and stand on each bone, leave none untouched; if you do, it will stay behind. Put all my flesh into this clean cloth by the side of the spring at the roots of the tree. When you come to the earth, arrange my bones together, put the flesh over them, sprinkle it with water from the spring, and I shall be alive and well before you. But don’t forget a bone of me on the tree.”“How could I kill you,” asked the king’s son, “after what you have done for me?”“If you won’t obey, you and I are done for,” said Yellow Lily. “You must climb the tree, or we are lost; and to climb the tree you must do as I say.”The king’s son obeyed. He killed Yellow Lily, cut the flesh from her body, and unjointed the bones, as she had told him.As he went up, the king’s son put the bones of Yellow Lily’s body against the side of the tree, using them as steps, till he came under the nest and stood on the last bone.Then he took the crow’s egg; and coming down, put his foot on every bone, then took it with him, till he came to the last bone, which was so near the ground that he failed to touch it with his foot.He now placed all the bones of Yellow Lily in order again at the side of the spring, put the flesh on them, sprinkled it with water from the spring. She rose up before him, and said: “Didn’t I tell you not to leave a bone of my body without stepping on it? Now I am lame for life! You left my little toe on the tree without touching it, and I have but nine toes.”When the giant came home that night, the first words he had were, “Have you the crow’s egg for my supper?”“I have,” said the king’s son.“If you have, then either the devil or my daughter is helping you.”“It is my own strength that’s helping me,” said the king’s son.“Well, whoever it is, I must forgive you now, and your head is your own.”So the king’s son was free to go his own road, and away he went, and never stopped till he came home to his own father and mother, who had a great welcome before him; and why not? for they thought he was dead.When the son was at home a time, the king called up the old blind sage, and asked, “What must I do with my son now?”“If you follow my advice,” said the old blind sage, “you’ll find a wife for him; and then he’ll not go roaming away again, and leave you as he did before.”The king was pleased with the advice, and he sent a message to the king of Lochlin to ask his daughter in marriage.The king of Lochlin came with the daughter and a ship full of attendants, and there was to be a grand wedding at the castle of the king of Erin. Now, the king’s son asked his father to invite the Giant of Loch Léin and Yellow Lily to the wedding. The king sent messages for them to come.The day before the marriage there was a great feast at the castle. As the feast went on, and all were merry, the Giant of Loch Léin said: “I never was at a place like this but one man sang a song, a second told a story, and the third played a trick.”Then the king of Erin sang a song, the king of Lochlin told a story, and when the turn came to the giant, he asked Yellow Lily to take his place.She threw two grains of wheat in the air, and there came down on the table two pigeons. The cock pigeon pecked at the hen and pushed her off the table. Then the hen called out to him in a human voice, “You wouldn’t do that to me the day I cleaned the stable for you.”Next time Yellow Lily put two grains of wheat on the table. The cock ate the wheat, pecked the hen, and pushed her off the table to the floor. The hen said: “You would not do that to me the day I thatched the stable for you with birds’ feathers, and not two of one color or kind.”The third time Yellow Lily put two more grains of wheat on the table. The cock ate both, and pushed the hen off to the floor. Then the hen called out: “You wouldn’t do that to me the day you killed me and took my bones to make steps up the glass tree nine hundred feet high to get the crow’s egg for the supper of the Giant of Loch Léin, and forget my little toe when you were coming down, and left me lame for life.”“Well,” said the king’s son to the guests at the feast, “when I was a little younger than I am now, I used to be everywhere in the world sporting and gaming; and once when I was away, I lost the key of a casket that I had. I had a new key made, and after it was brought to me I found the old one. Now, I’ll leave it to any one here to tell what am I to do,—which of the keys should I keep?”“My advice to you,” said the king of Lochlin, “is to keep the old key, for it fits the lock better, and you’re more used to it.”Then the king’s son stood up and said: “I thank you, king of Lochlin, for a wise advice and an honest word. This is my bride, the daughter of the Giant of Loch Léin. I’ll have her, and no other woman. Your daughter is my father’s guest, and no worse, but better, for having come to a wedding in Erin.”The king’s son married Yellow Lily, daughter of the Giant of Loch Léin, the wedding lasted long, and all were happy.","['trouble', 'fish', 'world', 'wave', 'indeed', 'every', 'creature', 'tail', 'distress', 'king', 'fish', 'sufiering', 'dreadful', 'pain', 'mouth', 'come', 'swim', 'around', 'water',

1796,irish,The Legend of Knockfierna,"It is a very good thing not to be any way in dread of the fairies, for without doubt they have then less power over a person ; but to make too free with them, or to disbelieve in them altogether, is as foolish a thing as man, woman, or child can do.It has been truly said, that “good manners are no burthen,” and that ” civility costs nothing;” but there are some people foolhardy enough to disregard doing a civil thing, which, whatever they may think, can never harm themselves or any one else, and who at the same time will go out of their way for a bit of mischief, which never can serve them; but sooner or later they will come to know better, as you shall hear of Carroll O’Daly, a strapping young fellow up out of Connaught, whom they used to call, in his own country, ” Devil Daly.”Carroll O’Daly used to go roving about from one place to another, and the fear of nothing stopped him; he would as soon pass an churchyard or a regular fairy ground, at any hour of the night, as go from one room into another without ever making the sign of the cross, or saying, ” Good luck attend you, gentlemen.”It so happened that he was once journeying, in the county of Limerick, towards ” the Balbec of Ireland,” the venerable town of Kilmallock; and just at the foot of Knockfierna he overtook a respectable4ooking man jogging along upon a white pony. The night wag coming on, and they rode side by side for some time, without much conversation passing between them, further than saluting each other very kindly; at last, Carroll O’Daly asked his companion how far he was going?Not far your way,” said the farmer, for such his appearance bespoke him; ” I’m only going to the top of this hill here.”“And what might take you there,” said O’Daly, “at this time of the night?”“Why then,” replied the farmer,” if you want to know; ’tis the good people.”The fairies, you mean,” said O’Daly.” Whist I whist!” said his fellow-traveller, ” or you may be sorry for it;” and he turned his pony off the road they were going towards a little path which led up the side of the mountain, wishing Carrol O’Daly good night and a safe journey.That fellow,” thought Carroll, ” is about no good this blessed night, and I would have no fear of swearing wrong if I took my Bible oath, that it is something else beside the fairies, or the good people, as he calls them, that is taking him up the mountain at this hour. The fairies!” he repeated, ” is it for a well shaped man like him to be going after little chaps like the fairies! to be sure some say there are such things, and more say not; but I know this, that never afraid would I be of a dozen of them, ay, of two dozen, for that matter, if they are no bigger than what I hear tell of.”Carroll O’Daly, whilst these thoughts were passing in his mind, had fixed his eyes steadfastly on the mountain, behind which the full moon was rising majestically. Upon an elevated point that appeared darkly against the moon’s disk, he beheld the figure of a man leading a pony, and he had no doubt it was that of the farmer with whom he had just parted company.A sudden resolve to follow flashed across the mind of O’Daly with the speed of lightning: both his courage and curiosity had been worked up by his cogitations to a pitch of chivalry; and, muttering “Here’s after you, old boy!” he dismounted from his horse, bound him to an old thorn tree, and then commenced vigorously ascending the mountain.Following as well as he could the direction taken by the figures of the man and pony, he pursued his way, occasionally guided by their partial appearance: and, after toiling nearly three hours over a rugged and sometimes swampy path, came to a green spot on the top of the mountain, where he saw the white pony at full liberty grazing as quietly as may be. O’Daly looked around for the rider, but he was nowhere to be seen; he, however, soon discovered close to where the pony stood an opening in the mountain like the mouth of a pit, and he remembered having heard, when a child, many a tale about the “Poul-duve,” or Black Hole of Knockfierna; how it was the entrance to tbe fairy castle which was within the mountain; and how a man whose name was Ahern, a land-surveyor in that part of the country, had once attempted to fathom it with a line, and had been drawn down into it and was never again heard of; with many other tales of the like nature.“But,” thought O’Daly, “these are old woman’s stories; and since I’ve come up so far, I’ll just knock at the castle door and see if the fairies are at home.”No sooner said than done; for, seizing a large stone, as big, ay, bigger than his two hands, he flung it with all his strength down into the Poul-duve of Knockfierna. He heard it bounding and tumbling about from one rock to another with a terrible noise, and he leant his head over to try and hear when it would reach the bottom, – and what should the very stone he had thrown in do but come up again with as much force as it had gone down, and gave him such a blow full in the face, that it sent him rolling down the side of Knockfierna, head over heels, tumbling from one crag to another, much faster than he came up. And in the morning Carroll O’Daly was found lying beside his horse; the bridge of his nose broken, which disfigured him for life ; his head all cut and bruised, and both his eyes closed up, and as black as if Sir Daniel Donnelly had painted them for him.Carroll O’Daly was never bold again in riding alone near the haunts of the fairies after dusk; but small blame to him for that; and if ever he happened to be benighted in a lonesome place, he would make the best of his way to his journey’s end, without asking questions, or turning to the right or to the left, to seek after the good people, or any who kept company with them.","['upon', 'time', 'poor', 'poor', 'sell', 'thing', 'another', 'food', 'keep', 'starve', 'nothing', 'left', 'except', 'fond', 'come', 'never', 'part', 'would',

1802,irish,The Three Daughters of King O'Hara,"There was a king in Desmond whose name was Coluath O’Hara, and he had three daughters. On a time when the king was away from home, the eldest daughter took a thought that she’d like to be married. So she went up in the castle, put on the cloak of darkness which her father had, and wished for the most beautiful man under the sun as a husband for herself.She got her wish; for scarcely had she put off the cloak of darkness, when there came, in a golden coach with four horses, two black and two white, the finest man she had ever laid eyes on, and took her away.When the second daughter saw what had happened to her sister, she put on the cloak of darkness, and wished for the next best man in the world as a husband.She put off the cloak; and straightway there came, in a golden coach with four black horses, a man nearly as good as the first, and took her away.The third sister put on the cloak, and wished for the best white dog in the world.Presently he came, with one man attending, in a golden coach and four snow-white horses, and took the youngest sister away.When the king came home, the stable-boy told him what had happened while he was gone. He was enraged beyond measure when he heard that his youngest daughter had wished for a white dog, and gone off with him.When the first man brought his wife home he asked: “In what form will you have me in the daytime,—as I am now in the daytime, or as I am now at night?”“As you are now in the daytime.”So the first sister had her husband as a man in the daytime; but at night he was a seal.The second man put the same question to the middle sister, and got the same answer; so the second sister had her husband in the same form as the first.When the third sister came to where the white dog lived, he asked her: “How will you have me to be in the daytime,—as I am now in the day, or as I am now at night?”“As you are now in the day.”So the white dog was a dog in the daytime, but the most beautiful of men at night.After a time the third sister had a son; and one day, when her husband was going out to hunt, he warned her that if anything should happen the child, not to shed a tear on that account.While he was gone, a great gray crow that used to haunt the place came and carried the child away when it was a week old.Remembering the warning, she shed not a tear for the loss.All went on as before till another son was born. The husband used to go hunting every day, and again he said she must not shed a tear if anything happened.When the child was a week old a great gray crow came and bore him away; but the mother did not cry or drop a tear.All went well till a daughter was born. When she was a week old a great gray crow came and swept her away. This time the mother dropped one tear on a handkerchief, which she took out of her pocket, and then put back again.When the husband came home from hunting and heard what the crow had done, he asked the wife, “Have you shed tears this time?”“I have dropped one tear,” said she.Then he was very angry; for he knew what harm she had done by dropping that one tear.Soon after their father invited the three sisters to visit him and be present at a great feast in their honor. They sent messages, each from her own place, that they would come.The king was very glad at the prospect of seeing his children; but the queen was grieved, and thought it a great disgrace that her youngest daughter had no one to come home with her but a white dog.The white dog was in dread that the king wouldn’t leave him inside with the company, but would drive him from the castle to the yard, and that the dogs outside wouldn’t leave a patch of skin on his back, but would tear the life out of him.The youngest daughter comforted him. “There is no danger to you,” said she, “for wherever I am, you’ll be, and wherever you go, I’ll follow and take care of you.”When all was ready for the feast at the castle, and the company were assembled, the king was for banishing the white dog; but the youngest daughter would not listen to her father,—would not let the white dog out of her sight, but kept him near her at the feast, and divided with him the food that came to herself.When the feast was over, and all the guests had gone, the three sisters went to their own rooms in the castle.Late in the evening the queen took the cook with her, and stole in to see what was in her daughters’ rooms. They were all asleep at the time. What should she see by the side of her youngest daughter but the most beautiful man she had ever laid eyes on.Then she went to where the other two daughters were sleeping; and there, instead of the two men who brought them to the feast, were two seals, fast asleep.The queen was greatly troubled at the sight of the seals. When she and the cook were returning, they came upon the skin of the white dog. She caught it up as she went, and threw it into the kitchen fire.The skin was not five minutes in the fire when it gave a crack that woke not only all in the castle, but all in the country for miles around.The husband of the youngest daughter sprang up. He was very angry and very sorry, and said: “If I had been able to spend three nights with you under your father’s roof, I should have got back my own form again for good, and could have been a man both in the day and the night; but now I must go.”He rose from the bed, ran out of the castle, and away he went as fast as ever his two legs could carry him, overtaking the one before him, and leaving the one behind. He was this way all that night and the next day; but he couldn’t leave the wife, for she followed from the castle, was after him in the night and the day too, and never lost sight of him. In the afternoon he turned, and told her to go back to her father; but she would not listen to him. At nightfall they came to the first house they had seen since leaving the castle. He turned and said: “Do you go inside and stay in this house till morning; I’ll pass the night outside where I am.”The wife went in. The woman of the house rose up, gave her a pleasant welcome, and put a good supper before her. She was not long in the house when a little boy came to her knee and called her “Mother.”The woman of the house told the child to go back to his place, and not to come out again.“Here are a pair of scissors,” said the woman of the house to the king’s daughter, “and they will serve you well. Whatever ragged people you see, if you cut a piece off their rags, that moment they will have new clothes of cloth of gold.”She stayed that night, for she had good welcome. Next morning when she went out, her husband said: “You’d better go home now to your father.”“I’ll not go to my father if I have to leave you,” said she.So he went on, and she followed. It was that way all the day till night came; and at nightfall they saw another house at the foot of a hill, and again the husband stopped and said: “You go in; I’ll stop outside till morning.”The woman of the house gave her a good welcome. After she had eaten and drunk, a little boy came out of another room, ran to her knee, and said, “Mother.” The woman of the house sent the boy back to where he had come from, and told him to stay there.Next morning, when the princess was going out to her husband, the woman of the house gave her a comb, and said: “If you meet any person with a diseased and a sore head, and draw this comb over it three times, the head will be well, and covered with the most beautiful golden hair ever seen.”She took the comb, and went out to her husband.“Leave me now,” said he, “and go back to your own father.”“I will not,” said she, “but I will follow you while I have the power.” So they went forward that day, as on the other two.At nightfall they came to a third house, at the foot of a hill, where the princess received a good welcome. After she had eaten supper, a little girl with only one eye came to her knee and said, “Mother.”The princess began to cry at sight of the child, thinking that she herself was the cause that it had but one eye. Then she put her hand into her pocket where she kept the handkerchief on which she had dropped the tear when the gray crow carried her infant away. She had never used the handkerchief since that day, for there was an eye on it.She opened the handkerchief, and put the eye in the girl’s head. It grew into the socket that minute, and the child saw out of it as well as out of the other eye; and then the woman of the house sent the little one to bed.Next morning, as the king’s daughter was going out, the woman of the house gave her a whistle, and said: “Whenever you put this whistle to your mouth and blow on it, all the birds of the air will come to you from every quarter under the sun. Be careful of the whistle, as it may serve you greatly.”“Go back to your father’s castle,” said the husband when she came to him, “for I must leave you to-day.”He left her sitting on the mound, went a few steps forward to some bulrushes, pulled up one, and disappeared in the opening where the rush had been.She stopped there, sitting on the mound lamenting, till evening, not knowing what to do. At last she bethought herself, and going to the rushes, pulled up a stalk, went down, followed her husband, and never stopped till she came to the lower land.After a while she reached a small house near a splendid castle. She went into the house and asked, could she stay there till morning. “You can,” said the woman of the house, “and welcome.”Next day the woman of the house was washing clothes, for that was how she made a living. The princess fell to and helped her with the work. In the course of that day the Queen of Tir na n-Og and the husband of the princess were married.Near the castle, and not far from the washerwoman’s, lived a henwife with two ragged little daughters. One of them came around the washerwoman’s house to play. The child looked so poor and her clothes were so torn and dirty that the princess took pity on her, and cut the clothes with the scissors which she had.That moment the most beautiful dress of cloth of gold ever seen on woman or child in that kingdom was on the henwife’s daughter.When she saw what she had on, the child ran home to her mother as fast as ever she could go.“Who gave you that dress?” asked the henwife.“A strange woman that is in that house beyond,” said the little girl, pointing to the washerwoman’s house.The henwife went straight to the Queen of Tir na n-Og and said: “There is a strange woman in the place, who will be likely to take your husband from you, unless you banish her away or do something to her; for she has a pair of scissors different from anything ever seen or heard of in this country.”When the queen heard this she sent word to the princess that, unless the scissors were given up to her without delay, she would have the head off her.The princess said she would give up the scissors if the queen would let her pass one night with her husband.The queen answered that she was willing to give her the one night. The princess came and gave up the scissors, and went to her own husband; but the queen had given him a drink, and he fell asleep, and never woke till after the princess had gone in the morning.Next day another daughter of the henwife went to the washerwoman’s house to play. She was wretched-looking, her head being covered with scabs and sores.The princess drew the comb three times over the child’s head, cured it, and covered it with beautiful golden hair. The little girl ran home and told her mother how the strange woman had drawn the comb over her head, cured it, and given her beautiful golden hair.The henwife hurried off to the queen and said: “That strange woman has a comb with wonderful power to cure, and give golden hair; and she’ll take your husband from you unless you banish her or take her life.”The queen sent word to the princess that unless she gave up the comb, she would have her life.The princess returned as answer that she would give up the comb if she might pass one night with the queen’s husband.The queen was willing, and gave her husband a draught as before. When the princess came, he was fast asleep, and did not waken till after she had gone in the morning.On the third day the washerwoman and the princess went out to walk, and the first daughter of the henwife with them. When they were outside the town, the princess put the whistle to her mouth and blew. That moment the birds of the air flew to her from every direction in flocks. Among them was a bird of song and new tales. The princess went to one side with the bird. “What means can I take,” asked she, “against the queen to get back my husband? Is it best to kill her, and can I do it?”“It is very hard,” said the bird, “to kill her. There is no one in all Tir na n-Og who is able to take her life but her own husband. Inside a holly-tree in front of the castle is a wether, in the wether a duck, in the duck an egg, and in that egg is her heart and life. No man in Tir na n-Og can cut that holly-tree but her husband.”The princess blew the whistle again. A fox and a hawk came to her. She caught and put them into two boxes, which the washerwoman had with her, and took them to her new home.When the henwife’s daughter went home, she told her mother about the whistle. Away ran the henwife to the queen, and said: “That strange woman has a whistle that brings together all the birds of the air, and she’ll have your husband yet, unless you take her head.”“I’ll take the whistle from her, anyhow,” said the queen. So she sent for the whistle.The princess gave answer that she would give up the whistle if she might pass one night with the queen’s husband.The queen agreed, and gave him a draught as on the other nights. He was asleep when the princess came and when she went away.Before going, the princess left a letter with his servant for the queen’s husband, in which she told how she had followed him to Tir na n-Og, and had given the scissors, the comb, and the whistle, to pass three nights in his company, but had not spoken to him because the queen had given him sleeping draughts; that the life of the queen was in an egg, the egg in a duck, the duck in a wether, the wether in a holly-tree in front of the castle, and that no man could split the tree but himself.As soon as he got the letter the husband took an axe, and went to the holly-tree. When he came to the tree he found the princess there before him, having the two boxes with the fox and the hawk in them.He struck the tree a few blows; it split open, and out sprang the wether. He ran scarce twenty perches before the fox caught him. The fox tore him open; then the duck flew out. The duck had not flown fifteen perches when the hawk caught and killed her, smashing the egg. That instant the Queen of Tir na n-Og died.The husband kissed and embraced his faithful wife. He gave a great feast; and when the feast was over, he burned the henwife with her house, built a palace for the washerwoman, and made his servant secretary.They never left Tir na n-Og, and are living there happily now; and so may we live here.","['upon', 'time', 'little', 'girl', 'name', 'elsa', 'live', 'farm', 'pretty', 'sweet-tempered', 'generous', 'like', 'work', 'father', 'proud', 'sent',

1820,irish,Birth of Fin MacCumhail and Origin of the Fenians of Erin,"Cumhal Macart was a great champion in the west of Erin, and it was prophesied of him that if ever he married he would meet death in the next battle he fought.For this reason he had no wife, and knew no woman for a long time; till one day he saw the king’s daughter, who was so beautiful that he forgot all fear and married her in secret.Next day after the marriage, news came that a battle had to be fought.Now a Druid had told the king that his daughter’s son would take the kingdom from him; so he made up his mind to look after the daughter, and not let any man come near her.Before he went to the battle, Cumhal told his mother everything,—told her of his relations with the king’s daughter.He said, “I shall be killed in battle to-day, according to the prophecy of the Druid, and I’m afraid if his daughter has a son the king will kill the child, for the prophecy is that he will lose the kingdom by the son of his own daughter. Now, if the king’s daughter has a son do you hide and rear him, if you can; you will be his only hope and stay.”Cumhal was killed in the battle, and within that year the king’s daughter had a son. By command of his grandfather, the boy was thrown out of the castle window into a loch, to be drowned, on the day of his birth.The boy sank from sight; but after remaining a while under the water, he rose again to the surface, and came to land holding a live salmon in his hand.The grandmother of the boy, Cumhal’s mother, stood watching on the shore, and said to herself as she saw this: “He is my grandson, the true son of my own child,” and seizing the boy, she rushed away with him, and vanished, before the king’s people could stop her.When the king heard that the old woman had escaped with his daughter’s son, he fell into a terrible rage, and ordered all the male children born that day in the kingdom to be put to death, hoping in this way to kill his own grandson, and save the crown for himself.After she had disappeared from the bank of the loch, the old woman, Cumhal’s mother, made her way to a thick forest, where she spent that night as best she could. Next day she came to a great oak tree. Then she hired a man to cut out a chamber in the tree.When all was finished, and there was a nice room in the oak for herself and her grandson, and a whelp of the same age as the boy, and which she had brought with her from the castle, she said to the man: “Give me the axe which you have in your hand, there is something here that I want to fix.”The man gave the axe into her hand, and that minute she swept the head off him, saying: “You’ll never tell any man about this place now.” One day the whelp ate some of the fine chippings (bran) left cut by the carpenter from the inside of the tree. The old woman said: “You’ll be called Bran from this out.”All three lived in the tree together, and the old woman did not take her grandson out till the end of five years; and then he couldn’t walk, he had been sitting so long inside.When the old grandmother had taught the boy to walk, she brought him one day to the brow of a hill from which there was a long slope. She took a switch and said: “Now, run down this place. I will follow and strike you with this switch, and coming up I will run ahead, and you strike me as often as you can.”The first time they ran down, his grandmother struck him many times. In coming up the first time, he did not strike her at all. Every time they ran down she struck him less, and every time they ran up he struck her more.They ran up and down for three days; and at the end of that time she could not strike him once, and he struck her at every step she took. He had now become a great runner.When he was fifteen years of age, the old woman went with him to a hurling match between the forces of his grandfather and those of a neighboring king. Both sides were equal in skill; and neither was able to win, till the youth opposed his grandfather’s people. Then, he won every game. When the ball was thrown in the air, he struck it coming down, and so again and again,—never letting the ball touch the ground till he had driven it through the barrier.“Ah, that is it; Fin will be his name, and Fin MacCumhail he is,” said the old woman.The king ordered his people to seize and put the young man to death, on the spot. The old woman hurried to the side of her grandson. They slipped from the crowd and away they went, a hill at a leap, a glen at a step, and thirty-two miles at a running-leap. They ran a long distance, till Fin grew tired; then the old grandmother took him on her back, putting his feet into two pockets which were in her dress, one on each side, and ran on with the same swiftness as before, a hill at a leap, a glen at a step, and thirty-two miles at a running-leap.After a time, the old woman felt the approach of pursuit, and said to Fin: “Look behind, and tell me what you see.”“I see,” said he, “a white horse with a champion on his back.”“Oh, no fear,” said she; “a white horse has no endurance; he can never catch us, we are safe from him.” And on they sped. A second time she felt the approach of pursuit, and again she said: “Look back, and see who is coming.”Fin looked back, and said: “I see a warrior riding on a brown horse.”“Never fear,” said the old woman; “there is never a brown horse but is giddy, he cannot overtake us.” She rushed on as before. A third time she said: “Look around, and see who is coming now.” Fin looked, and said: “I see a black warrior on a black horse, following fast.”“There is no horse so tough as a black horse,” said the grandmother. “There is no escape from this one. My grandson, one or both of us must die. I am old, my time has nearly come. I will die, and you and Bran save yourselves. (Bran had been with them all the time.) Right here ahead is a deep bog; you jump off my back, and escape as best you can. I’ll jump into the bog up to my neck; and when the king’s men come, I’ll say that you are in the bog before me, sunk out of sight, and I’m trying to find you. As my hair and yours are the same color, they will think my head good enough to carry back. They will cut it off, and take it in place of yours, and show it to the king; that will satisfy his anger.”Fin slipped down, took farewell of his grandmother, and hurried on with Bran. The old woman came to the bog, jumped in, and sank to her neck. The king’s men were soon at the edge of the bog, and the black rider called out to the old woman: “Where is Fin?”“He is here in the bog before me, and I’m trying can I find him.”As the horsemen could not find Fin, and thought the old woman’s head would do to carry back, they cut it off, and took it with them, saying: “This will satisfy the king.”Fin and Bran went on till they came to a great cave, in which they found a herd of goats. At the further end of the cave was a smouldering fire. The two lay down to rest.A couple of hours later, in came a giant with a salmon in his hand. This giant was of awful height, he had but one eye, and that in the middle of his forehead, as large as the sun in heaven.When he saw Fin, he called out: “Here, take this salmon and roast it; but be careful, for if you raise a single blister on it I’ll cut the head off you. I’ve followed this salmon for three days and three nights without stopping, and I never let it out of my sight, for it is the most wonderful salmon in the world.”The giant lay down to sleep in the middle of the cave. Fin spitted the salmon, and held it over the fire.The minute the giant closed the one eye in his head, he began to snore. Every time he drew breath into his body, he dragged Fin, the spit, the salmon, Bran, and all the goats to his mouth; and every time he drove a breath out of himself, he threw them back to the places they were in before. Fin was drawn time after time to the mouth of the giant with such force, that he was in dread of going down his throat.When partly cooked, a blister rose on the salmon. Fin pressed the place with his thumb, to know could he break the blister, and hide from the giant the harm that was done. But he burned his thumb, and, to ease the pain, put it between his teeth, and gnawed the skin to the flesh, the flesh to the bone, the bone to the marrow; and when he had tasted the marrow, he received the knowledge of all things. Next moment, he was drawn by the breath of the giant right up to his face, and, knowing from his thumb what to do, he plunged the hot spit into the sleeping eye of the giant and destroyed it.That instant the giant with a single bound was at the low entrance of the cave, and, standing with his back to the wall and a foot on each side of the opening, roared out: “You’ll not leave this place alive.”Now Fin killed the largest goat, skinned him as quickly as he could, then putting the skin on himself he drove the herd to where the giant stood; the goats passed out one by one between his legs. When the great goat came the giant took him by the horns. Fin slipped from the skin, and ran out.“Oh, you’ve escaped,” said the giant, “but before we part let me make you a present.”“I’m afraid to go near you,” said Fin; “if you wish to give me a present, put it out this way, and then go back.”The giant placed a ring on the ground, then went back. Fin took up the ring and put it on the end of his little finger above the first joint. It clung so firmly that no man in the world could have taken it off.The giant then called out, “Where are you?”“On Fin’s finger,” cried the ring. That instant the giant sprang at Fin and almost came down on his head, thinking in this way to crush him to bits. Fin sprang to a distance. Again the giant asked, “Where are you?”“On Fin’s finger,” answered the ring.Again the giant made a leap, coming down just in front of Fin. Many times he called and many times almost caught Fin, who could not escape with the ring on his finger. While in this terrible struggle, not knowing how to escape, Bran ran up and asked:“Why don’t you chew your thumb?” Fin bit his thumb to the marrow, and then knew what to do. He took the knife with which he had skinned the goat, cut off his finger at the first joint, and threw it, with the ring still on, into a deep bog near by.Again the giant called out, “Where are you?” and the ring answered, “On Fin’s finger.”Straightway the giant sprang towards the voice, sank to his shoulders in the bog, and stayed there.Fin with Bran now went on his way, and travelled till he reached a deep and thick wood, where a thousand horses were drawing timber, and men felling and preparing it.“What is this?” asked Fin of the overseer of the workmen.“Oh, we are building a dun (a castle) for the king; we build one every day, and every night it is burned to the ground. Our king has an only daughter; he will give her to any man who will save the dun, and he’ll leave him the kingdom at his death. If any man undertakes to save the dun and fails, his life must pay for it; the king will cut his head off. The best champions in Erin have tried and failed; they are now in the king’s dungeons, a whole army of them, waiting the king’s pleasure. He’s going to cut the heads off them all in one day.”“Why don’t you chew your thumb?” asked Bran.Fin chewed his thumb to the marrow, and then knew that on the eastern side of the world there lived an old hag with her three sons, and every evening at nightfall she sent the youngest of these to burn the king’s dun.“I will save the king’s dun,” said Fin.“Well,” said the overseer, “better men than you have tried and lost their lives.” “Oh,” said Fin, “I’m not afraid; I’ll try for the sake of the king’s daughter.”Now Fin, followed by Bran, went with the overseer to the king. “I hear you will give your daughter to the man who saves your dun,” said Fin.“I will,” said the king; “but if he fails I must have his head.”“Well,” said Fin, “I’ll risk my head for the sake of your daughter. If I fail I’m satisfied.” The king gave Fin food and drink; he supped, and after supper went to the dun.“Why don’t you chew your thumb?” said Bran; “then you’ll know what to do.” He did. Then Bran took her place on the roof, waiting for the old woman’s son. Now the old woman in the east told her youngest son to hurry on with his torches, burn the dun, and come back without delay; for the stirabout was boiling and he must not be too late for supper.He took the torches, and shot off through the air with a wonderful speed. Soon he was in sight of the king’s dun, threw the torches upon the thatched roof to set it on fire as usual.That moment Bran gave the torches such a push with her shoulders, that they fell into the stream which ran around the dun, and were put out. “Who is this,” cried the youngest son of the old hag, “who has dared to put out my lights, and interfere with my hereditary right?”“I,” said Fin, who stood in front of him. Then began a terrible battle between Fin and the old woman’s son. Bran came down from the dun to help Fin; she bit and tore his enemy’s back, stripping the skin and flesh from his head to his heels.After a terrible struggle such as had not been in the world before that night, Fin cut the head off his enemy. But for Bran, Fin could never have conquered.The time for the return of her son had passed; supper was ready. The old woman, impatient and angry, said to the second son: “You take torches and hurry on, see why your brother loiters. I’ll pay him for this when he comes home! But be careful and don’t do like him, or you’ll have your pay too. Hurry back, for the stirabout is boiling and ready for supper.”He started off, was met and killed exactly as his brother, except that he was stronger and the battle fiercer. But for Bran, Fin would have lost his life that night.The old woman was raging at the delay, and said to her eldest son, who had not been out of the house for years: (It was only in case of the greatest need that she sent him. He had a cat’s head, and was called Pus an Chuine, “Puss of the Corner;” he was the eldest and strongest of all the brothers.) “Now take torches, go and see what delays your brothers; I’ll pay them for this when they come home.”The eldest brother shot off through the air, came to the king’s dun, and threw his torches upon the roof. They had just singed the straw a little, when Bran pushed them off with such force that they fell into the stream and were quenched.“Who is this,” screamed Cat-head, “who dares to interfere with my ancestral right?”“I,” shouted Fin. Then the struggle began fiercer than with the second brother. Bran helped from behind, tearing the flesh from his head to his heels; but at length Cat-head fastened his teeth into Fin’s breast, biting and gnawing till Fin cut the head off. The body fell to the ground, but the head lived, gnawing as terribly as before. Do what they could it was impossible to kill it. Fin hacked and cut, but could neither kill nor pull it off. When nearly exhausted, Bran said:“Why don’t you chew your thumb?”Fin chewed his thumb, and reaching the marrow knew that the old woman in the east was ready to start with torches to find her sons, and burn the dun herself, and that she had a vial of liquid with which she could bring the sons to life; and that nothing could free him from Cat-head but the old woman’s blood.After midnight the old hag, enraged at the delay of her sons, started and shot through the air like lightning, more swiftly than her sons. She threw her torches from afar upon the roof of the dun; but Bran as before hurled them into the stream.Now the old woman circled around in the air looking for her sons. Fin was getting very weak from pain and loss of blood, for Cat-head was biting at his breast all the time.Bran called out: “Rouse yourself, oh, Fin; use all your power or we are lost! If the old hag gets a drop from the vial upon the bodies of her sons, they will come to life, and then we’re done for.”Thus roused, Fin with one spring reached the old woman in the air, and swept the bottle from her grasp; which falling upon the ground was emptied.The old hag gave a scream which was heard all over the world, came to the ground and closed with Fin. Then followed a battle greater than the world had ever known before that night, or has ever seen since. Water sprang out of gray rocks, cows cast their calves even when they had none, and hard rushes grew soft in the remotest corner of Erin, so desperate was the fighting and so awful, between Fin and the old hag. Fin would have died that night but for Bran.Just as daylight was coming Fin swept the head off the old woman, caught some of her blood, and rubbed it around Cat-head, who fell off dead.He rubbed his own wounds with the blood and was cured; then rubbed some on Bran, who had been singed with the torches, and she was as well as ever. Fin, exhausted with fighting, dropped down and fell asleep.While he was sleeping the chief steward of the king came to the dun, found it standing safe and sound, and seeing Fin lying there asleep knew that he had saved it. Bran tried to waken Fin, pulled and tugged, but could not rouse him.The steward went to the king, and said: “I have saved the dun, and I claim the reward.”“It shall be given you,” answered the king; and straightway the steward was recognized as the king’s son-in-law, and orders were given to make ready for the wedding.Bran had listened to what was going on, and when her master woke, exactly at midday, she told him of all that was taking place in the castle of the king.Fin went to the king, and said: “I have saved your dun, and I claim the reward.”“Oh,” said the king, “my steward claimed the reward, and it has been given to him.”“He had nothing to do with saving the dun; I saved it,” said Fin.“Well,” answered the king, “he is the first man who told me of its safety and claimed the reward.” “Bring him here: let me look at him,” said Fin.He was sent for, and came. “Did you save the king’s dun?” asked Fin. “I did,” said the steward.“You did not, and take that for your lies,” said Fin; and striking him with the edge of his open hand he swept the head off his body, dashing it against the other side of the room, flattening it like paste on the wall.“You are the man,” said the king to Fin, “who saved the dun; yours is the reward. All the champions, and there is many a man of them, who have failed to save it are in the dungeons of my fortress; their heads must be cut off before the wedding takes place.”“Will you let me see them?” asked Fin.“I will,” said the king.Fin went down to the men, and found the first champions of Erin in the dungeons. “Will you obey me in all things if I save you from death?” said Fin. “We will,” said they. Then he went back to the king and asked:“Will you give me the lives of these champions of Erin, in place of your daughter’s hand?”“I will,” said the king.All the champions were liberated, and left the king’s castle that day. Ever after they followed the orders of Fin, and these were the beginning of his forces and the first of the Fenians of Erin.","['mbotu', 'famous', 'king', 'town', 'calabar', 'frequently', 'always',

1850,irish,The Thirteenth Son of the King of Erin,"There was a king in Erin long ago who had thirteen sons, and as they grew up he taught them good learning and every exercise and art befitting their rank.One day the king went hunting, and saw a swan swimming in a lake with thirteen little ones. She kept driving away the thirteenth, and would not let it come near the others.The king wondered greatly at this, and when he came home he summoned his Sean dall Glic (old blind sage), and said: “I saw a great wonder to-day while out hunting,—a swan with thirteen cygnets, and she driving away the thirteenth continually, and keeping the twelve with her. Tell me the cause and reason of this. Why should a mother hate her thirteenth little one, and guard the other twelve?”“I will tell you,” said the old blind sage: “all creatures on earth, whether beast or human, which have thirteen young, should put the thirteenth away, and let it wander for itself through the world and find its fate, so that the will of Heaven may work upon it, and not come down on the others. Now you have thirteen sons, and you must give the thirteenth to the Diachbha.”“Then that is the meaning of the swan on the lake,—I must give up my thirteenth son to the Diachbha?”“It is,” said the old blind sage; “you must give up one of your thirteen sons.”“But how can I give one of them away when I am so fond of all; and which one shall it be?”“I’ll tell you what to do. When the thirteen come home to-night, shut the door against the last that comes.”Now one of the sons was slow, not so keen nor so sharp as another; but the eldest, who was called Sean Ruadh, was the best, the hero of them all. And it happened that night that he came home last, and when he came his father shut the door against him. The boy raised his hands and said: “Father, what are you going to do with me; what do you wish?”“It is my duty,” said the father, “to give one of my sons to the Diachbha; and as you are the thirteenth, you must go.”“Well, give me my outfit for the road.”The outfit was brought, Sean Ruadh put it on; then the father gave him a black-haired steed that could overtake the wind before him, and outstrip the wind behind.Sean Ruadh mounted the steed and hurried away. He went on each day without rest, and slept in the woods at night.One morning he put on some old clothes which he had in a pack on the saddle, and leaving his horse in the woods, went aside to an opening. He was not long there when a king rode up and stopped before him.“Who are you, and where are you going?” asked the king. “Oh!” said Sean Ruadh, “I am astray. I do not know where to go, nor what I am to do.”“If that is how you are, I’ll tell you what to do,—come with me.”“Why should I go with you?” asked Sean Ruadh.“Well, I have a great many cows, and I have no one to go with them, no one to mind them. I am in great trouble also. My daughter will die a terrible death very soon.”“How will she die?” asked Sean Ruadh.“There is an urfeist, a great serpent of the sea, a monster which must get a king’s daughter to devour every seven years. Once in seven years this thing comes up out of the sea for its meat. The turn has now come to my daughter, and we don’t know what day will the urfeist appear. The whole castle and all of us are in mourning for my wretched child.”“Perhaps some one will come to save her,” said Sean Ruadh.“Oh! there is a whole army of kings’ sons who have come, and they all promise to save her; but I’m in dread none of them will meet the urfeist.”Sean Ruadh agreed with the king to serve for seven years, and went home with him.Next morning Sean Ruadh drove out the king’s cows to pasture.Now there were three giants not far from the king’s place. They lived in three castles in sight of each other, and every night each of these giants shouted just before going to bed. So loud was the shout that each let out of himself that the people heard it in all the country around.Sean Ruadh drove the cattle up to the giant’s land, pushed down the wall, and let them in. The grass was very high,—three times better than any on the king’s pastures.As Sean Ruadh sat watching the cattle, a giant came running towards him and called out: “I don’t know whether to put a pinch of you in my nose, or a bite of you in my mouth!”“Bad luck to me,” said Sean Ruadh, “if I came here but to take the life out of you!”“How would you like to fight,—on the gray stones, or with sharp swords?” asked the giant.“I’ll fight you,” said Sean Ruadh, “on the gray stones, where your great legs will be going down, and mine standing high.”They faced one another then, and began to fight. At the first encounter Sean Ruadh put the giant down to his knees among the hard gray stones, at the second he put him to his waist, and at the third to his shoulders.“Come, take me out of this,” cried the giant, “and I’ll give you my castle and all I’ve got. I’ll give you my sword of light that never fails to kill at a blow. I’ll give you my black horse that can overtake the wind before, and outstrip the wind behind. These are all up there in my castle.”Sean Ruadh killed the giant and went up to the castle, where the housekeeper said to him: “Oh! it is you that are welcome. You have killed the dirty giant that was here. Come with me now till I show you all the riches and treasures.”She opened the door of the giant’s store-room and said: “All these are yours. Here are the keys of the castle.”“Keep them till I come again, and wake me in the evening,” said Sean Ruadh, lying down on the giant’s bed.He slept till evening; then the housekeeper roused him, and he drove the king’s cattle home. The cows never gave so much milk as that night. They gave as much as in a whole week before.Sean Ruadh met the king, and asked: “What news from your daughter?”“The great serpent did not come to-day,” said the king; “but he may come to-morrow.”“Well, to-morrow he may not come till another day,” said Sean Ruadh.Now the king knew nothing of the strength of Sean Ruadh, who was bare-footed, ragged, and shabby.The second morning Sean Ruadh put the king’s cows in the second giant’s land. Out came the second giant with the same questions and threats as the first, and the cowboy spoke as on the day before.They fell to fighting; and when the giant was to his shoulders in the hard gray rocks, he said: “I’ll give you my sword of light and my brown-haired horse if you’ll spare my life.”“Where is your sword of light?” asked Sean Ruadh.“It is hung up over my bed.”Sean Ruadh ran to the giant’s castle, and took the sword, which screamed out when he seized it; but he held it fast, hurried back to the giant, and asked, “How shall I try the edge of this sword?”“Against a stick,” was the reply.“I see no stick better than your own head,” said Sean Ruadh; and with that he swept the head off the giant.The cowboy now went back to the castle and hung up the sword. “Blessing to you,” said the housekeeper; “you have killed the giant! Come, now, and I’ll show you his riches and treasures, which are yours forever.”Sean Ruadh found more treasure in this castle than in the first one. When he had seen all, he gave the keys to the housekeeper till he should need them. He slept as on the day before, then drove the cows home in the evening.The king said: “I have the luck since you came to me. My cows give three times as much milk to-day as they did yesterday.”“Well,” said Sean Ruadh, “have you any account of the urfeist?”“He didn’t come to-day,” said the king; “but he may come to-morrow.”Sean Ruadh went out with the king’s cows on the third day, and drove them to the third giant’s land, who came out and fought a more desperate battle than either of the other two; but the cowboy pushed him down among the gray rocks to his shoulders and killed him.At the castle of the third giant he was received with gladness by the housekeeper, who showed him the treasures and gave him the keys; but he left the keys with her till he should need them. That evening the king’s cows had more milk than ever before.On the fourth day Sean Ruadh went out with the cows, but stopped at the first giant’s castle. The housekeeper at his command brought out the dress of the giant, which was all black. He put on the giant’s apparel, black as night, and girded on his sword of light. Then he mounted the black-haired steed, which overtook the wind before, and outstripped the wind behind; and rushing on between earth and sky, he never stopped till he came to the beach, where he saw hundreds upon hundreds of kings’ sons, and champions, who were anxious to save the king’s daughter, but were so frightened at the terrible urfeist that they would not go near her.When he had seen the princess and the trembling champions, Sean Ruadh turned his black steed to the castle. Presently the king saw, riding between earth and sky, a splendid stranger, who stopped before him.“What is that I see on the shore?” asked the stranger. “Is it a fair, or some great meeting?”“Haven’t you heard,” asked the king, “that a monster is coming to destroy my daughter to-day?”“No, I haven’t heard anything,” answered the stranger, who turned away and disappeared.Soon the black horseman was before the princess, who was sitting alone on a rock near the sea. As she looked at the stranger, she thought he was the finest man on earth, and her heart was cheered.“Have you no one to save you?” he asked.“Will you let me lay my head on your lap till the urfeist comes? Then rouse me.”He put his head on her lap and fell asleep. While he slept, the princess took three hairs from his head and hid them in her bosom. As soon as she had hidden the hairs, she saw the urfeist coming on the sea, great as an island, and throwing up water to the sky as he moved. She roused the stranger, who sprang up to defend her.The urfeist came upon shore, and was advancing on the princess with mouth open and wide as a bridge, when the stranger stood before him and said: “This woman is mine, not yours!”Then drawing his sword of light, he swept off the monster’s head with a blow; but the head rushed back to its place, and grew on again.In a twinkle the urfeist turned and went back to the sea; but as he went, he said: “I’ll be here again to-morrow, and swallow the whole world before me as I come.”“Well,” answered the stranger, “maybe another will come to meet you.”Sean Ruadh mounted his black steed, and was gone before the princess could stop him. Sad was her heart when she saw him rush off between the earth and sky more swiftly than any wind.Sean Ruadh went to the first giant’s castle and put away his horse, clothes, and sword. Then he slept on the giant’s bed till evening, when the housekeeper woke him, and he drove home the cows. Meeting the king, he asked: “Well, how has your daughter fared to-day?”“Oh! the urfeist came out of the sea to carry her away; but a wonderful black champion came riding between earth and sky and saved her.”“Who was he?”“Oh! there is many a man who says he did it. But my daughter isn’t saved yet, for the urfeist said he’d come to-morrow.”“Well, never fear; perhaps another champion will come to-morrow.”Next morning Sean Ruadh drove the king’s cows to the land of the second giant, where he left them feeding, and then went to the castle, where the housekeeper met him and said: “You are welcome. I’m here before you, and all is well.” “Let the brown horse be brought; let the giant’s apparel and sword be ready for me,” said Sean Ruadh.The apparel was brought, the beautiful blue dress of the second giant, and his sword of light. Sean Ruadh put on the apparel, took the sword, mounted the brown steed, and sped away between earth and air three times more swiftly than the day before.He rode first to the seashore, saw the king’s daughter sitting on the rock alone, and the princes and champions far away, trembling in dread of the urfeist. Then he rode to the king, enquired about the crowd on the seashore, and received the same answer as before. “But is there no man to save her?” asked Sean Ruadh.“Oh! there are men enough,” said the king, “who promise to save her, and say they are brave; but there is no man of them who will stand to his word and face the urfeist when he rises from the sea.”Sean Ruadh was away before the king knew it, and rode to the princess in his suit of blue, bearing his sword of light. “Is there no one to save you?” asked he.“Let me lay my head on your lap, and when the urfeist comes, rouse me.”He put his head on her lap, and while he slept she took out the three hairs, compared them with his hair, and said to herself: “You are the man who was here yesterday.”When the urfeist appeared, coming over the sea, the princess roused the stranger, who sprang up and hurried to the beach.The monster, moving at a greater speed, and raising more water than on the day before, came with open mouth to land. Again Sean Ruadh stood in his way, and with one blow of the giant’s sword made two halves of the urfeist. But the two halves rushed together, and were one as before.Then the urfeist turned to the sea again, and said as he went: “All the champions on earth won’t save her from me to-morrow!”Sean Ruadh sprang to his steed and back to the castle. He went, leaving the princess in despair at his going. She tore her hair and wept for the loss of the blue champion,—the one man who had dared to save her.Sean Ruadh put on his old clothes, and drove home the cows as usual. The king said: “A strange champion, all dressed in blue, saved my daughter to-day; but she is grieving her life away because he is gone.”“Well, that is a small matter, since her life is safe,” said Sean Ruadh.There was a feast for the whole world that night at the king’s castle, and gladness was on every face that the king’s daughter was safe again.Next day Sean Ruadh drove the cows to the third giant’s pasture, went to the castle, and told the housekeeper to bring the giant’s sword and apparel, and have the red steed led to the door. The third giant’s dress had as many colors as there are in the sky, and his boots were of blue glass.Sean Ruadh, dressed and mounted on his red steed, was the most beautiful man in the world. When ready to start, the housekeeper said to him: “The beast will be so enraged this time that no arms can stop him; he will rise from the sea with three great swords coming out of his mouth, and he could cut to pieces and swallow the whole world if it stood before him in battle. There is only one way to conquer the urfeist, and I will show it to you. Take this brown apple, put it in your bosom, and when he comes rushing from the sea with open mouth, do you throw the apple down his throat, and the great urfeist will melt away and die on the strand.”Sean Ruadh went on the red steed between earth and sky, with thrice the speed of the day before. He saw the maiden sitting on the rock alone, saw the trembling kings’ sons in the distance watching to know what would happen, and saw the king hoping for some one to save his daughter; then he went to the princess, and put his head on her lap; when he had fallen asleep, she took the three hairs from her bosom, and looking at them, said: “You are the man who saved me yesterday.”The urfeist was not long in coming. The princess roused Sean Ruadh, who sprang to his feet and went to the sea. The urfeist came up enormous, terrible to look at, with a mouth big enough to swallow the world, and three sharp swords coming out of it. When he saw Sean Ruadh, he sprang at him with a roar; but Sean Ruadh threw the apple into his mouth, and the beast fell helpless on the strand, flattened out and melted away to a dirty jelly on the shore.Then Sean Ruadh went towards the princess and said: “That urfeist will never trouble man or woman again.”The princess ran and tried to cling to him; but he was on the red steed, rushing away between earth and sky, before she could stop him. She held, however, so firmly to one of the blue glass boots that Sean Ruadh had to leave it in her hands.When he drove home the cows that night, the king came out, and Sean Ruadh asked: “What news from the urfeist?”“Oh!” said the king, “I’ve had the luck since you came to me. A champion wearing all the colors of the sky, and riding a red steed between earth and air, destroyed the urfeist to-day. My daughter is safe forever; but she is ready to kill herself because she hasn’t the man that saved her.”That night there was a feast in the king’s castle such as no one had ever seen before. The halls were filled with princes and champions, and each one said: “I am the man that saved the princess!”The king sent for the old blind sage, and asked, what should he do to find the man who saved his daughter. The old blind sage said,—“Send out word to all the world that the man whose foot the blue glass boot will fit is the champion who killed the urfeist, and you’ll give him your daughter in marriage.”The king sent out word to the world to come to try on the boot. It was too large for some, too small for others. When all had failed, the old sage said,—“All have tried the boot but the cowboy.”“Oh! he is always out with the cows; what use in his trying,” said the king.“No matter,” answered the old blind sage; “let twenty men go and bring down the cowboy.”The king sent up twenty men, who found the cowboy sleeping in the shadow of a stone wall. They began to make a hay rope to bind him; but he woke up, and had twenty ropes ready before they had one. Then he jumped at them, tied the twenty in a bundle, and fastened the bundle to the wall. They waited and waited at the castle for the twenty men and the cowboy, till at last the king sent twenty men more, with swords, to know what was the delay.When they came, this twenty began to make a hay rope to tie the cowboy; but he had twenty ropes made before their one, and no matter how they fought, the cowboy tied the twenty in a bundle, and the bundle to the other twenty men.When neither party came back, the old blind sage said to the king: “Go up now, and throw yourself down before the cowboy, for he has tied the forty men in two bundles, and the bundles to each other.”The king went and threw himself down before the cowboy, who raised him up and said: “What is this for?”“Come down now and try on the glass boot,” said the king.“How can I go, when I have work to do here?”“Oh! never mind; you’ll come back soon enough to do the work.”The cowboy untied the forty men and went down with the king. When he stood in front of the castle, he saw the princess sitting in her upper chamber, and the glass boot on the window-sill before her.That moment the boot sprang from the window through the air to him, and went on his foot of itself. The princess was downstairs in a twinkle, and in the arms of Sean Ruadh.The whole place was crowded with kings’ sons and champions, who claimed that they had saved the princess.“What are these men here for?” asked Sean Ruadh. “Oh! they have been trying to put on the boot,” said the king.With that Sean Ruadh drew his sword of light, swept the heads off every man of them, and threw heads and bodies on the dirt-heap behind the castle.Then the king sent ships with messengers to all the kings and queens of the world,—to the kings of Spain, France, Greece, and Lochlin, and to Diarmuid, son of the monarch of light,—to come to the wedding of his daughter and Sean Ruadh.Sean Ruadh, after the wedding, went with his wife to live in the kingdom of the giants, and left his father-in-law on his own land.","['soon', 'manhood', 'attain', 'young', 'indian', 'must', 'secure', 'charm', 'medicine', 'sweat-bath', 'retires', 'lonely', 'spot', 'four', 'night', 'necessary', 'remains', 'solitude',

1996,irish,The Huntman's Son,"A long, long time ago there lived in a little hut, on the borders of a great forest, a huntsman and his wife and son. From his earliest years the boy, whose name was Fergus, used to hunt with his father in the forest, and he grew up strong and active, sure and swift-footed as a deer, and as free and fearless as the wind. He was tall and handsome; as supple as a mountain ash, his lips were as red as its berries; his eyes were as blue as the skies in spring; and his hair fell down over his shoulders like a shower of gold. His heart was as light as a bird’s, and no bird was fonder of green woods and waving branches. He had lived since his birth in the hut in the forest, and had never wished to leave it, until one winter night a wandering minstrel sought shelter there, and paid for his night’s lodging with songs of love and battle. Ever since that night Fergus pined for another life. He no longer found joy in the music of the hounds or in the cries of the huntsmen in forest glades. He yearned for the chance of battle, and the clang of shields, and the fierce shouts of fighting warriors, and he spent all his spare hours practising on the harp and learning the use of arms, for in those days the bravest warriors were also bards.In this way the spring and summer and autumn passed; and when the winter came again it chanced that on a stormy night, when thunder was rattling through the forest, smiting the huge oaks and hurling them crashing to the earth, Fergus lay awake thinking of his present lot, and wondering what the future might have in store for him. The lightning was playing around the hut, and every now and then a flash brightened up the interior.After a peal, louder than any which had preceded it, Fergus heard three loud knocks at the door. He called out to his parents that some one was knocking.“If that is so,” said his father, “open at once; this is no night to keep a poor wanderer outside our door.”Fergus did as he was bidden, and as he opened the door a flash of lightning showed him, standing at the threshold, a little wizened old man with a small harp under his arm.“Come in, and welcome,” said Fergus, and the little man stepped into the room.“It is a wild night, neighbours,” said he.“It is, indeed, a wild night,” said the huntsman and his wife, who had got up and dressed themselves; “and sorry we are we have no better shelter or better fare to offer you, but we give you the best we have.”“A king cannot do more than his best,” said the little man.The huntsman’s wife lit the fire, and soon the pine logs flashed up into a blaze, and made the hut bright and warm. She then brought forth a peggin of milk and a cake of barley-bread.“You must be hungry, sir,” she said.“Hungry I am,” said he; “but I wouldn’t ask for better fare than this if I were in the king’s palace.”“Thank you kindly, sir,” said she, “and I hope you will eat enough, and that it will do you good.”“And while you are eating your supper,” said the huntsman, “I’ll make you a bed of fresh rushes.”“Don’t put yourself to that trouble,” said the little man. “When I have done my supper I’ll lie down here by the fire, if it is pleasing to you, and I’ll sleep like a top until morning. And now go back to your beds and leave me to myself, and maybe some time when you won’t be expecting it I’ll do a good turn for your kindness to the poor wayfarer.”“Oh, it’s no kindness at all,” said the huntsman’s wife. “It would be a queer thing if an Irish cabin would not give shelter and welcome in a wild night like this. So good night, now, and we hope you will sleep well.”“Good night,” said the little man, “and may you and yours never sup sorrow until your dying day.”The huntsman and his wife and Fergus then went back to their beds, and the little man, having finished his supper, curled himself up by the fire, and was soon fast asleep.About an hour after a loud clap of thunder awakened Fergus, and before it had died away he heard three knocks at the door. He aroused his parents and told them.“Get up at once,” said his mother, “this is no night to keep a stranger outside our door.”Fergus rose and opened the door, and a flash of lightning showed him a little old woman, with a shuttle in her hand, standing outside.“Come in, and welcome,” said he, and the little old woman stepped into the room.“Blessings be on them who give welcome to a wanderer on a wild night like this,” said the old woman.“And who wouldn’t give welcome on a night like this?” said the huntsman’s wife, coming forward with a peggin of milk and a barley cake in her hand, “and sorry we are we have not better fare to offer you.”“Enough is as good as a feast,” said the little woman, “and now go back to your beds and leave me to myself.”“Not till I shake down a bed of rushes for you,” said the huntsman’s wife.“Don’t mind the rushes,” said the little woman; “go back to your beds. I’ll sleep here by the fire.”The huntsman’s wife went to bed, and the little old woman, having eaten her supper, lay down by the fire, and was soon fast asleep.About an hour later another clap of thunder startled Fergus. Again he heard three knocks at the door. He roused his parents, but he did not wait for orders from them. He opened the door, and a flash of lightning showed him outside the threshold a low-sized, shaggy, wild-looking horse. And Fergus knew it was the Pooka, the wild horse of the mountains. Bold as Fergus was, his heart beat quickly as he saw fire issuing from the Pooka’s nostrils. But, banishing fear, he cried out:“Come in, and welcome.”“Welcome you are,” said the huntsman, “and sorry we are that we have not better shelter or fare to offer you.”“I couldn’t wish a better welcome,” said the Pooka, as he came over near the fire and sat down on his haunches.“Maybe you would like a little bit of this, Master Pooka,” said the huntsman’s wife, as she offered him a barley cake.“I never tasted anything sweeter in my life,” said the Pooka, crunching it between his teeth, “and now if you can give me a sup of milk, I’ll want for nothing.”The huntsman’s wife brought him a peggin of milk. When he had drunk it, “Now,” says the Pooka, “go back to your beds, and I’ll curl myself up by the fire and sleep like a top till morning.”And soon everybody in the hut was fast asleep.When the morning came the storm had gone, and the sun was shining through the windows of the hut. At the song of the lark Fergus got up, and no one in the world was ever more surprised than he when he saw no sign of the little old man, or the little old woman, or the wild horse of the mountains. His parents were also surprised, and they all thought that they must have been dreaming until they saw the empty peggins around the fire and some pieces of broken bread; and they did not know what to think of it all.From that day forward the desire grew stronger in the heart of Fergus for a change of life; and one day he told his parents that he was resolved to seek his fortune. He said he wished to be a soldier, and that he would set out for the king’s palace, and try to join the ranks of the Feni.About a week afterwards he took leave of his parents, and having received their blessing he struck out for the road that led to the palace of the High King of Erin. He arrived there just at the time when the great captain of the Fenian host was recruiting his battalions, which had been thinned in recent battle.The manly figure of Fergus, his gallant bearing, and handsome face, all told in his favour. But before he could be received into the Fenian ranks he had to prove that he could play the harp like a bard, that he could contend with staff and shield against nine Fenian warriors, that he could run with plaited hair through the tangled forest without loosening a single hair, and that in his course he could jump over trees as high as his head, and stoop under trees as low as his knee, and that he could run so lightly that the rotten twigs should not break under his feet. Fergus proved equal to all the tests, thanks to the wandering minstrel who taught him the use of the harp, to his own brave heart, and to his forest training. He was enrolled in the second battalion of the Feni, and before long he was its bravest and ablest champion.At that very time it happened that the niece of the High King of Erin was staying with the king and queen in their palace at Tara. The princess was the loveliest lady in all the land. She was as proud as she was beautiful. The princes and chieftains of Erin in vain sought her hand in marriage. From Alba and Spain, and the far-off isles of Greece, kings came to woo her. From the northern lands came vikings in stately galleys with brazen prows, whose oarsmen tore the white foam from the emerald seas as they swept towards the Irish coasts. But the lady had vowed she would wed with no one except a battle champion who could excel in music the chief bard of the High King of Erin; who could outstrip on his steed in the great race of Tara the white steed of the plains; and who could give her as a wedding robe a garment of all the colours of the rainbow, so finely spun that when folded up it would fit in the palm of her small white hand. To fulfil these three conditions was impossible for all her suitors, and it seemed as if the loveliest lady of the land should go unmarried to her grave.It chanced that once, on a day when the Fenian battalions were engaged in a hurling-match, Fergus beheld the lady watching the match from her sunny bower. He no sooner saw her than he fell over head and ears in love with her, and he thought of her by night, and he thought of her by day, and believing that his love was hopeless, he often wished he had never left his forest-home.The great fair of Tara was coming on, and all the Feni were busy from morning till night practising feats of arms and games, in order to take part in the contests to be held during the fair. And Fergus, knowing that the princess would be present, determined to do his best to win the prizes which were to be contended for before the ladies’ eyes.The fair began on the 1st of August, but for a whole week before the five great roads of Erin were thronged with people of all sorts. Princes and warriors on their steeds, battle champions in their chariots, harpers in hundreds, smiths with gleaming spears and shields and harness for battle steeds and chariots; troops of men and boys leading racehorses; jewellers with gold drinking-horns, and brooches, and pins, and ear-rings, and costly gems of all kinds, and chess-boards of silver and gold, and golden and silver chessmen in bags of woven brass; dyers with their many-coloured fabrics; bands of jugglers; drovers goading on herds of cattle; shepherds driving their sheep; huntsmen with spoils of the chase; dwellers in the lakes or by the fish-abounding rivers with salmon and speckled trout; and countless numbers of peasants on horseback and on foot, all wending their way to the great meeting-place by the mound, which a thousand years before had been raised over the grave of the great queen. For there the fair was to be held.On the opening day the High King, attended by the four kings of Erin, set out from the palace, and with them went the queen and the ladies of the court in sparkling chariots. The princess rode in the chariot with the high queen, under an awning made of the wings of birds, to protect them from the rays of the sun. Following the queen were the court ladies in other chariots, under awnings of purple or of yellow silk. Then came the brehons, the great judges of the land, and the chief bards of the high court of Tara, and the Druids, crowned with oak leaves, and carrying wands of divination in their hands.When the royal party reached the ground it took its place in enclosures right up against the monumental mound. The High King sat with the four kings of Erin, all wearing their golden helmets, for they wore their diadems in battle only. In an enclosure next the king’s sat the queen and the princess and all the ladies of the court. At either side of the royal pavilions were others for the dames and ladies and nobles and chiefs of different degrees, forming part of a circle on the plain, and the stands and benches for the people were so arranged as to complete the circle, and in the round green space within it, so that all might hear and see, the contests were to take place.At a signal from the king, who was greeted with a thunderous cheer, the heralds rode round the circle, and having struck their sounding shields three times with their swords, they made a solemn proclamation of peace. Then was sung by all the assembled bards, to the accompaniment of their harps, the chant in honour of the mighty dead. When this was ended, again the heralds struck their shields, and the contests began. The first contest was the contest of spear-throwing between the champions of the seven battalions of the Feni. When the seven champions took their places in front of the royal enclosure, everyone, even the proud princess, was struck by the manly beauty and noble bearing of Fergus.The champions poised their spears, and at a stroke from the heralds upon their shields the seven spears sped flashing through the air. They all struck the ground, shafts up, and it was seen that two were standing side by side in advance of the rest, one belonged to Fergus, the other to the great chief, Oscar. The contest for the prize then lay between Oscar and Fergus, and when they stood in front of the king, holding their spears aloft, every heart was throbbing with excitement. Once more the heralds struck their shields, and, swifter than the lightning’s flash, forth went the spears, and when Fergus’s spear was seen shivering in the ground a full length ahead of the great chief Oscar’s, the air was shaken by a wild cheer that was heard far beyond the plains of Tara. And as Fergus approached the high king to receive the prize the cheers were renewed. But Fergus thought more of the winsome glance of the princess than he did of the prize or the sounding cheers. And Princess Maureen was almost sorry for her vow, for her heart was touched by the beauty of the Fenian champion.Other contests followed, and the day passed, and the night fell, and while the Fenian warriors were revelling in their camps the heart of Fergus, victor as he was, was sad and low. He escaped from his companions, and stole away to his native forest, for––“When the heart is sick and sorest,There is balsam in the forest––There is balsam in the forestFor its pain.”And as he lay under the spreading branches, watching the stars glancing through the leaves, and listening to the slumb’rous murmur of the waters, a strange peace came over him.But in the camp which he had left, and in the vast multitude on the plains of Tara, there was stir and revelry, and babbling speculation as to the contest of to-morrow––the contest which was to decide whether the chief bard of Erin was to hold his own against all comers, or yield the palm. For rumour said that a great Skald had come from the northern lands to compete with the Irish bard.At last, over the Fenian camp, and over the great plain and the multitude that thronged it, sleep fell, clothing them with a silence as deep as that which dwelt in the forest, where, dreaming of the princess, Fergus lay. He awoke at the first notes of the birds, but though he felt he ought to go back to his companions and be witness of the contest which might determine whether the princess was to be another’s bride, his great love and his utter despair of winning her so oppressed him that he lay as motionless as a broken reed. He scarcely heard the music of the birds, and paid no heed to the murmur of the brook rushing by his feet. The crackling of branches near him barely disturbed him, but when a shadow fell across his eyes he looked up gloomily, and saw, or thought he saw, someone standing before him. He started up, and who should he see but the little wizened old man who found shelter in his father’s hut on the stormy night.“This is a nice place for a battle champion to be. This is a nice place for you to be on the day which is to decide who will be the successful suitor of the princess.”“What is it to me,” said Fergus, “who is to win her since I cannot.”“I told you,” said the little man, “the night you opened the door for me, that the time might come when I might be able to do a good turn for you and yours. The time has come. Take this harp, and my luck go with you, and in the contest of the bards to-day you’ll reap the reward of the kindness you did when you opened your door to the poor old wayfarer in the midnight storm.”The little man handed his harp to Fergus and disappeared as swiftly as the wind that passes through the leaves.Fergus, concealing the harp under his silken cloak, reached the camp before his comrades had aroused themselves from sleep.At length the hour arrived when the great contest was to take place.The king gave the signal, and as the chief bard of Erin was seen ascending the mound in front of the royal enclosures he was greeted with a roar of cheers, but at the first note of his harp silence like that of night fell on the mighty gathering.As he moved his fingers softly over the strings every heart was hushed, filled with a sense of balmy rest. The lark soaring and singing above his head paused mute and motionless in the still air, and no sound was heard over the spacious plain save the dreamy music. Then the bard struck another key, and a gentle sorrow possessed the hearts of his hearers, and unbidden tears gathered to their eyes. Then, with bolder hand, he swept his fingers across his lyre, and all hearts were moved to joy and pleasant laughter, and eyes that had been dimmed by tears sparkled as brightly as running waters dancing in the sun. When the last notes had died away a cheer arose, loud as the voice of the storm in the glen when the live thunder is revelling on the mountain tops. As soon as the bard had descended the mound the Skald from the northern lands took his place, greeted by cries of welcome from a hundred thousand throats. He touched his harp, and in the perfect silence was heard the strains of the mermaid’s song, and through it the pleasant ripple of summer waters on the pebbly beach. Then the theme was changed, and on the air was borne the measured sweep of countless oars and the swish of waters around the prows of contending galleys, and the breezy voices of the sailors and the sea-bird’s cry. Then his theme was changed to the mirth and laughter of the banquet-hall, the clang of meeting drinking-horns, and songs of battle. When the last strain ended, from the mighty host a great shout went up, loud as the roar of winter billows breaking in the hollows of the shore; and men knew not whom to declare the victor, the chief bard of Erin or the Skald of the northern lands.In the height of the debate the cry arose that another competitor had ascended the mound, and there standing in view of all was Fergus, the huntsman’s son. All eyes were fastened upon him, but no one looked so eagerly as the princess.He touched his harp with gentle fingers, and a sound low and soft as a faint summer breeze passing through forest trees stole out, and then was heard the rustle of birds through the branches, and the dreamy murmur of waters lost in deepest woods, and all the fairy echoes whispering when the leaves are motionless in the noonday heat; then followed notes cool and soft as the drip of summer showers on the parched grass, and then the song of the blackbird, sounding as clearly as it sounds in long silent spaces of the evening, and then in one sweet jocund burst the multitudinous voices that hail the breaking of the morn. And the lark, singing and soaring above the minstrel, sank mute and motionless upon his shoulder, and from all the leafy woods the birds came thronging out and formed a fluttering canopy above his head.When the bard ceased playing no shout arose from the mighty multitude, for the strains of his harp, long after its chords were stilled, held their hearts spell-bound.And when he had passed away from the mound of contest all knew there was no need to declare the victor. And all were glad the comely Fenian champion had maintained the supremacy of the bards of Erin. But there was one heart sad, the heart of the princess; and now she wished more than ever that she had never made her hateful vow.Other contests went on, but Fergus took no interest in them; and once more he stole away to the forest glade. His heart was sorrowful, for he thought of the great race of the morning, and he knew that he could not hope to compete with the rider of the white steed of the plains. And as he lay beneath the spreading branches during the whole night long his thoughts were not of the victory he had won, but of the princess, who was as far away from him as ever. He passed the night without sleep, and when the morning came he rose and walked aimlessly through the woods.A deer starting from a thicket reminded him of the happy days of his boyhood, and once more the wish came back to him that he had never left his forest home. As his eyes followed the deer wistfully, suddenly he started in amazement. The deer vanished from view, and in his stead was the wild horse of the mountains.“I told you I’d do you a good turn,” said the Pooka, “for the kindness you and yours did me on that wild winter’s night. The day is passing. You have no time to lose. The white steed of the plains is coming to the starting-post. Jump on my back, and remember, ‘Faint heart never won fair lady.’”In half a second Fergus was bestride the Pooka, whose coat of shaggy hair became at once as glossy as silk, and just at the very moment when the king was about to declare there was no steed to compete with the white steed of the plains, the Pooka with Fergus upon his back, galloped up in front of the royal enclosure. When the people saw the champion a thunderous shout rose up that startled the birds in the skies, and sent them flying to the groves.And in the ladies’ enclosure was a rustle of many-coloured scarves waving in the air. At the striking of the shields the contending steeds rushed from the post with the swiftness of a swallow’s flight. But before the white steed of the plains had gone half-way round, Fergus and the wild horse of the mountains had passed the winning post, greeted by such cheers as had never before been heard on the plains of Tara.Fergus heard the cheers, but scarcely heeded them, for his heart went out through his eyes that were fastened on the princess, and a wild hope stirred him that his glance was not ungrateful to the loveliest lady of the land.And the princess was sad and sorry for her vow, for she believed that it was beyond the power of Fergus to bring her a robe of all the colours of the rainbow, so subtly woven as to fit in the palm of her soft, white hand.That night also Fergus went to the forest, not too sad, because there was a vague hope in his heart that had never been there before. He lay down under the branches, with his feet towards the rustling waters, and the smiles of the princess gilded his slumbers, as the rays of the rising sun gild the glades of the forest; and when the morning came he was scarcely surprised when before him appeared the little old woman with the shuttle he had welcomed on the winter’s night.“You think you have won her already,” said the little woman. “And so you have, too; her heart is all your own, and I’m half inclined to think that my trouble will be thrown away, for if you had never a wedding robe to give her, she’d rather have you this minute than all the kings of Erin, or than all the other princes and kings and chieftains in the whole world. But you and your father and mother were kind to me on a wild winter’s night, and I’d never see your mother’s son without a wedding robe fit for the greatest princess that ever set nations to battle for her beauty. So go and pluck me a handful of wild forest flowers, and I’ll weave out of them a wedding robe with all the colours of the rainbow, and one that will be as sweet and as fragrant as the ripe, red lips of the princess herself.”Fergus, with joyous heart, culled the flowers, and brought them to the little old woman.In the twinkling of an eye she wove with her little shuttle a wedding robe, with all the colours of the rainbow, as light as the fairy dew, as soft as the hand of the princess, as fragrant as her little red mouth, and so small that it would pass through the eye of a needle.“Go now, Fergus,” said she, “and may luck go with you; but, in the days of your greatness and of the glory which will come to you when you are wedded to the princess, be as kind, and have as open a heart and as open a door for the poor as you had when you were only a poor huntsman’s son.”Fergus took the robe and went towards Tara. It was the last day of the fair, and all the contests were over, and the bards were about to chant the farewell strains to the memory of the great queen. But before the chief bard could ascend the mound, Fergus, attended by a troop of Fenian warriors on their steeds, galloped into the enclosure, and rode up in front of the queen’s pavilion. Holding up the glancing and many-coloured robe, he said:“O Queen and King of Erin! I claim the princess for my bride. You, O king, have decided that I have won the prize in the contest of the bards; that I have won the prize in the race against the white steed of the plains; it is for the princess to say if the robe which I give her will fit in the hollow of her small white hand.”“Yes,” said the king. “You are victor in the contests; let the princess declare if you have fulfilled the last condition.”The princess took the robe from Fergus, closed her fingers over it, so that no vestige of it was seen.“Yes, O king!” said she, “he has fulfilled the last condition; but before ever he had fulfilled a single one of them, my heart went out to the comely champion of the Feni. I was willing then, I am ready now, to become the bride of the huntsman’s son.”","['young', 'three', 'child', 'brought', 'tortoise', 'spruit', 'behind', 'house', 'half-indignant', 'half-amused',

2038,irish,Billy Duff and the Devil,"Billy Duffy was an Irishman, a blacksmith, and a drunkard. He had the Keltic aversion from steady work, and stuck to his forge only long enough to get money for drink; when that was spent, he returned to work.Billy was coming home one day after one of these drinking-bouts, soberer than usual, when he exclaimed to himself, for the thirst was upon him, “By God! I would sell myself to the devil if I could get some more drink.”At that moment a tall gentleman in black stepped up to him, and said, “What did you say?”“I said I would sell myself to the devil if I could get a drink.”“Well, how much do you want for seven years, and the devil to get you then?”“Well, I can’t tell exactly, when it comes to the push.”“Will £700 do you?”“Yes; I’d take £700.”“And the devil to get you then?”“Oh, yes; I don’t care about that.”When Billy got home he found the money in his smithy. He at once shut the smithy, and began squandering the money, keeping open house.Amongst the people who flocked to get what they could out of Billy came an old hermit, who said, “I am very hungry, and nearly starved. Will you give me something to eat and drink?”“Oh, yes; come in and get what you like.”The hermit disappeared, after eating and drinking, and did not reappear for several months, when he received the same kindly welcome, again disappearing. A few months afterwards he again appeared.“Come in, come in!” said Billy.After he had eaten and drunk his full, the hermit said to Billy: “Well, three times have you been good and kind to me. I’ll give you three wishes, and whatever you wish will be sure to come true.”“I must have time to consider,” said Billy.“Oh, you shall have plenty of time to consider, and mind they are good wishes.”Next morning Billy told the hermit he was ready. “Well, go on; be sure they’re good wishes,” said the hermit.“Well, I’ve got a big sledge-hammer in the smithy, and I wish whoever gets hold of that hammer shall go on striking the anvil, and never break it, till I tell him to stop.”“Oh, that’s a bad wish, Billy.”“Oh, no; you’ll see it’s good. Next thing I wish for is a purse so that no one can take out whatever I put into it.”“Oh, Billy, Billy! that’s a bad wish. Be careful now about the third wish,” said the hermit.“Well, I have got an armchair upstairs, and I wish that whoever may sit in that armchair will never be able to get up till I let them.”“Well, well, indeed; they are not very good wishes.”“Oh, yes; I’ve got my senses about me. I think I’ll make them good wishes, after all.”The seven years, all but three days, had passed, and Billy was back working at his forge, for all his money was gone, when the dark gentleman stepped in and said:“Now, Billy, during these last three days you may have as much money as you like,” and he disappeared.On the last day of his seven years Billy was penniless, and he went to the taproom of his favourite inn, which was full.“Well, boys,” said Billy, “we must have some money to-night. I’ll treat you, and give you a pound each,” and rising, he placed his tumbler in the middle of the table, and wished for twenty pounds. No sooner had he wished than a ball of fire came through the ceiling, and the twenty sovereigns fell into the tumbler. Everyone was taken aback, and there was a noise as if a bomb had burst, and the fireball disappeared, and rolled down the garden path, the landlord following it. After this they each drank what they liked, and Billy gave them a sovereign apiece before he went home.The next morning he was in his smithy making a pair of horseshoes, when the devil came in and said:“Well, Billy, I’ll want you this morning.”“Yes; all right. Take hold of this sledge-hammer, and give me a few hammers till I finish this job before I go.”So the devil seized the hammer and began striking the anvil, but he couldn’t stop.So Billy laughed, and locked him in, and was away three days. During this time the people collected round the smithy, and peeped through the cracks in the shutter, for they could hear the hammer going night and day.At the end of three days Billy returned and opened the door, and the devil said, “Oh, Billy, you’ve played a fine trick to me; let me go.”“What are you going to give me if I let you go?”“Seven years more, twice the money, and two days’ grace for wishing for what you like.”The devil paid his money and disappeared, and Billy shut the smithy and took to gambling and drinking, so that at the end of seven years he was without a penny, and working again in his smithy.On the last night of the seven years he went to his favourite public-house again, and wished for five pounds.After he wished, a little man entered and spat the sovereigns into the tumbler, and they all drank all night.Next morning Billy went back to his smithy. The devil, who had grown suspicious, turned himself into a sovereign and appeared on the floor. Billy seized the sovereign and clapped it into his purse. Then he took his purse and lay it upon the anvil, and began to beat it with his sledge-hammer, when the devil began to call out, “Spare my poor limbs, spare my poor limbs!”“How much now if I let you go?” asked Billy“Seven more years, three times the money, and one day in which to wish for what you like.”Billy took the sovereign out of his purse and threw it away, when he found his money in the smithy.Billy carried on worse than ever; gambled and drank and raced, squandering it all before his seven years was gone. On the last day of his term he went to his favourite inn as usual and wished for a tumbler full of sovereigns. A little man with a big head, a big nose, and big mouth, a little body, and little legs, with clubbed feet and a forked tail, brought them in and put them in the tumbler. The drunkards in the room got scared when they saw the little man, for he looked all glowing with fire as he danced on the table. When he finished, he said, “Billy, to-morrow morning our compact is up.”“I know it, old boy, I know it, old boy!” said Billy. Then the devil ran out and disappeared, and the people began to question Billy:“What is that? I think it is you, Mister Duffy, he is after.”“Oh, it is nothing at all,” said Billy.“I should think there was something,” said the man.“I am afraid my house will get a bad name,” croaked the landlord.“Not in the least! You are only a coward,” said Billy.“But in the name of God, what is it all about?” asked an old man.“Oh, you’ll see by-and-bye,” said Billy; “it is nothing at all.”Next morning Billy went to his smithy, but the devil would not come near it.So he went to his house, and began to quarrel with his wife, and whilst he was quarrelling the devil walked in and said:“Well, Mr. Duffy, I am ready for you.”“Ah, yes; just sit down and wait a minute or two. I have some papersI want to put to rights before I go.”So the devil sat down in the arm-chair, and Billy went to the smithy and heated a pair of tongs red-hot, and coming back, he got the devil by the nose, and pulled it out as though it had been soft iron. And the devil began yelling, but he could not move, and Billy kept drawing the nose out till it was long enough to reach over the window, when he put an old bell-topper on the end of it. And the devil yelled, and snorted fire from his nose.The whole of the village crowded round Billy’s, house—at a safe distance—calling out, “Billy and the devil! The devil and Billy Duffy!”The devil got awful savage, and blackguarded Billy Duffy terribly; but it was useless. Billy kept him there for days, till he got civil and said:“Mr. Duffy, what will you let me go for?”“Only one thing: I am to live the rest of my life without you, and have as much gold as I like.”The devil agreed, so Billy let him go; and immediately he grew rich. He lived to a good old age squandering money all the time, but at last he died and when he got to the gates of hell the clerk said “Who are you?” “Billy Duffy,” said he. And when the devil, who was standing near, heard, he said:“Good God! bar the gates and double-lock them for if this BillyDuffy the blacksmith gets in he will ruin us all.”Old Billy saw a pair of red-hot tongs, which he picked up, and seized the devil by the nose. When the devil pulled back his head he left a red-hot bit of his nose in the tongs.Then Billy Duffy went up to the gates of heaven and St. Peter asked him who he was.“Billy Duffy the blacksmith,” he answered.“No admittance! You are a bold, bad man,” said St. Peter.“Good God! what will I do?” said Billy, and he went back to the earth, where he and the piece of the devil’s nose melted into a ball of fire, and he roves the earth till this day as a will-o’-the-wisp.","['time', 'noble', 'hill', 'scene', 'supernatural', 'visitation', 'mysterious', 'occurrence', 'tallest', 'peak', 'agiochooks', 'indian', 'name', 'seat',

2079,irish,O'Donoghue,"It was in a poor little cabin somewhere in Ireland. It does not matter where. The walls were of rough stone, the roof was of thatch, and the floor was the hard earth. There was very little furniture. Poor as it was, the whole place was clean. It is right to tell this, because, unhappily, a good many cabins in Ireland are not clean. What furniture there was had been rubbed smooth and spotless, and the few dishes that there were fairly shone. The floor was as carefully swept as if the Queen were expected.The three persons who lived in the cabin had eaten their supper of potatoes and milk and were sitting before the turf fire. It had been a poor supper, yet a little of it that was left—a few potatoes, a little milk, and a dish of fresh water—had been placed on a bench outside the door. There was no light except that of the fire. There was no need of any other, and there was no money to spend on candles that were not needed.The three who sat before the fire, and needed no other light, were a young man, a young woman, and an elderly woman. She did not like to be called old, for she said, and quite truly, that sixty was not old for anybody who felt as young as she did. This woman was Mrs. O’Brien. The young man was her son, John, and the young-woman was his wife, Kitty.“Kitty,” said John, “it’s not well you’re lookin’ to-night. Are ye feelin’ anyways worse than common?”“It’s only a bit tired I am,” said Kitty, “wid the work I was afther doin’ all day. I’ll be as well as ever in the morning.”“It’s a shame, that it is,” said John, “that ye have to be workin’ that way, day afther day, and you not sthrong at all. It’s a shame that I can’t do enough for the three of us, and the more, maybe, that there’ll be, but you must be at it, too, all the time.”“What nonsinse ye’re talkin’, John,” Kitty answered. “What would I be doin’, settin’ up here like a lady, doin’ nothin’, and you and mother workin’ away like you was my servants? Did you think it was a duchess or the daughter of the Lord Lieutenant ye was marryin’, that ye’re talkin’ that way?”“And it’ll be worse a long time before it’s betther,” John went on. “Wid the three of us workin’ all the time, we just barely get along. And it’s the end of the summer now. What we’ll do at all when the winter comes, I dunno.”The older woman listened to the others and said nothing. Perhaps she had heard such talk as this so many times that she did not care to join in it again, or perhaps she was waiting to be asked to speak. For it was to her that these younger people always turned when they were in trouble. It was her advice and her opinion that they always asked when they felt that they needed a better opinion than their own. The three sat silent now for a time, and then John broke out, as if the talk had been going on in his mind all the while: “What’s the good of us tryin’ to live at all?” he said. “Is livin’ any use to us? We do nothin’ but work all day, and eat a little to give us the strength to work the next day, and then we sleep all night, if we can sleep. And it’s that and nothing else all the year through. Are we any better when the year ends than we were when it began? If we’ve paid the rent, we’ve done well. We never do more.”“John,” the old woman answered, “it’s not for us to say why we’re here or what for we’re living. It’s God that put us here, and He’ll keep us here till it’s our time to go. He has made it the way of all His creatures to provide for themselves and for their own, and to keep themselves alive while they can. When He’s ready for us to die, we die. That’s all we know. The rest is with Him.”“I know all that’s true, mother,” said John; “but what is there for us to hope for, that we’ld wish to live? It’s nothing but work to keep the roof over us. We don’t even eat for any pleasure that’s in it—only so that we can work. If we rested for a day, we’ld be driven out of our house. If we rested for another day, we’ld starve. Is there any good to be hoped for such as us? Will there ever be any good times for Ireland? I mean for all the people in it.”“There will,” the old woman said. “Everything has an end, and so these troubles of ours will end, and all the troubles of Ireland will end, too.”“And why should we believe that?” John asked again. “Wasn’t Ireland always the poor, unhappy country, and all the people in it, only the landlords and the agents, and why should we think it will ever be better?”“Everything has an end,” the old woman repeated. “Ireland was not always the unhappy country. It was happy once and it will be happy again. It’s not you, John O’Brien, that ought to be forgetting the good days of Ireland, long ago though they were. For you yourself are the descendant of King Brian Boru, and you know well, for it’s many times I’ve told you, how in his days the country was happy and peaceful and blessed. He drove out the heathen and saved the country for his people. He had strict laws, and the people obeyed them. In his days a lovely girl, dressed all in fine silk and gold and jewels, walked alone the length of Ireland, and there was no one to rob her or to harm her, because of the good King and the love the people had for him and for his laws. And you, that are descended from King Brian, ask if Ireland wasn’t always the poor, unhappy country.”“But all that was so long ago,” said John; “near a thousand years, was it not? Since then it’s been nothing but sorrow for the country and for the people. What good is it to us that the country was happy in King Brian’s time? Will that help us pay the rent? And how we’ll pay the rent when the winter comes, I dunno, and if we don’t pay it we’ll be evicted.”“Shaun,” said his mother, calling him by the Irish name that she used sometimes—”Shaun, we’ll not be evicted; never fear that. Things are bad, and they may be worse, but take my word, whatever comes, we’ll not be evicted.”“Mother,” said the young man, “you never spoke the word, so far as I know, that wasn’t true, but I dunno how it’ll be this time. We’ve been workin’ all we can and we only just manage to pay the rent and live, and here’s the summer over and the winter coming, and how will we pay the rent then?”The mother did not answer this question directly. She began talking in a way that did not seem to have anything to do with the rent, though it really had something to do with it, in her own mind, and perhaps in her son’s mind too.“It’s over-tired that you are with your hard day’s work, Shaun,” she said, “and that and seeing Kitty so tired, too, has maybe made you look at things a little worse than they are. We’ve never been so bad off as many of our neighbors; you know that. And yet I know it’s been worse of late and harder for you than it might have been, and you can’t remember the better times that our family had, and that’s why you forget that the times were ever better. No, you wasn’t born then, but the time was when good luck seemed to follow your father and me everywhere and always. Yes, and the good luck has not all left us yet, though we had the bad luck to lose your father so long ago. We could not hope to be rich or happy while the whole country was in such distress as it’s been sometimes, yet there were always many that were worse off than we, and when I think of those days of ’47 and ’48 it makes the sorrows seem light that we’re suffering now. And I always know that whatever comes, there’ll be some good for me and mine while I live. I’ve told you how I know that, but you always forget, and I must tell you again.”They had not forgotten. They knew the story that was coming by heart, but they knew that the old woman liked to tell it, so they let her go on and said not a word.For a little while, too, the old woman said not a word. She sat with her eyes closed, and smiling, as if she were in a dream. Then she began to speak softly, as if she were still only just waking out of a dream. “Blessed days there were,” she said—”blessed days for Ireland once—long ago—many hundreds of years. O’Donoghue—it was he was the good King, and happy were his people. A fierce warrior he was to guard them from their enemies, and a just ruler to those who minded his laws. It was in the West that he ruled, by the beautiful Lakes of Killarney. The rich and the poor among his people were alike in one thing—they all had justice. He punished even his own son when he did wrong, as if he had been a poor man and a stranger.“He gave grand feasts to his friends, and the greatest and the best men of all Erin came to sit at his table and to hear the wise words that he spoke. And the greatest bards of all Erin came to sing before him and his guests of the brave deeds of the heroes of old days and of the greatness and the goodness of O’Donoghue himself. At one of these feasts, after a bard had been singing of the noble days of Erin long ago, O’Donoghue began to speak of the years that were to come for Ireland. He told of much good and of much evil. He told how true and brave and noble men would live and work and fight and die for their country, and how cowards would betray her. He told of glory and he told of shame. He spoke of riches and honor, and poetry and beauty; he spoke of want and disgrace, and degradation and sorrow.“Those who sat at his table listened to him in wonder. Sometimes their hearts swelled with pride at the noble lives and deeds of those who were to come after them, sometimes they wept at the sufferings that their children were to feel, and sometimes they hid their faces from each other in shame at the tales of cowardice and of treachery.“As he finished speaking he rose from the table, crossed the hall, and walked out at the door and down to the shore of the lake. The others followed him and watched him, full of wonder. They saw him go to the edge of the lake and then walk out upon it, as if the water had been firm ground under his feet. He walked far and far out on the bright lake as they stood and gazed at him. Then he turned toward them, he waved his hand in farewell, and he was gone. They saw him no more.”The old woman paused for a moment and the dreaming look came back to her face. Then she went on. “They saw him no more—but others saw him—and I have seen him. Every year, on the 1st of May, just as the sun is rising, he rides across the lake on his beautiful white horse. He is not always seen, but sometimes a few can see him. And it always brings good luck to see O’Donoghue riding across the lake on May morning. And I saw him.”Again there was a pause, but she had no look of dreaming now. Her eyes were open and she seemed to be looking at something wonderful and beautiful that was far off. Slowly and softly she began speaking again. “I was a girl then. My father lived by the Lakes of Killarney. On that May morning I was standing at the door as the sun was rising. I was looking out upon the lake, far away to the east. The first that I saw was that the water, far off toward the sun, was ruffled, and then all at once a great, white-crested wave rose, as if a strong wind had struck the water, only all the air was still, and no wind ever raises such a wave as that on the lake. The wave came swiftly toward me, and I drew back, in a kind of dread, though I knew that it could not reach me where I stood. But still I looked—and then I saw him.“Through the flying water and foam and mist I saw the old King, on his white horse, following the great wave across the lake. The sun made all his armor gleam like the silver of the lake itself, and the plume of his helmet streamed away behind him like the spray that a strong wind blows back from the crest of a breaker. After him came a train of glowing, beautiful forms—spirits of the lake or of the air, or some of the Good People—I do not know. They wore soft, flowing garments, that were like the morning mists; they carried chains of pearls and they scattered other pearls about them, that glistened like the drops of a shower when the sun is shining through it. They had garlands of flowers, and they plucked the flowers out and threw them high in the air, so that they fell before the King. They looked like flecks of foam from the waves, turned rosy and violet by the rising sun, but they were flowers. And there was a sound of sweet, soft music, like harps and mellow horns.“The King and his train came nearer and I saw them plainer, and the music sounded louder. Then they passed me and moved far away again on the lake. The sight of them grew dim and the music grew faint, and I strained my eyes and my ears for the last of them, and they were gone. Then I could move and speak and breathe again, for it had seemed to me that I could not do any one of these things while the King was passing, and I knew that I had seen O’Donoghue.”The old woman stopped, as if the story were ended, but the younger people did not speak, for they knew that she had something else to tell. “O’Donoghue had passed and was gone,” she said, “but he always leaves good luck behind him, and he left the good luck with me. That summer some rich young ladies came from Dublin to see the Lakes of Killarney. They heard the story of O’Donoghue, and the people told them that I was the last who had seen him. They came to my father’s house and asked me to tell them what I had seen. They seemed pleased with what I told them, or with something that they saw in me, and they asked my father to let them take me back to the city with them, for a lady’s maid. He did not like to let me go, but they said that they would pay me well and would have me taught better than I could be at home. He was poor, there were others at home who needed all that he could earn, I wished to go, and at last he said I might.“So I went to Dublin and lived in a grand house, among grand people. I tried to do my duties well, and they were kind to me. They kept the promise that they had made to my father. They gave me books and allowed me time to study them, and they helped me in things that I could not well have learned by myself, even with the books. I was quick at study, and in the little time that I had, I learned all that I could. Three times they took me to London with them, and I saw still grander people and grander life.“Those were happy days, but happier came. Your father came, Shaun. He was a servant of the family, like myself—a coachman. But he was wiser than I, and he talked with me and showed me that there was something better for us than to be servants always. We saved all the money that we could, and when we had enough we came here, where your father had lived before, and took a little farm. The luck of O’Donoghue was always with us. We had a good landlord, who asked a fair rent. We both worked hard, we saved more money and took more land, and all our neighbors thought that we were prosperous, and so we were.“Then came ’47. Nobody could be prosperous then. Nobody that had a heart in him at all could even keep what he had saved then. What we had and what our neighbors had belonged to all, and little enough there was of it. It is well for you young people to talk of these times being hard. Harder than some they may be, but good and easy compared with those days of ’47 and ’48. You talk of injustice and wrong to Ireland! What think you of those times, when every day great ships sailed away from Ireland loaded down with food—corn and bacon, and beef and butter—and Ireland’s own people left without the bit of food to keep the life in them? All summer long was the horrible wet weather, and the potatoes rotting in the ground before they’ld be ripe, and never fit to eat. To add to all that was the fever, that killed its thousands, and then the cold. And when the days came again that the crops would grow, many and many of the people were so weak with the hunger and the sickness that they could not work in the fields. Ah! and you call these hard times!“Those were the bad days for Ireland, those days of ’47. Not even the luck of O’Donoghue could make us prosper or give us comforts then. But we lived through the time, as many others did. The poor helped those who were poorer than themselves; the sick tended those who were sicker; the cold gave clothes and fire to those who were colder. The little money that we had saved helped us and some of our neighbors. And we lived through it all.“Better times came, though never again so good as the old. We worked again and we saved a trifle. Then you were born to us, John. We had a worse landlord now. He was of the kind that cared nothing for his tenants and nothing for his land, but to get the last penny off it. The rent was raised, and we never could have paid it but for the care and the skill and the hard work of your father. And then, John, you know that when you were hardly old enough to take his place with the work, let alone knowing how to work as well as he, he died and left us—Heaven rest his soul!”For a long time the old woman said no more, and neither of the others spoke. Then she said: “John, the country is in trouble enough and the times are hard enough for you and for Kitty, here, and for all of us, I know. But don’t be cast down. There have been worse days than these; there have been better days, too, and there will be better again.”","['till', 'eighteenth', 'birthday', 'young', 'neangir', 'live', 'happily', 'village',

2103,irish,"Fin MacCumhail, the Seven Brothers, and the King of France","When Fin MacCumhail with seven companies of the Fenians of Erin was living at Tara of the Kings, he went hunting one day with the seven companies; and while out on the mountains seven young men came towards him and when they came up and stood before him he asked their names of them.Each gave his name in turn, beginning with the eldest, and their names were Strong, son of Strength; Wise, son of Wisdom; Builder, son of Builder; Whistler, son of Whistler; Guide, son of Guide; Climber, son of Climber; Thief, son of Thief.The seven young men pleased Fin; they were looking for service, so he hired them for a year and a day.When Fin and the Fenians of Erin went home that night from the hunt there was a message at the castle before them from the king of France to Fin MacCumhail and the Fenians of Erin, asking them to come over to him on a most important affair.Fin held a council straightway and said, “France is a thousand miles from this and the sea between it and Erin; how can we go to the king of France?”Then Strong, son of Strength, spoke up and said: “What is the use of hiring us if we can’t do this work and the like of it? If you’ll make a ship here, or in any place, I’ll pull it in the sea.”“And I,” said Builder, “will make a ship fit for you or any king on earth with one blow of this axe in my hand.”“That’s what I want,” said Fin, “and now do you make that ship for me.”“I will,” said Builder.“Well,” said Strong, “I’ll put your ship in the sea.”Builder made the ship there at Tara of the Kings and then Strong brought it to the seashore and put it in the water. Fin and the Fenians of Erin went on board, and Guide took the ship from Erin to France.When Fin and his men went to the king of France he was glad to see them and said:“I’ll tell you the reason now I asked you here, and the business I have with you. This time three years ago my wife had a son, two years ago a second, one year ago a third, and the neighbors’ wives are thinking she’ll have another child soon. Immediately they were born the three were taken away, and I want you to save the fourth; for we all think it will be taken from us like the other three. When each one of the others was sleeping, a hand came down the chimney to the cradle and took the child away with it up the chimney. There is meat and drink in plenty in that room for you and the Fenians of Erin. My only request is that you’ll watch the child.”“We’ll do that,” said Fin, and he went into the chamber with men enough to watch and the seven brothers with him. Then the seven said: “Do you and the men go to sleep for yourselves, and we’ll do the watching.” So Fin and the men went to sleep. The child was born early in the evening and put in the cradle. At the dead of night Wise said to Strong: “Now is your time; the hand is near; keep your eye on it.”Soon he saw the hand coming lower and lower and moving towards the child; and when it was going into the cradle, Strong caught the hand and it drew him up nearly to the top of the chimney. Then he pulled it down to the ashes; again it drew him up.They were that way all night,—the hand drawing Strong almost to the top of the chimney and out of the house and Strong dragging the hand down to the hearth. They were up and down the chimney till break of day; and every stone in the castle of the king of France was trembling in its place from the struggle.But at break of day Strong tore from its shoulder the arm with the hand, and there was peace. Now all rose up at the castle. The king came and was glad when he saw the child.Then Fin spoke up and said: “We have done no good thing yet till we bring back the other three to you.”Wise spoke up and said: “I know very well where the other three are, and I’ll show you the place.”So all set out and they followed him to the castle of Mal MacMulcan and there they saw the three sons of the King of France carrying water to MacMulcan to cool the shoulder from which the arm had been torn by Strong.Then Wise said to Climber: “Now is your time to take the children away; for we can do it without being seen; but if Mal MacMulcan were to see the children going from him, he’d destroy the whole world. But as it is when he finds the children are gone, he has a sister there near himself, and he’ll break her head against the wall of the castle.”Then Climber took a clew from his pocket and threw it over the walls of the castle, and the walls were so high that no bird of the air could fly over them. Then they fixed a rope ladder on the castle. Wise, Guide, and Climber went up the ladder and at break of day they brought away the three children and gave them to the king of France that morning. And the king of France was so glad when he saw his three sons that he said to Fin: “I will give you your ship full of the most precious stuffs in my kingdom.”“I will take nothing for myself,” said Fin; “but do you give what you like to my seven young men who have done the work;” and the seven said they wouldn’t take anything while they were serving with him. So Fin took the present from the king of France and set sail for Erin with the Fenians and the seven young men.While they were on the way to Erin they saw the sea raging after them. Wise, son of Wisdom, said: “That is Mal MacMulcan coming to get satisfaction out of us.”Then MacMulcan caught hold of the ship by the stern and pulled it down till the masts touched the sea. Strong caught him by the left remaining hand, and the two began to fight, and at last Strong pulled him on to the deck of the ship.“Our ship will be sunk,” said Wise, “and Fin with the Fenians of Erin and the seven of us will be drowned unless you make a flail out of MacMulcan and thrash the head off his body on the deck of the ship.”Strong made a flail out of MacMulcan and killed him, and the sea was filled with blood in a minute of time. Then the ship moved on without harm till they came to the same spot in Erin from which they had sailed.When Fin came to the place where he had hired the seven young men the year and a day were over. He paid them their hire and they left him. Then he came to his own castle at Tara of the Kings.One day Fin went out walking alone, and he met an old hag by the way. She spoke up to him and asked: “Would you play a game of cards with me?”“I would,” said Fin, “if I had the means of playing.”The old hag pulled out a pack of cards and said: “Here you have the means of playing as many games as you like.”They sat down and played; Fin got the first game on the old woman. Then she said, “Put the sentence on me now.”“I will not,” said Fin; “I’ll do nothing till we play another game.”They played again and she won the second game. Then she said to Fin, “You will have to go and bring here for me the head of Curucha na Gras and the sword that guards his castle; and I won’t give you leave to take away any of your men with you but one, and he is the worst of them all,—’Iron back without action,’ and the time for your journey is a year and a day. Now what is your sentence on me?” said the old hag.“You’ll put one foot,” said Fin, “on the top of my castle in Tara of the Kings, and the other on a hill in Mayo, and you’ll stand with your back to the wind and your face to the storm, a sheaf of wheat on the ground before the gate will be all you’ll have to eat, and any grain that will be blown out of it, if you catch that you’ll have it, and you’ll be that way till I come back.”So Fin went away with himself and “Iron back without action.” And when they had gone as far as a large wood that was by the roadside, a thick fog came on them, and rain, and they sat down at the edge of the wood and waited. Soon they saw a red-haired boy with a bow and arrows shooting birds, and whenever he hit a bird he used to put the arrow through its two eyes and not put a drop of blood on its feathers.And when the red boy came near Fin, he drew his bow, sent an arrow through “Iron back without action,” and put the life out of him.When he did that Fin said, “You have left me without any man, though this was the worst of all I have.”“You’d better hire me,” said the red boy; “you’ve lost nothing, for you were without a man when you had that fellow the same as you are now.”So Fin hired the red boy and asked him his name. “I won’t tell you that,” said he, “but do you put the name on me that’ll please yourself.”“Well,” said Fin, “since I met you in the rain and the mist I’ll call you Misty.”“That’ll be my name while I’m with you,” said the red boy, “and now we’ll cast lots to see which of us will carry the other;” and the lot fell upon Misty. He raised Fin on his back to carry him, and the first leap he took was six miles, and every step a mile, and he went on without stopping till he was in the Western World. When they came to the castle of Curucha na Gras, Fin and Misty put up a tent for themselves and they were hungry enough after the long road, and Misty said, “I will go and ask Curucha for something to eat.” He went to the castle and put a fighting blow on the door. Curucha came out and Misty asked him for bread.“I wouldn’t give you the leavings of my pigs,” said Curucha.Misty turned and left him, but on the way he met the bakers bringing bread from the bake house and he caught all their loaves from them and ran home to Fin. “We have plenty to eat now,” said Misty, “but nothing at all to drink. I must go to Curucha to know will he give us something to drink.”He went a second time to the castle, put a fighting blow on the door, and out came Curucha.“What do you want this time?” asked he.“I want drink for myself and my master, Fin MacCumhail.”“You’ll get no drink from me. I wouldn’t give you the dirty ditch-water that’s outside my castle.”Misty turned to go home, but on the way he met twelve boys each carrying the full of his arms of bottles of wine. He took every bottle from them, and it wasn’t long till he was in the tent.“Now we can eat and drink our fill.”“We can indeed,” said Fin. Next morning Misty put another fighting blow on the door of the castle. Out flew Curucha with his guardian sword in his hand, and he made at Misty. With the first blow he gave him, he took an ear off his head.Misty sprang back, drew his bow, and sent an arrow into Curucha’s breast. It flew out through his head and he fell lifeless on the ground. Then Misty drew his knife, cut off the head, and carried the head and the sword to Fin MacCumhail, and Fin was glad to get them both.“Take the head,” said Misty, “and put it on top of the holly bush that’s out here above us.” Fin put the head on the holly bush, and the minute he put it there the head burnt the bush to the earth, and the earth to the clay.Then they took the best horse that could be found about Curucha’s castle. Fin sat on the horse, with the sword and head in front of him; and Misty followed behind.They went their way and never stopped till they came to the place where Misty sent the arrow through “Iron back without action” and killed him. When they came to that spot, Misty asked Fin would he tell him a story, and Fin answered, “I have no story to tell except that we are in the place now where you killed my man.”“Oh, then,” said Misty, “I’m glad you put that in my mind for I’ll give him back to you now.” So they went and took “Iron back without action” out of the ground; then Misty struck him with a rod of enchantment which he had, and brought life into him again.Then Misty turned to Fin and said: “I am a brother of the seven boys who went with you to save the children of the king of France. I was too young for action at that time, but my mother sent me here now as a gift to help you and tell you what to do. When you go to the hag she’ll ask you for the sword, but you’ll not give it, you’ll only show it to her. And when she has seen the sword she’ll ask for the head. And you’ll not give the head to her either, you’ll only show it; and when she sees the head, she’ll open her mouth with joy at seeing the head of her brother; and when you see her open her mouth be sure to strike her on the breast with the head; and if you don’t do that, the whole world wouldn’t be able to kill her.”Then Fin left Misty where he met him and with “Iron back without action” he made for Tara of the Kings.When he came in front of the old hag she asked him had he the gifts. Fin said he had. She asked for the sword but she didn’t get it, Fin only showed it to her. Then she asked for the head, and when she saw the head, she opened her mouth with delight at seeing the head of her brother.While she stood there with open mouth gazing, Fin picked out the mark and struck her on the breast with the head. She fell to the ground; they left her there dead and went into the castle.","['gipsy', 'engage', 'servant', 'devil', 'devil', 'give', 'wish', 'bring', 'firewood', 'water', 'regularly', 'fire',

2197,irish,The Story of Conn-Eda,"King Conn of Ireland had one noble son named Conn-eda, and he was as dear to his father as the apple of his eye, — none dearer. His mother had died while he was still a child, and after a while the King, his father, married again. He married the young daughter of his chief priest, but he did not marry her because he loved her, and that is the truth. He married her because his councilors told him that it was a wise thing for him to do, for this chief priest was very powerful.The new Queen was a cruel woman, and her hatred of Conn-eda was bitter and deep. She hated him because he was so handsome and free- hearted, and she hated him because he was so dear to his father, but most of all she hated him because every one looked to him as the one who would sometime be their king, and there was no knowing how soon that would be, for already his father was old and feeble.After a while the young Queen had a child of her own, and then she hated Conn-eda worse than ever and was always plotting how she could get rid of him, for she wanted the kingdom to come to her own son.Now there was a woman who lived down back of the castle in a poor tumble-down hut, and it was said that she knew more than a little about magic, and every one was afraid of her. Shewas the hen-wife, and had charge of all the chickens that belonged to the castle. She was a handsome woman and a strange one, and no one could tell whether she were young or old, and she might have been either.One day the Queen went by herself down to the hut to visit the hen-wife, for she wished to ask her advice. She was not ashamed to go, either, because of the woman being an enchantress.“Queen Durfulla,” said the hen-wife, “I know why you have come to me, and what you are after wanting.”That surprised the Queen, and she said, “What is it I am wanting, then?”“You are wanting to rid yourself of young Conn-eda, and it is for my advice you have come hither. But I am not one to give something for nothing. What reward will I have if I give you my advice?”“What reward will you be wanting?” asked the Queen.“It ’s none so much and none so little. Give me enough wool to fill the hole between my arm and body when I set my hand on my hip with my elbow out, and give me enough red wheat to fill the hole I shall bore with my distaff, and my advice is yours for the asking.”Well, the Queen could not help smiling at that, for it seemed but a small reward for any one to ask, and she gladly agreed to give it.“Then have the wool and the wheat brought here to-morrow,” said the hen-wife. “Twenty cartloads of wool, and twenty cartloads of wheat will be none too much to fill the hollow between my arm and body and the hole I’ll make.”The Queen thought that was a strange thing to say, and that the hen-wife must be dreaming, but all the same she was back at the hen-wife’s door the next day, and close after her came twenty cartloads of wool and twenty cartloads of wheat, with the horses pulling and the carters cracking their whips.The hen-wife stood in the doorway with her hand on her hip and her elbow out, and the men took an armful of wool and put it in the hollow of her arm, but it fell through the hollow and in- side the house. They stuffed another armful in between her arm and body, and the same thing happened to it. Not until the house was so full of wool that it could hold no more were they able to fill the hollow of the hen-wife’s arm as she stood in the doorway.“And now for the wheat,” said the hen-wife.Then she led them to her brother’s house which was close by, and climbed up on the roof. The roof was of peat, and she bored a hole down through the peat with her distaff, so that as fast as they poured the wheat into the hole, it ran down into the house, and not until the house was so full that it could hold no more could they fill the hole, too.“Now I am satisfied,” said the hen-wife, but that was more than the Queen could say, for she was a mean woman. However, if the hen-wife could tell her how to rid herself of Prince Conn-eda, it was more to her than all the wheat and wool that ever were grown.“Now listen well to what I tell you,” said the hen-wife. “You have paid me faithfully and fully, and I am ready to keep my part of the bargain, too. Far and far enough from here, there lies a great dark lake, and the name of it is Lough Erne. Under its waters lives the King of the Fiborg race, a race that lives in the water most happily. There, in the King’s garden, grow three golden apples. In his stable stands a grand black steed. In his castle lies the puppy-hound Samur, and great are the magic powers of that hound. You must send Conn-eda to get these things for you, and to fetch them back within a year and a day and it ’s not a living being who can seek those things and not lose his life in the seeking, unless he has magic to help him.”“But how can I send Conn-eda?” asked the Queen, “for he is not a child that he must do my bidding.”“That also I will tell you,” replied the hen-wife.She then brought out a chessboard and chess- men and gave them to the Queen. “Do you take these home with you,” she said, “and call Conn-eda to come and play a game of chess with you. I have set a charm on the men, and I have set a charm on the board, so that you will be sure to win ; but before you play you must make a bargain with the Prince that whichever loses shall pay a forfeit to the winner, and the forfeit you shall ask of him is that he fetch to you the three things I have told you of. But be sure that you play only the one game, for after that is played the charm will lose its power.”The Queen was pleased with the advice the hen-wife gave her, and she took the chessboard and the chessmen and promised to do in all things as she had been told. Then she hastened back to the castle.No sooner was she there than she sent for Conn-eda to come and have a game of chess, and he came at her command and sat down at the board with her.“It is not for nothing we will play together this day,” said the Queen, “ but whichever loses shall pay a forfeit to the other, and the forfeit shall be whatever the winner chooses to demand.”To this Conn-eda agreed. He had it in his head that the Queen was planning some trick against him, but he did not fear her, for he made sure he could beat her at the game.So they sat down to play, and Conn-eda was a good player, and the Queen was a poor one, but it seemed as though there were a mist before the Prince’s eyes, and when he thought he had made one play he found he had made another, and presently he saw he had lost the game, and the Queen was the winner.Then she laughed aloud and pushed the board from her. “The game is mine, Conn-eda,” she cried, “and it is for you to pay the forfeit. Whatever I ask for, that shall you pay, no matter what be the cost.”When the Prince heard that, his heart was troubled within him, and he said to her, “What is that forfeit that you will demand of me ?”“This is the forfeit,” the Queen replied.“Within a year and a day you shall bring to me three golden apples, and a grand black steed, and the magic puppy-hound Samur and they all belong to the King of the Fiborg people. He lives at the bottom of Lough Erne, but where that is I know not, and you must find it for yourself/’When the Prince Conn-eda heard that, he knew the Queen had indeed tricked him, and the forfeit he was like to pay was that of his life. But he dissembled and hid his fear, and said, “The forfeit I will pay, if it be in mortal power to do so. And now we will play another game, and again it shall be for a forfeit, with the loser to pay it.”The Queen was so full of triumph that she forgot the warning of the hen-wife and willingly agreed to play once more with Conn-eda.But now the magic had gone out of the board, and this time the Prince was the winner.When the Queen found she had lost, her face grew pale, and her heart sank down within her.“You have won, Conn-eda,” said she. “And what is the forfeit I must pay to you?”“The forfeit is this,” said Conn-eda. “For the year and the day that I am away, you must sit at the top of the highest tower of the castle and eat nothing but as much red wheat as you can pick up with the point of your bodkin.”That was a hard fate for the Queen, but after all, it would be only for a year and a day, and at the end of that time she would be free again and rid of Prince Conn-eda forever, so the bargain was not so hard as it seemed at first hearing. So the Queen went up and took her place in the high tower, and the Prince mounted his horse and rode out into the world in search of the golden apples, the grand black steed, and the magic puppy-hound Samur.But first Conn-eda went to a Wise Man he knew, who was a friend of his. Many and many a favor the Prince had done for him, and now it was time to ask one in return.The Wise Man heard Conn-eda galloping up and came out of the house to meet him, and the Prince lighted down from his horse and greeted him respectfully.“I am in great trouble,” Conn-eda began, “and I have come to you to see if you can help me.“That I guessed at once from your face,” replied the Wise Man, “and you had best begin at the beginning and tell me the whole story, for it ‘ s only after I Ve heard the whole of it that I’ll best know how to help you.”So the Prince began and told the Wise Man the whole matter from beginning to end. He told of the Queen’s hatred toward him and of the ways she had tried to injure him ; he told of how she had bidden him to play a game of chess with her, and of how he had feared her and yet made no doubt of winning the game ; and he told of how in some strange way he had become the loser, and how the Queen had claimed a forfeit from him, and what it was she had claimed.“And we played still again, and that time it was for her to pay the forfeit” ; and he told what the forfeit was that he had demanded of her.“And it was no more than her just dues,” said the Wise Man. “I make no doubt but that the Queen has sought to make you lose your life in this business, and it was a clever brain that thought out this trick. There is some one back of it other than the Queen.”He thought for a while, and then he spoke again. “ There is but one person who would have known of the golden apples, the grand black steed, and the magic hound Samur, and that one is the Wise Woman who lives in the hut down back of the palace. She calls herself a hen-wife, but of a truth she is Carlleach of Lough Corib, and the sister of the Water King himself. There are four of the water people, three brothers and one sister. The first is King of the Fiborgs, and the second is under some enchantment. The third lives in a house next to that of the hen-wife, and the fourth is Carlleach herself. And now, my son, I will do what I can to help you. Where Lough Corib is I know not, but out in my stable is a little shaggy black horse. He is not much to look at, but he is great in power. Take him and ride whithersoever he carries you, and leave the rein loose on his neck that he may choose his own way. He will take you to the crag where the Bird of Wisdom sits. Three days in everythree years the bird sits there, and it’s little that goes on in the world that he does not know about. This is the time for him to be sitting on the crag, and if he will but speak, he can tell you how to set about finding the lake and the Water King’s treasures.”The Wise Man then took out a very beautiful and very precious jewel from a box that stood on a shelf behind the door and gave it to Conn-eda.“If the Bird of Wisdom will not speak,” said he, “give him this jewel in his claw, and then it may be that he will answer you.”Conn-eda took the jewel and thanked the Wise Man kindly, and then he went out to the stable and led forth the shaggy little black horse and mounted himself on him, instead of his own fine steed, and indeed the little horse was not much to look at. But no sooner was Conn-eda on his back than he found what a worth-while horse he was, for away he went lighter than a bird and swifter than the wind, and it was like no other riding that Conn-eda had ever done.A long way and a short way went the shaggy black horse, and all the while Conn-eda let therein lie loose, so that the horse was free to choose his own way, and then they came within sight of a cliff, and on the cliff sat a great gray bird. It sat so still it might have been a part of the rocks for any motion that it had, and the eyes in its head were as dull as cold, dead stones.The horse halted before the cliff and bade the Prince speak to the bird. “For it is the Bird of Wisdom of which the Wise Man spoke,” said he, “and unless it can tell us what to do next we might as well turn back the way we came for we ’ll never win to the lake where the King of the Fiborgs lives.”Then Conn-eda lifted up his voice and called to the bird. Three times he called to it, but the bird never stirred even a feather, but sat there still as though it were carved from the rocks.Then the shaggy steed said, “Give it the jewel, Conn-eda, and perchance it will speak.”The Prince took the jewel from his bosom where he carried it and held it up so that it sparkled in the sunlight, and again he called to the bird ; and this time it turned its head and looked at him, and its eyes grew bright as though a fire were lighted within it. Then it flew down and caught the jewel in its claw and flew back with it to the cliff.There it sat, and opened its beak, and cried in a harsh voice, “Conn-eda! Conn-eda ! Son of the King of Cruachan, I know why you have come and what you would have of me. Light down and lift the stone that is close to the right forefoot of your steed. Under it you will find a ball and a cup. Take them up, for you will have need of both of them. The ball you must roll before you and follow wherever it leads you. It will bring you to the place whither you would go. The cup you will need later.”Then the Bird of Wisdom closed its beak, and the light died out of its eyes, and again it sat as still and gray as though there were no breath of life in it.Conn-eda lighted down and looked for the stone the bird had told him of, and he could not miss it for the horse’s right fore hoof was against it. He lifted it up and there he found a cup and ball. The cup he placed in the bosom of his shirt, but the ball he threw before him, according to the bird’s bidding, and on and on it rolled, up hill and down dale, over bog and through briars, with Conn-eda on the shaggy steed following hard after it.After a while it led them to the edge of a lake so dark and deep you might have thought there was no bottom to it, and into this lake the ball bounded and so was lost to sight. The Prince was in despair. “Now what are we to do ?” cried he. “If we follow the ball, we are like to be drowned in the deep waters of the lough, and if we do not follow it, we will never win to the palace of the Water King.”But the shaggy steed bade him take heart. “We must indeed still follow the ball,” said he, “but even so it is possible no harm may come to us. And now sit tight, my master.” With that the horse plunged into the lough, and down and down through the still cold waters.Conn-eda sat close, as the steed bade him, and presently they came through the water and out into a land of pleasant meadows and flowing streams. The lake was above them like a sky, with the sun shining down through it, and not a hair of either of them was wet, and the ball was lying there at their feet.“Now Conn-eda, light down,” said the steed, “and reach your hand first into one of my ears and then into the other. In the one you will find a small wicker basket, and in the other a flask of heal-all water. We will need them both, for now we are drawing near to the dangerous part of the adventure.”The Prince did as he was told and put his hand into the horse’s ears, first into one and then into the other. In the one he found the wicker basket and in the other the flask of water. Then he mounted again and off he rode, and the ball that had been lying still all this time rolled be- fore them to show the way, and they followed close after it.After a bit they came to the end of the meadow and there was a great stretch of water with a causeway leading across it, and along the cause- way rolled the ball. But Conn-eda drew rein, and no wonder, for the causeway was guarded by three great fiery serpents. They lay there stretched across and across it, and the smoke rose up from their breathing in three great columns, and as the Prince looked at them, his heart melted within him like wax, for they were a fearful sight.But the shaggy steed bade him take heart. “It’s the truth, Conn-eda, that we must pass those fiery serpents,” he said. “Backward we cannot go, so forward we must. Now open the basket, and you will find in it three pieces of meat. As I leap over the serpents you must throw one piece into the mouth of each of them. If you do this, we may pass safely over them, and pray that your aim be good, for if you miss the mouth of any of them, it will be death both for you and me.”So Conn-eda opened the lid of the basket and found the pieces of meat and took them out, and the steed set out along the causeway, straight toward where the monsters lay.“The serpents reared up and opened their fiery jaws.” Illustration by Katharine Pyle, published in Fairy Tales from Far and Near by Katharine Pyle (1922), Little, Brown, and Company.As horse and rider came near them, the serpents reared up and opened their fiery jaws, and made at Conn-eda and his steed as though to devour them ; but the Prince was ready, and as the steed leaped over them Conn-eda threw a piece of meat into each of the flaming mouths ; not one of them did he miss.At once the serpents were satisfied, and their heads sank down, and they lay as though asleep. But the steed alighted on the causeway far beyond them, and Conn-eda’s hands held lightly to the reins.“Conn-eda, are you still astride of me ?”“ I am,” answered the Prince, “and none the worse for the danger we passed over.”“Now it comes to me that you are a noble and heroic Prince,” said the steed, “and I have high hopes that we may win through all our adven- tures with great reward to both of us at the end of them.”Then on they went, and on they went until they came to a flaming mountain, and the heat of it was very great.“Are you sitting firm on my back ?” asked the shaggy black horse.“ I am sitting firm,” replied the Prince.“ Then stir not. Look neither to the right nor left, nor up nor down, for I am going to leap over the mountain, and if my leap is broken by somuch as a hairbreadth, we will both fall into the flames, and that will be the end of us.”When Conn-eda heard this, fear seemed to clutch at the very heart of him, but he settled himself in the saddle, and when the horse leaped, he kept in mind what had been said to him, and looked neither to the right hand nor the left, nor up nor down, nor stirred so much as a hair- breadth in his seat.The good steed carried him over, but they were not so high above the mountain but what the flames came up and licked Conn-eda’s feet and his clothing.“Are you still alive, Conn-eda?” asked the steed, when they alighted upon the other side of it.“I am just alive, and no more,” replied Conn- eda, “for I am greatly scorched.”“That is both well and ill,” said the horse. “Well that you are still alive, and ill that you are so sore burned. Take the flask and rub some of the heal-all that is in it on your burns, and they will pass away.”This Conn-eda did, and at once his burns disappeared as though they had never been there, and his flesh and skin were all well and sound again.“The worst of our dangers are over now,” said the shaggy black horse, “but other things are still to be done that you may find hard in the doing. Now mount and ride again, and I can tell you we are not far from the palace of the Water King, whither we would be going.”Conn-eda mounted again, and on they rode and fast they went, and then they came within sight of a castle, with shining domes and turrets, and great golden gateways.Here the shaggy steed bade the Prince again light down.“Now, Conn-eda, listen well and answer truly,” said the steed, “for on what happens next hangs both your fate and my own. So now tell me of a truth, have I served you well ?”“ None could have served better,” replied the Prince.“Have I saved your life, or have I risked it ?”“You have saved it, and except for you I would have lost it far back on the road.”“And now the time has come to prove whether or no you are grateful. Put your hand in my ear and take out the dagger you will find there. Fear not and shrink not, but drive it into my heart, for thus and thus only can you reward me for what I have done for you.”When the Prince heard these words from the steed, he was filled with horror. “Never, never will I do such a cruel and wicked thing,” he cried. “Rather would I drive the dagger into my own heart than into yours.”“ If you will not, you will not,” said the shaggy black horse, “but this I tell you plainly ; except you do this thing, both you and I must perish.”Well, the steed talked on and on, and at last Conn-eda consented to do as he was asked, though it seemed to him his hand must wither in the doing.“That is well,” cried the steed, as soon as he had consented. “And now I will tell you what further you must do. As soon as you have driven the dagger into me, strip off my hide, and get into it yourself. You will then be free to go in and out of the castle as you please, though otherwise you would be slain by the people there the moment you entered. Go through the golden gateway in the center, and the first thing you will see is a leaping silver fountain. Fill the cup you found beneath the stone with this water and bring it back and sprinkle the water over me. Then all will be well. But oh, Conn-eda, haste haste in your going and coming, for as soon as you have left me, the birds of prey will gather about me, and if they tear me to pieces, there will be no further help for me.”Conn-eda promised to do in all things as the steed bade him, and he then put his hand in its ear and found the dagger it had told him about. But he trembled so that he had scarce strength to even so much as point the dagger at the steed, let alone strike him. But this was all that was needed, for as soon as the dagger was turned toward him, it flew forward, carrying Conn- eda’ s hand with it, and buried itself to the hilt in the steed’s heart, so that he fell dead.Then the Prince wept bitter tears over his dead companion. After awhile he arose and took the dagger to strip off the hide as he had promised ; but there was no need of cutting, for no sooner did he catch hold of the hide than it came off like a loose glove from the hand within it, and the hide was as soft and fine as though it had been tanned by the king of tanners.Conn-eda got into the hide, and then he did not stay nor tarry but hastened away to the cas- tle, as the steed had bidden him, and in through the golden gateway.There within was a great hall with many people moving about in it, and warders at the door, but no one spoke to him nor stayed him. In the center of the hall was the leaping silver fountain of which the steed had told him, and to this the Prince hastened and he filled his cup with its water, and then back he ran the way he had come, to where the steed was lying.But swift as had been his going and coming, he was only just in time, for already the birds of prey were gathering, and he had to fight them with his sword before he could drive them away. Then he sprinkled the water from the cup upon the body of the steed, and no sooner had he done this than a strange thing happened, for at once the steed was gone, and there in its place stood a young and handsome prince, and he was so tall and so noble in his air that Conn-eda had never seen the like of him.The young man came over to Conn-eda and took him in his arms, and his face was streaming with tears, but they were tears of joy.“Conn-eda,” said he, “you have saved me from a hard and cruel fate, and little did I think I would ever come back into my own shape again and live as other men do. I am own brother to the Water King, and it was because of a cruel enchantment that I was obliged to go about in the shape of a shaggy little black horse.“ The enchantment held me fast, and only if one would ride me back to the castle and through true love would slay me and sprinkle me with water from the fountain, could the spell be broken.“This you have done for me, Conn-eda, and never will I forget what I owe you. And now come with me back to the castle of my brother, that he may make you welcome.”So Conn-eda and his companion went back to the castle, and there the joy was so great that the king gave Conn-Eda the treasures the Queen had requested. The Queen saw him coming up the road, and when she saw he brought what she sought, she threw herself from the tower in despair. Conn-eda planted the three golden apples in his garden and instantly, a great tree bearing the same fruit grew. The rest of the land was fertile and rich, with plenty of crops for all. And so Conn-eda ruled for many years with his people blessed with a rich abundance during his reign. So great a ruler was he that the province of Connacht, or Conn-eda, was named for him.","['upon', 'time', 'dwelt', 'land', 'erin', 'young', 'seek', 'wife', 'maiden', 'round', 'none', 'pleased',

2220,irish,Gilla na Grakin and Fin MacCumhail,"There was a blacksmith in Dun Kinealy beyond Killybegs, and he had two young men serving him whose names were Césa MacRi na Tulach and Lun Dubh MacSmola.When their time was up the young men settled with the blacksmith and took their pay of him. After they had eaten breakfast in the morning they went away together.When they had gone some distance from the house they changed their gait, so that when they took one step forward they took two backwards; and when evening came they were not five perches away from the house where they had eaten breakfast in the morning.Then one said to the other: “I suppose what is on one of us is on the other.”“What’s that?” asked the first.“We are both in love with Scéhide ni Wánanan.”“That is true,” said the other, “we are both in love with the blacksmith’s maid.”When this was said they turned and went back to the house. The blacksmith welcomed them, and was glad.“You need not welcome us,” said they; “we have not come back to you to seek hire; but we are both in love with Scéhide ni Wánanan, and you’ll have to settle the matter for us.”“Well,” said the blacksmith, “I can do that. We’ll open the two doors of the forge, and let you and the maiden go in and stand in the middle of the place. Then do you two go out, one at each door, and the man she’ll follow will have her.”The three came in,—one man went out at each door of the forge; Scéhide followed Lun Dubh.When he saw this Césa spoke up, and said: “I’m willing to leave her with you; but turn back a moment here to me, for the word that’ll be between us.”Lun Dubh turned back into the forge, and Césa said: “Put your finger on this anvil.”Lun Dubh put his finger on the anvil. Césa, catching up a good spike, which the old blacksmith had made, and a hammer drove the spike through the finger of Lun Dubh, fastening him to the anvil.“Now,” said Lun Dubh to Césa; “let me go free, and do you take Scéhide; but I must have the first blow on you in battle or war, or wherever else I meet you in the world.”“I will give you that,” said Césa. So he freed his comrade from the anvil. The young men parted from each other,—Lun Dubh went one way alone, and Césa another with Scéhide ni Wánanan.As Césa went along he bought a skin at every house where he could find one, until he had enough to make clothes in which to disguise himself; for he was in dread of Lun Dubh, on account of the first blow which he had the right to strike when they met.He put on the skin clothes, and changed his name to Gilla na Grakin (the fellow of the skins).Gilla and his wife held on their way till they came to the castle of Fin MacCumhail; and the time they came there was no one in the place but women.“Where is Fin MacCumhail with his men to-day?” asked Gilla na Grakin.“They are all out hunting,” said the women.Now Gilla saw that the castle stood with open door facing the wind, and turning again to the women he asked: “Why do you have the door of the castle to the wind?”“When Fin and his men are at home and the wind comes in at the door, they all go out, take hold of the castle and turn it around till the door is on the sheltered side.”When Gilla na Grakin heard this he went out, put his hands to the castle, and turned it around till the door was on the sheltered side.In the evening when Fin and the Fenians of Erin were coming from the hunt, they saw the castle turned around, and Fin said to the men: “I’m afraid we haven’t half enough of game for the supper of the strangers who have come to visit us to-day, there are so many of them that they have turned the castle around.”When they came home they saw there was no man there but Gilla na Grakin, and they wondered at the work he had done.Gilla stood before Fin, and said: “Do you want a serving man?”“I do indeed,” said Fin.“What wages will you give me for a year and a day?” asked Gilla.“What yourself will ask,” replied Fin.“I won’t ask much,” said Gilla; “five pounds for myself, and a room in the castle for my wife.”“You shall have both,” said Fin.“I’m your man now,” said Gilla. The whole company spent the first part of that night in ease, the second in sport, and the third in a short sleep.The next morning all the Fenians of Erin were going to hunt, as the day before, and Fin said to Gilla na Grakin: “Will you take any man to help you?”“I’ll take no man with me but myself; and do you let me go in one part of the country alone, and go yourself with all your men in another part.”“Well,” said Fin, “will you find dry glens of ridges, or go in deep boggy places where there is danger of drowning?”“I will go in deep boggy places.”All left the castle to hunt. Fin and the Fenians of Erin went in one direction, and Gilla na Grakin in another, and hunted all day.When they came home in the evening Gilla na Grakin had a thousand times more game than Fin and all his men together.When Fin saw this he was glad to have such a good man, and was pleased beyond measure with Gilla na Grakin. The whole company spent that night as they had the night before,—in ease and sport and sleep.Next day Conan Maol was outside with Fin, and he said: “Gilla na Grakin will destroy the Fenians of Erin and put you and all of us to death, unless you banish him in some way from this castle.”“Well;” said Fin to Conan Maol, “I’ve never had a good man but you wanted me to put him away. And how could I banish such a man as this if I tried?”“The way to banish him,” said Conan Maol, “is to send him to the king of Lochlin to take from him the pot of plenty that’s never without meat, but has always enough in it to feed the whole world, and bring that pot to this castle.”Fin called Gilla na Grakin, and said: “You’ll have to go for me now to the king of Lochlin, and get from him the pot of plenty that is never without meat, and bring it here to me.”“Well,” said Gilla, “as long as I’m in your service I can’t refuse to do your work.”So away went Gilla. He took a glen at a step and a hill at a leap till he came to the shore of the sea, where he caught up two sticks, put one across the other, then gave them a tip of the hand, and a fine vessel rose out of the two pieces of wood.Gilla na Grakin went on board the vessel, hoisted the sails, and off he went in a straight line. The music he heard on his way was the whistling of eels in the sea and the calling of gulls in the air, till he came under the king’s castle in Lochlin. When he came, there were hundreds of ships standing near the shore, and he had to anchor outside them all; then he stepped from ship to ship till he stood on land.What should there be at the time he landed but a great feast in the castle of the king. So Gilla went to the front of the castle and stood outside at the door; but he could go no further for the crowd, and no one looked at him. At last he shouted: “This is a very hospitable feast, and you are a people of fine manners not to ask a stranger is he hungry or thirsty.”“You are right,” said the king, who turned to the people and said: “Give the pot of plenty to the stranger till he eats his fill.”The people obeyed the king, and when Gilla na Grakin got hold of the pot he made for the ship, and never stopped till he was on board. He put the pot in a safe place below. Then standing on deck he said to himself: “It is no use to take the pot by my swiftness unless I take it by my strength.”So he turned and went to land again. All the heroes and champions of the king of Lochlin and his whole army were ready to fight, but if they were so was Gilla na Grakin.When he came up to the army he began and went through it as a hawk goes through a flock of swallows, till he made one heap of their heads and another heap of their weapons. Then he went to the castle, caught the king in one hand and the queen in the other, and putting them under his two arms brought them out in front of the castle and killed each with the other.All was quiet and still at the castle. There wasn’t a man alive to stand up against Gilla na Grakin, who went to his ship, raised the sails, and started for Erin. All he heard was the spouting of whales, the whistling of eels, the calling of gulls, and the roar of the wind, as the ship rushed back to the place where he had made it in Erin. When he reached that place he gave the ship a tip of his hand, and there before him was the pot of plenty, and with it the two sticks which he had found on the shore of the sea when he was going to the castle of the king of Lochlin.He left the sticks where he found them, put the pot on his back, and hurried away to the castle of Fin MacCumhail.Fin and all the Fenians of Erin were glad to see Gilla na Grakin, and Fin thanked him for the work he had done.The first part of that night they spent in ease, the second in sport, the third in a hurried sleep.Next morning they rose and had breakfast from the pot. From that day out they hunted for pleasure alone. They had enough and to spare from the pot of plenty.Another day Conan Maol was outside the castle with Fin, and he said: “Gilla na Grakin will destroy you and me and all of us unless we find some way of putting him to death.”“What do you want him to do now?” asked Fin.“Let him go,” said Conan Maol, to the king of the Flood, “and bring back the cup that is never drained.”Fin went to the castle and called up Gilla na Grakin. “I want you to go now,” said he, “to the king of the Flood, and bring me his cup that is never dry.”When he heard Fin’s words, Gilla went off without delay; he took a glen at a step, and a hill at a leap, till he came to the sea. There he took up two sticks of wood, threw one across the other, and they became a fine large ship.Away he sailed in a straight line, listening as he went to the spouting of whales, the whistling of eels and the calling of gulls, and never stopped till he anchored outside the castle of the king of the Flood. There was many a ship at land before him, so he stopped outside them all, and stepped from ship to ship till he reached the shore.The king of the Flood was giving a great feast that day. Gilla na Grakin went to the castle, but could not enter, so great was the throng. He stood at the door a while, and then called out, “You are an ill-mannered people, not to ask a stranger is he hungry or dry!”The king heard these words, and said, “You are right;” and turning to his people said, “Give this stranger the cup till he drinks his fill.”As soon as ever Gilla got the cup in his hands, he made for the ship and never stopped till he put the cup in the hold of the vessel. Then he came on deck, and thought, “It’s no use to take the cup with my swiftness, unless I take it with my strength.”So back he turned to the castle, and when he reached land, the whole army and all the champions of the king of the Flood stood ready to oppose him. When he came up, he went through them as a hawk through a flock of swallows. He made a heap of their heads in one place, and a heap of their weapons in another, and then went back to the ship without thinking of the king and the queen of the Flood—forgot them.He raised his sails and went away, listening to music on the sea till he touched land in Erin. Then he took the cup in one hand, struck the ship with the other, turned it into the two sticks which he had found on the shore, and travelled on till he came to the castle of Fin MacCumhail and gave up the cup.“You’re the best man I have ever had,” said Fin; “and I give you my thanks and praise for the work you have done.”In the castle they spent the first part of that night in ease, the second in sport, and the third in a hurried sleep.Next morning said Fin to the Fenians of Erin, “We needn’t leave the house now unless we like. We have the best of eating from the pot, and the best of drinking from the cup. The one is never empty, and the other is never dry, and we’ll go hunting in future only to pass the time for ourselves.”One day Conan Maol was out with Fin a third time, and said he: “If we don’t find some way to kill Gilla na Grakin, he’ll destroy you and me, and all the Fenians of Erin.”“Well,” asked Fin, “where do you want to send him this time?”“I want him to go to the eastern world, and find out what was it that left the Gruagach with but the one hair on his head.”Fin went to the castle, called up Gilla na Grakin, and said:“You must go for me now to the eastern world, to know what was it that left the Gruagach with the one hair on his head.”“Well,” said Gilla, “I never knew that you wanted to put me to death till this minute; I know it now. But still so long as I’m in your service I can’t refuse to do your work.”Then Gilla na Grakin stepped out of the castle door, and away he went to the eastern world. He took a glen at a step, a hill at a leap, and lochs and seas at a bound till he entered the Gruagach’s house in the eastern world.“What is your errand to me,” asked the Gruagach, “and why have you come to my house?”“I have come,” said Gilla, “to know what was it that left you with the one hair on your head.”“Sit down here and rest yourself to-night, and if you are a good man, I’ll tell you to-morrow,” said the Gruagach.When bedtime came the Gruagach said: “There is an iron harrow there beyond, with teeth on both sides of it; go now and stretch yourself on that harrow, and sleep till morning.”When daylight came, the Gruagach was on his feet, and asked Gilla was he up.“I am,” said he. After they had eaten breakfast, the Gruagach went to another room and brought out two iron loops. One of these he put on Gilla’s neck, and the other on his own, and then they began to jerk the loops and pull one another and they fought till late in the afternoon; neither had the upper hand, but if one man was weaker than the other, that man was Gilla na Grakin.“And now,” thought he to himself, “the Gruagach will take my life, and my wife will never know what became of me.” The thought gave him strength and power, so up he sprang, and with the first pull he gave he put the Gruagach to his knees in the ground, with the second he put him to his waist, with the third to his shoulders.“Indeed,” said Gilla, “it would be easier for me to strike the head off you now, than to let you go; but if I took your head I shouldn’t have my master’s work done.”“If you let me go,” said the Gruagach, “I’ll tell you what happened to me, and why I have but the one hair on my head.”Gilla set him free, then the two sat down together, and the Gruagach began:—“I was living here, without trouble or annoyance from any man, till one day a hare ran in, made an unseemly noise under that table there, and insulted us. I was here myself at the time with my wife and my son and my daughter; and we had a hound, a beagle, and a black horse.“The hare ran out from under the table, and I made after the hare, and my wife and son and daughter, with the horse and the two dogs, followed me.“When the hare was on the top of a hill, I had almost hold of his hind legs, but I never caught him.“When night was near, the hare came to the walls of a great castle, and as he was jumping over, I hit him a blow on the hind leg with a stick, but in he went to the castle.“Out came an old hag, and screamed, ‘Who is it that worried the pet of this castle!’“I said it was myself that did it. Then she faced me, and made at me and the fight began between us. We fought all that night, and the next day till near evening. Then she turned around and pulled a Druidic rod out of herself, ran from me and struck my wife and son and daughter and the two hounds and the horse with the Druidic rod and made stones of them.“Then she turned on me again and there wasn’t but the one hair left on my head from the desperate fighting, and she looked at me, and said:“‘I’ll let you go this time but I’ll give you a good payment before you leave.’ She caught hold of me then in the grip of her one hand and with the other she took a sharp knife and stripped all the skin and flesh off my back, from my waist to my heels. Then, taking the skin of a rough shaggy goat, she clapped it on to me in place of my own skin and flesh, and told me to go my way.“I left the old hag and the castle behind, but the skin grew to me and I wear it to this day.” And here the Gruagach turned to Gilla na Grakin and showed him the goatskin growing on his body in place of his own skin and flesh.“Well,” said Gilla, when he saw the shaggy back of the Gruagach, “does that hare come here to insult you yet?”“He does, indeed,” said the Gruagach, “but I haven’t taken a bite nor a sup off that table since his first visit.” “Let us sit down there now,” said Gilla na Grakin.They sat down at the table, but they were not sitting long till the hare came, repeated the insult, and ran out.Gilla na Grakin made after the hare, and the Gruagach after Gilla.Gilla ran as fast as ever his legs could carry him, and he was often that near that he used to stretch his arm out after the hare, and almost catch him; but he never touched him till near night, when he was clearing the wall. Then Gilla caught him by the two hind legs, and, swinging him over his own shoulder, dashed him against the wall, tore the head from the body, and sent it bounding across the courtyard of the castle.Out rushed an old hag that minute. She had but one tooth and that in her upper jaw, and she used this tooth for a crutch.“Who has killed the pet of this castle!” shrieked she.“It was I that killed him,” said Gilla na Grakin. Then the two made at one another,—the hag and Gilla. They fought all that night and next day. With their fighting they made the hard rocks soft, and water to spring out through the middle of them. All the land of the eastern world was trembling as the evening drew near, and if one of the two was getting weak from the struggle and tired, that one was Gilla na Grakin. When he saw this he thought to himself, “Isn’t it a pity if an old hag puts me to death, me, who has put to death many a strong hero.”At this thought he sprang up and seized the hag. With the first thrust which he gave her into the ground he put her to the knees, with the second to her waist, with the third to her shoulders.“Now,” said the old hag to Gilla, “don’t kill me, and I’ll give you the rod of druidism (enchantment), which I have between my skin and flesh.”“Oh, you wicked old wretch! I’ll have that after your death, and no thanks to you,” said Gilla. With that he swept the head off of her with a single blow.Then the head jumped at the body, and tried to get its place again, but Gilla stood between them, and kept the head off till the body was cold. Then he took out the rod of enchantment from between the skin and the flesh, and threw the body and the head of the old hag aside.The Gruagach came up, and Gilla said, “Show me now the stones which were once your wife and children, your dogs and your horse.”The Gruagach went with him to the stones. Gilla struck each with the rod, and the wife, the son, the daughter, the hounds and the horse of the Gruagach were alive again.When this was done, Gilla turned to the Gruagach, struck the goatskin from his body, and gave him his own skin and flesh back again with the power of the rod.When all were restored, they started for the Gruagach’s house, and when there the Gruagach said to Gilla na Grakin,—“Stay here with me till you get your rest. We won’t leave this place for a year and a day, and then I’ll go with you to the castle of Fin MacCumhail and give witness to Fin of all that has happened to me and all you have done.”“Oh,” said Gilla na Grakin, “I can’t stay to rest, I must go now!”The Gruagach was so glad that he had got back all his family and his own flesh that he followed Gilla, and they set out for the castle of Fin MacCumhail in Erin.They took a glen at a step, a hill at a leap, and the sea at a bound.Conan Maol, who was outside the castle when they came in sight, ran in and said to Fin, “Gilla na Grakin and the Gruagach are coming, and they’ll destroy all that’s about the castle, and all that’s inside as well!”“If they do,” said Fin, “it’s your own fault, and you have no one to blame but yourself.”“Well,” said Conan Maol, “I’ll lie down here in the cradle, and put a steel cap on my head.”Conan lay down in the cradle. Gilla and the Gruagach came into the castle. The Gruagach sat down near the cradle. Then he said to Fin, “I came here with Gilla na Grakin to bear witness to you of all that has happened to me, and of all he has done.”Then he told Fin the whole story of what they had gone through and what they had done.With that the Gruagach put his hand behind him and asked: “How old is this child lying here in the cradle?”“Only three years,” said Fin’s wife.Then the Gruagach took the steel cap between his thumb and fingers, thinking it was the head of the child, and squeezed till the steel cracked with a loud snap, but the child didn’t cry.“Oh, there’s the making of a man in him. If he gets age he’ll be a champion,” said the Gruagach.Next day the Gruagach left Fin’s castle and went to his own place and family.Gilla na Grakin’s time was now up, for he had served a year and a day.Fin went out to wash himself in a spring near the castle, and when he looked into the spring a spirit spoke up out of the water to him and said:“You must give back his cup to the king of the Flood, or you must give him battle in its place.”Fin went back to the castle, lamenting the state he was in.Conan Maol said, “You look like a sorrowful man.”“Why shouldn’t I be?” said Fin. “A spirit spoke to me from the spring outside, and told me I must give back the cup to the king of the Flood, or give him battle in place of it. Now Gilla’s time is up, and I don’t know what to do.”“Well,” said Conan Maol, “do you go now and speak to him, and maybe he’ll do you a good turn.”Fin went to Gilla na Grakin, and told him what happened at the spring.“My time is up, as you know,” said Gilla, “and I cannot serve on time that is past; but if you want me to go, you must watch my wife Scéhide ni Wánanan on Friday night; and in the middle of the night, when she is combing her hair, any request you’ll make of her she can’t refuse. The request you’ll make is that she’ll let me go with you to the king of the Flood, to take the cup to his castle and bring it back again.”Fin watched the time closely, and when the middle of Friday night came, he looked through a hole in the door and saw Scéhide combing her hair. Then he asked his request of her.“Well,” answered she, “I can’t refuse, but you must promise me to bring back Gilla, dead or alive.”Fin promised her that.Next morning Fin MacCumhail and Gilla na Grakin set out for the castle of the king of the Flood, taking the cup with them.They walked over Erin till they came to the shore of the sea. There Gilla caught up two pieces of wood, and putting one across the other, struck them a tip of his fingers, and out of them rose a fine ship. He and Fin went on board, sailed away, and never stopped till they cast anchor outside all the ships, under the castle of the king of the Flood. The two walked on from deck to deck till they stood on shore.They went a short distance from the castle of the king and pitched a tent.Said Gilla to Fin, “Now we are hungry, and I must find food for you and myself.”So Gilla na Grakin went to the castle and asked food of the king of the Flood.“You’ll get nothing to eat from me. I have no food in this place to give you or the like of you; but there is a wild bull in the wood outside. Find him: if you kill him, you’ll have something to eat; if not you’ll go fasting,” said the king of the Flood to Gilla na Grakin.Gilla went out to the wood, and when the wild bull saw a man coming towards him he drove his horns into the ground, and put an acre of land over his own back. Then he threw up an oak-tree, roots and all, till it nearly reached the sky, and made at Gilla na Grakin. But if he did, Gilla was ready for him and faced him, and when the bull came up, he caught him by the horns and threw him to the ground; then putting a foot on one horn, he took the other in his two hands, split the bull from muzzle to tail, and made two halves of him.Gilla carried the carcass to the tent, and when he had taken off the skin he said to Fin, “We have no pot to boil the meat in. Well, I’ll go to the king again.”So off he went and knocked at the castle door.“What do you want now?” asked the king.“I want a pot,” said Gilla, “to boil the wild bull.”“Well,” said the king, “I have no pot for you but that big pot back in the yard, in which we boil stuff for the pigs. I’ll give you the loan of that if you are able to carry it.”“It’s good to get that itself from a bad person,” said Gilla na Grakin, and away he went to look for the pot behind the castle.At last he found it, and when he put it down at the tent he said to Fin, “We have nothing now to boil the pot with, nothing to make a fire.”Then he went a third time to the castle, knocked at the door, and out came the king. “What do you want now?” asked he.“Fire to boil the bull.”“Go to the wood and get firewood for yourself, or do without it. You’ll get no firewood from me,” said the king of the Flood.Gilla went out, got plenty of wood and boiled the whole bull.“We are well off now,” said he to Fin; “we have plenty to eat.”Next morning Gilla na Grakin went to the castle and knocked.“Who is that?” asked the king, without opening the door.“I want no chat nor questions from you,” said Gilla, “but get me a breakfast.” “I have no breakfast now,” said the king; “but wait a minute and you’ll get a hot breakfast from me.”That moment the signal was sounded for the armies of the king of the Flood to take Gilla na Grakin and his master.When the armies stood ready Gilla began and went through them as a hawk through sparrows. He made one heap of their heads and another of their weapons,—didn’t leave a man living. Then he went into the castle and taking the king of the Flood in one hand and the queen in the other, he killed each of them against the other.Now all was quiet at the castle. Gilla na Grakin struck the tent and went to the ship with Fin MacCumhail, who had the cup that was never dry.They raised the sails and went over the sea toward Erin, till they saw a large ship on one side of them.“If it’s going to help us that ship is,” said Fin, “’tis all the better for us, but if ’tis going against us she is, that’s the bad part of it.”As the ship came near, Gilla na Grakin looked at her sharply, and said to Fin, “I think it’s Lun Dubh that’s on that ship.”“Well,” said Fin, “maybe he’ll not know you in a strange dress.”When Lun Dubh came alongside, he called out: “I know you well, and it’s not by your dress that I know you, Césa MacRi na Tulach.” Then Lun Dubh sprang on deck, raised his hand, struck Gilla, and stretched him dead.Fin sailed away with the body of Gilla na Grakin, and when he came in sight of the shore of Erin he raised a black flag; for he had promised Gilla’s wife to raise a white flag if her husband was well, but a black one if he was dead.When he came to the shore, Scéhide ni Wánanan was there before him, and she had a large, roomy box. When she saw Fin she said, “You have him dead with you?”“I have,” said Fin.“What will you do with him now?” asked she.“I will bury him decently,” said Fin.“You will not,” said she; “you will put him in this box.”Then Fin put him in the box. She went aside and got some fresh shamrock and went into the box with Gilla. Then she told Fin to push the box out to sea, and putting down the cover fastened it inside.Fin pushed the box out into the sea, and away it went driven by wind and waves, till one day Scéhide looked out through a hole and saw two sparrows flying and a dead one between them. The two living sparrows let the dead one down on an island. Soon they rose up again, and the dead one was living.Said Scéhide to herself, “There might be something on that island that would cure my husband as it cured the dead bird.”Now the sea put the box in on the island. Scéhide unfastened the cover, came out, and walked around the island. Nothing could she find but a small spring of water in a rock. “It’s in this the cure may be,” thought she, as she looked at the water. Then taking off one of her shoes she put it full of the water, took it to the box, and poured it on Gilla na Grakin. That moment he stood up alive and well. Gilla walked along the shore till he found two pieces of wood. He threw one across the other, gave them a tip of his hand, a fine large ship stood there at the shore, and in it he sailed with Scéhide back to Erin.When they landed he turned the vessel into two sticks again with a tip of the hand, and set out with his wife for the castle of Fin MacCumhail in TirConal.They came to the castle of Fin at midnight. Gilla knocked and said, “Put my wages out to me.”“Well,” said Fin inside, “there is no man, alive or dead, that has wages on me but Gilla na Grakin, and I would rather see that fellow here than the wages of three men.”“Well, rise up now and you’ll see him,” said Gilla.Fin rose up, saw his man, gave him his wages with thanks and Gilla departed.At the break of day they saw a great house before them. A man walked out with a kerchief bound on his head.When Gilla na Grakin came up, he knew the man, and raising his hand, struck him dead with a blow.“I have satisfaction on Lun Dubh, now,” said Gilla to the wife. The two went into the house and stayed there, and may be there yet for anything we know. We are the luck and they are the winners.","['asks', 'little', 'shall', 'obtain', 'much', 'live', 'three', 'brother', 'whose', 'property', 'bright', 'world', 'consist', 'pear-tree', 'watch',

2222,irish,Shaking-Head,"There was once a king of a province in Erin who had an only son. The king was very careful of this son, and sent him to school for good instruction.The other three kings of provinces in Erin had three sons at the same school; and the three sent word by this one to his father, that if he didn’t put his son to death they would put both father and son to death themselves.When the young man came home with this word to his father and mother, they were grieved when they heard it. But the king’s son said that he would go out into the world to seek his fortune, and settle the trouble in that way. So away he went, taking with him only five pounds in money for his support.The young man travelled on till he came to a grave-yard, where he saw four men fighting over a coffin. Then he went up to the four, and saw that two of them were trying to put the coffin down into a grave, and the other two preventing them and keeping the coffin above ground. When the king’s son came near the men, he asked: “Why do you fight in such a place as this, and why do you keep the coffin above ground?”Two of the men answered, and said: “The body of our brother is in this coffin, and these two men won’t let us bury it.”The other two then said: “We have a debt of five pounds on the dead man, and we won’t let his body be buried till the debt is paid.” The king’s son said: “Do you let these men bury their brother, and I will pay what you ask.”Then the two let the brothers of the dead man bury him. The king’s son paid the five pounds, and went away empty-handed, and, except the clothes on his back, he had no more than on the day he was born. After he had gone on his way awhile and the grave-yard was out of sight he turned and saw a sprightly red-haired man (fear ruadh) hurrying after him. When he came up, the stranger asked: “Don’t you want a serving man?”“I do not,” answered the king’s son, “I have nothing to support myself with, let alone a serving man.”“Well, never mind that,” said the red-haired man; “I’ll be with you wherever you go, whether you have anything or not.”“What is your name?” asked the king’s son.“Shaking-head,” answered the red man.When they had gone on a piece of the way together the king’s son stopped and asked: “Where shall we be to-night?”“We shall be in a giant’s castle where there will be small welcome for us,” said Shaking-head.When evening came they found themselves in front of a castle. In they went and saw no one inside, only a tall old hag. But they were not long in the place till they heard a loud, rushing noise outside, and a blow on the castle. The giant came; and the first words he let out of his mouth were: “I’m glad to have an Erinach on my supper-table to eat to-night.” Then turning to the two he said: “What brought you here this evening; what do you want in my castle?”“All the champions and heroes of Erin are going to take your property from you and destroy yourself; we have come to warn you, and there is nobody to save you from them but us,” said Shaking-head.When the giant heard these words he changed his treatment entirely. He gave the king’s son and Shaking-head a hearty welcome and a kindly greeting. When he understood the news they brought, he washed them with the tears of his eyes, dried them with kisses, and gave them a good supper and a soft bed that night.Next morning the giant was up at an early hour, and he went to the bedside of each man and told him to rise and have breakfast. Shaking-head asked his reward of the giant for telling him of the champions of Erin and the danger he was in.“Well,” said the giant, “there’s a pot of gold over there under my bed; take as much out of it as ever you wish, and welcome.”“It isn’t gold I want for my service,” said Shaking-head; “you have a gift which suits me better.”“What gift is that?” asked the giant.“The light black steed in your stable.”“That’s a gift I won’t give you,” said the giant, “for when any one comes to trouble or attack me, all I have to do is to throw my leg over that steed, and away he carries me out of sight of every enemy.”“Well,” said Shaking-head, “if you don’t give me that steed I’ll bring all the kingdom of Erin against you, and you’ll be destroyed with all you have.”The giant stopped a moment, and said: “I believe you’d do that thing, so you may take the steed.” Then Shaking-head took the steed of the giant, gave him to the king’s son, and away they went.At sunset Shaking-head said: “We are near the castle of another giant, the next brother to the one who entertained us last night. He hasn’t much welcome for us either; but he will treat us well when he is threatened.”The second giant was going to eat the king’s son for supper, but when Shaking-head told him about the forces of Erin he changed his manner and entertained them well.Next morning after breakfast, Shaking-head said: “You must give me a present for my services in warning you.”“There is a pot of gold under my bed,” said the giant; “take all you want of it.”“I don’t want your gold,” said Shaking-head, “but you have a gift which suits me well.”“What is that?” asked the giant.“The two-handed black sword that never fails a blow.”“You won’t get that gift from me,” said the giant; “and I can’t spare it; for if a whole army were to come against me, as soon as I’d have my two hands on the hilt of that sword, I’d let no man near me without sweeping the head off him.”“Well,” said Shaking-head, “I have been keeping back your enemies this long time; but I’ll let them at you now, and I’ll raise up more. I’ll put the whole kingdom of Erin against you.”The giant stopped a moment, and said: “I believe you’d do that if it served you.” So he took the sword off his belt and handed it to his guest. Shaking-head gave it to the king’s son, who mounted his steed, and they both went away.When they had gone some distance from the giant’s castle Shaking-head said to the king’s son, “Where shall we be to-night?—you have more knowledge than I.” “Indeed then I have not,” said the king’s son; “I have no knowledge at all of where we are going; it is you who have the knowledge.”“Well,” said Shaking-head, “we’ll be at the third and youngest giant’s castle to-night, and at first he’ll treat us far worse and more harshly, but still we’ll take this night’s lodging of him, and a good gift in the morning.”Soon after sunset they came to the castle where they met the worst reception and the harshest they had found on the road. The giant was going to eat them both for supper; but when Shaking-head told him of the champions of Erin, he became as kind as his two brothers, and gave good entertainment to both.Next morning after breakfast, Shaking-head asked for a present in return for his services.“Do you see the pot of gold in the corner there under my bed?—take all you want and welcome,” said the giant.“It’s not gold I want,” said Shaking-head, “but the cloak of darkness.”“Oh,” said the giant, “you’ll not get that cloak of me, for I want it myself. If any man were to come against me, all I’d have to do would be to put that cloak on my shoulders, and no one in the world could see me, or know where I’d be.”“Well,” said Shaking-head, “it’s long enough that I am keeping your enemies away; and if you don’t give me that cloak now I’ll raise all the kingdom of Erin and still more forces to destroy you, and it’s not long you’ll last after they come.”The giant thought a moment, and then said: “I believe you’d do what you say. There’s the black cloak hanging on the wall before you; take it.”Shaking-head took the cloak, and the two went away together, the king’s son riding on the light black steed, and having the double-handed sword at his back. When out of sight of the giant, Shaking-head put on the cloak, and wasn’t to be seen, and no other man could have been seen in his place. Then the king’s son looked around, and began to call and search for his man,—he was lonely without him and grieved not to see him. Shaking-head, glad to see the affection of the king’s son, took off the cloak and was at his side again.“Where are we going now?” asked the king’s son.“We are going on a long journey to (Ri Chuil an Or) King Behind the Gold, to ask his daughter of him.”The two travelled on, till they came to the castle of King Behind the Gold. Then Shaking-head said: “Go in you, and ask his daughter of the king, and I’ll stay here outside with the cloak on me.” So he went in and spoke to the king, and the answer he got was this:—“I am willing to give you my daughter, but you won’t get her unless you do what she will ask of you. And I must tell you now that three hundred kings’ sons, lacking one, have come to ask for my daughter, and in the garden behind my castle are three hundred iron spikes, and every spike of them but one is covered with the head of a king’s son who couldn’t do what my daughter wanted of him, and I’m greatly in dread that your own head will be put on the one spike that is left uncovered.”“Well,” said the king’s son, “I’ll do my best to keep my head where it is at present.”“Stay here in my castle,” said the king, “and you’ll have good entertainment till we know can you do what will be asked of you.” At night when the king’s son was going to bed, the princess gave him a thimble, and said: “Have this for me in the morning.”He put the thimble on his finger; and she thought it could be easily taken away, if he would sleep. So she came to him in the night, with a drink, and said: “I give you this in hopes I’ll gain more drink by you.” He swallowed the liquor, and the princess went away with the empty cup. Then the king’s son put the thimble in his mouth between his cheek and his teeth for safe keeping, and was soon asleep.When the princess came to her own chamber, she struck her maid with a slat an draoichta (a rod of enchantment) and turned her into a rat; then she made such music of fifes and trumpets to sound throughout the castle, that every soul in it fell asleep. That minute, she sent the rat to where the king’s son was sleeping, and the rat put her tail into the nostrils of the young man, tickled his nose so that he sneezed and blew the thimble out of his mouth. The rat caught it and ran away to the princess, who struck her with the rod of enchantment and turned her into a maid again.Then the princess and the maid set out for the eastern world, taking the thimble with them. Shaking-head, who was watching with his cloak on, unseen by all, had seen everything, and now followed at their heels. In the eastern world, at the sea-side was a rock. The princess tapped it with her finger, and the rock opened; there was a great house inside, and in the house a giant. The princess greeted him and gave him the thimble, saying: “You’re to keep this so no man can get it.”“Oh,” said the giant, taking the thimble and throwing it aside, “you need have no fear; no man can find me in this place.”Shaking-head caught the thimble from the ground and put it in his pocket. When she had finished conversation with the giant, the princess kissed him, and hurried away. Shaking-head followed her step for step, till they came at break of day to the castle of King Behind the Gold. Shaking-head went to the king’s son and asked: “Was anything given you to keep last night?”“Yes, before I came to this chamber the princess gave me her thimble, and told me to have it for her in the morning.”“Have you it now?” asked Shaking-head.“It is not in my mouth where I put it last night, it is not in the bed; I’m afraid my head is lost,” said the king’s son.“Well, look at this,” said Shaking-head, taking the thimble out of his pocket and giving it to him. “The whole kingdom is moving to-day to see your death. All the people have heard that you are here asking for the princess, and they think your head’ll be put on the last spike in the garden, with the heads of the other kings’ sons. Rise up now, mount your light black steed, ride to the summer-house of the princess and her father, and give her the thimble.”The king’s son did as Shaking-head told him. When he gave up the thimble, the king said, “You have won one third of my daughter.” But the princess was bitterly angry and vexed to the heart, that any man on earth should know that she had dealings with the giant; she cared more for that than anything else.When the second day had passed, and the king’s son was going to bed, the princess gave him a comb to keep, and said: “If you don’t have this for me in the morning, your head will be put on the spike that’s left in my father’s garden.”The king’s son took the comb with him, wrapped it in a handkerchief, and tied it to his head.In the night the princess came with a draught which she gave him, and soon he was asleep. Going back to her own chamber, she struck the maid with her rod of enchantment, and made a great yellow cat of her. Then she caused such music of fifes and trumpets to sound throughout the castle that every soul was in a deep sleep before the music was over, and that moment she sent the cat to the chamber of the king’s son. The cat worked the handkerchief off his head, took out the comb and ran with it to the princess, who turned her into a maid again.The two set out for the eastern world straightway; but as they did, Shaking-head followed them in his cloak of darkness, till they came to the house of the giant in the great rock at the end of the road, at the sea. The princess gave the giant the comb, and said: “The thimble that I gave you to keep last night was taken from you, for the king’s son in Erin brought it back to me this morning, and has done one third of the work of winning me, and I didn’t expect you’d serve me in this way.”When the giant heard this, he was raging, and threw the comb into the sea behind him. Then with Druidic spells he raised thunder and lightning and wind. The sea was roaring with storm and rain; but the comb had not touched the water when Shaking-head caught it.When her talk was over the princess gave the giant a kiss, and home she went with the maid; but Shaking-head followed them step by step.In the morning Shaking-head went to the king’s son, roused him, and asked: “What was your task last night?”“The princess gave me a comb to have for her this morning,” answered the king’s son.“Where is it now?” asked Shaking-head.“Here on my head,” said the king’s son, putting up his hand to get it; but the comb was gone. “I’m done for now,” said the king’s son; “my head will be on the last spike to-day unless I have the comb for the princess.”“Here it is for you,” said Shaking-head, taking the comb out of his pocket. “And now,” said he, “the whole kingdom is coming to this castle to-day to see your head put on the last spike in the garden of King Behind the Gold, for all men think the same will happen to you that has happened to every king’s son before you. Go up on your steed and ride to the summer-house where the king and his daughter are sitting, and give her the comb.”The king’s son did as Shaking-head bade him. When he saw the comb the king said, “Now you have my daughter two-thirds won.” But her face went from the princess entirely, she was so vexed that any man should know of her dealings with the giant.The third night when he was going to bed the princess said to the king’s son, “If you will not have at my father’s castle to-morrow morning the head I will kiss to-night, you’ll die to-morrow, and your own head will be put on the last spike in my father’s garden.” Later in the night she came to the bedside of the king’s son with a draught, which he drank, and before she was back in her chamber, he slept. Then she made such music all over the castle that not a soul was awake when the music had ceased. That moment she hurried away with her maid to the eastern world; but Shaking-head followed her in his cloak of darkness. This time he carried with him the two-handed sword that never failed a blow.When she came to the rock in the eastern world and entered the house of the giant, the princess said, “You let my two gifts go with the son of the king in Erin, and he’ll have me won to-morrow if he’ll have your head at my father’s castle in the morning.”“Never fear,” said the giant, “there is nothing in the world to take the head off me but the double-handed sword of darkness that never fails a blow, and that sword belongs to my brother in the western world.”The princess gave the giant a kiss at parting; and as she hurried away with her maid the giant turned to look at her. His head was covered with an iron cap; but as he looked he laid bare a thin strip of his neck. Shaking-head was there near him, and said in his mind: “Your brother’s sword has never been so close to your neck before;” and with one blow he swept the head off him. Then began the greatest struggle that Shaking-head ever had, to keep the head from the body of the giant. The head fought to put itself on again, and never stopped till the body was dead; then it fell to the ground. Shaking-head seized, but couldn’t stir the head,—couldn’t move it from its place. Then he searched all around it and found a (bar an suan) pin of slumber near the ear. When he took the pin away he had no trouble in carrying the head; and he made no delay but came to the castle at daybreak, and threw the head to a herd of pigs that belonged to the king. Then he went to the king’s son, and asked:“What happened to you last night?”“The princess came to me, and said that if I wouldn’t bring to her father’s castle this morning the head she was to kiss last night, my own head would be on the last spike to-day.”“Come out with me now to the pigs,” said Shaking-head.The two went out, and Shaking-head said: “Go in among the pigs, and take the head with you to the king; and a strange head it is to put before a king.”So the king’s son went on his steed to the summer-house, and gave the head to the king and his daughter, and turning to the princess, said:“This is the head you kissed last night, and it’s not a nice looking head either.”“You have my daughter won now entirely,” said the king, “and she is yours. And do you take that head to the great dark hole that is out there on one side of my castle grounds, and throw it down.”The king’s son mounted his steed, and rode off with the head till he came to the hole going deep into the earth. When he let down the head it went to the bottom with such a roaring and such a noise that every mare and cow and every beast in the whole kingdom cast its young, such was the terror that was caused by the noise of the head in going to the bottom of the hole.When the head was put away the king’s son went back to the castle, and married the daughter of King Behind the Gold. The wedding lasted nine days and nights, and the last night was better than the first.When the wedding was over Shaking-head went to the king, and said: “You have provided no fortune for your daughter, and it is but right that you should remember her.”“I have plenty of gold and silver to give her,” said the king.“It isn’t gold and silver that your son-in-law wants, but men to stand against his enemies, when they come on him.”“I have more treasures than men,” said King Behind the Gold; “but I won’t see my daughter conquered for want of an army.”They were satisfied with the king’s word, and next day took the road to Erin, and kept on their way till they came opposite the grave-yard. Then Shaking-head said to the king’s son: “You are no good, you have never told me a story since the first day I saw you.”“I have but one story to tell you, except what happened since we met.”“Well, tell me what happened before we met.”“I was passing this place before I saw you,” said the king’s son, “and four men were fighting over a coffin. I spoke to them, and two of them said they were burying the body of their brother which was in the coffin, and the others said the dead man owed them five pounds, and they wouldn’t let the coffin into the ground until they got the money. I paid five pounds and the body was buried.”“It was my body was in the coffin,” said Shaking-head, “and I came back into this world to do you a good turn; and now I am going, and you’ll never see me again unless trouble is on you.”Shaking-head disappeared, and the king’s son went home. He wasn’t with his father long till the other three kings’ sons heard he had come back to Erin with the daughter of King Behind the Gold. They sent word, saying: “We’ll take the head off you now, and put an end to your father and yourself.”The king’s son went out to walk alone, and as he was lamenting the fate he had brought on his father, who should come along to meet him but Shaking-head.“What trouble is on you now?” asked he.“Oh, three kings’ sons are coming with their fleets and armies to destroy my father and myself, and what can we do with our one fleet and one army?”“Well,” said Shaking-head, “I’ll settle that for you without delay.” Then he sent a message straight to King Behind the Gold, who gave a fleet and an army, and they came to Erin so quickly that they were at the castle before the forces of the three kings’ sons. And when the three came the battle began on sea and land at both sides of the castle.The three fleets of the three kings’ sons were sunk, their armies destroyed, and the three heads taken off themselves. When the battle was over and the country safe the king resigned the castle and power to his son, and the son of a king in a province became king over all the land of Erin.","['betushka', 'little',

2223,irish,The Golden Spears,"Once upon a time there lived in a little house under a hill, a little old woman and her two children, whose names were Connla and Nora. Right in front of the door of the little house lay a pleasant meadow, and beyond the meadow rose up to the skies a mountain whose top was sharp-pointed like a spear. For more than half-way up it was clad with heather, and when the heather was in bloom it looked like a purple robe falling from the shoulders of the mountain down to its feet. Above the heather it was bare and grey, but when the sun was sinking in the sea, its last rays rested on the bare mountain top and made it gleam like a spear of gold, and so the children always called it the “Golden Spear.”In summer days they gambolled in the meadow, plucking the sweet wild grasses––and often and often they clambered up the mountain side, knee deep in the heather, searching for frechans and wild honey, and sometimes they found a bird’s nest––but they only peeped into it, they never touched the eggs or allowed their breath to fall upon them, for next to their little mother they loved the mountain, and next to the mountain they loved the wild birds who made the spring and summer weather musical with their songs.Sometimes the soft white mist would steal through the glen, and creeping up the mountain would cover it with a veil so dense that the children could not see it, and then they would say to each other: “Our mountain is gone away from us.” But when the mist would lift and float off into the skies, the children would clap their hands, and say: “Oh, there’s our mountain back again.”In the long nights of winter they babbled of the spring and summertime to come, when the birds would once more sing for them, and never a day passed that they didn’t fling crumbs outside their door, and on the borders of the wood that stretched away towards the glen.When the spring days came they awoke with the first light of the morning, and they knew the very minute when the lark would begin to sing, and when the thrush and the blackbird would pour out their liquid notes, and when the robin would make the soft, green, tender leaves tremulous at his song.It chanced one day that when they were resting in the noontide heat, under the perfumed shade of a hawthorn in bloom, they saw on the edge of the meadow, spread out before them, a speckled thrush cowering in the grass.“Oh, Connla! Connla! Look at the thrush––and, look, look up in the sky, there is a hawk!” cried Nora.Connla looked up, and he saw the hawk with quivering wings, and he knew that in a second it would pounce down on the frightened thrush. He jumped to his feet, fixed a stone in his sling, and before the whirr of the stone shooting through the air was silent, the stricken hawk tumbled headlong in the grass.The thrush, shaking its wings, rose joyously in the air, and perching upon an elm-tree in sight of the children, he sang a song so sweet that they left the hawthorn shade and walked along together until they stood under the branches of the elm; and they listened and listened to the thrush’s song, and at last Nora said:“Oh, Connla! did you ever hear a song so sweet as this?”“No,” said Connla, “and I do believe sweeter music was never heard before.”“Ah,” said the thrush, “that’s because you never heard the nine little pipers playing. And now, Connla and Nora, you saved my life to-day.”“It was Nora saved it,” said Connla, “for she pointed you out to me, and also pointed out the hawk which was about to pounce on you.”“It was Connla saved you,” said Nora, “for he slew the hawk with his sling.”“I owe my life to both of you,” said the thrush. “You like my song, and you say you have never heard anything so sweet; but wait till you hear the nine little pipers playing.”“And when shall we hear them?” said the children.“Well,” said the thrush, “sit outside your door to-morrow evening, and wait and watch until the shadows have crept up the heather, and then, when the mountain top is gleaming like a golden spear, look at the line where the shadow on the heather meets the sunshine, and you shall see what you shall see.”And having said this, the thrush sang another song sweeter than the first, and then saying “good-bye,” he flew away into the woods.The children went home, and all night long they were dreaming of the thrush and the nine little pipers; and when the birds sang in the morning, they got up and went out into the meadow to watch the mountain.The sun was shining in a cloudless sky, and no shadows lay on the mountain, and all day long they watched and waited, and at last, when the birds were singing their farewell song to the evening star, the children saw the shadows marching from the glen, trooping up the mountain side and dimming the purple of the heather.And when the mountain top gleamed like a golden spear, they fixed their eyes on the line between the shadow and the sunshine.“Now,” said Connla, “the time has come.”“Oh, look! look!” said Nora, and as she spoke, just above the line of shadow a door opened out, and through its portals came a little piper dressed in green and gold. He stepped down, followed by another and another, until they were nine in all, and then the door slung back again. Down through the heather marched the pipers in single file, and all the time they played a music so sweet that the birds, who had gone to sleep in their nests, came out upon the branches to listen to them and then they crossed the meadow, and they went on and on until they disappeared in the leafy woods.While they were passing the children were spell-bound, and couldn’t speak, but when the music had died away in the woods, they said:“The thrush is right, that is the sweetest music that was ever heard in all the world.”And when the children went to bed that night the fairy music came to them in their dreams. But when the morning broke, and they looked out upon their mountain and could see no trace of the door above the heather, they asked each other whether they had really seen the little pipers, or only dreamt of them.That day they went out into the woods, and they sat beside a stream that pattered along beneath the trees, and through the leaves tossing in the breeze the sun flashed down upon the streamlet, and shadow and sunshine danced upon it. As the children watched the water sparkling where the sunlight fell, Nora said:“Oh, Connla, did you ever see anything so bright and clear and glancing as that?”“No,” said Connla, “I never did.”“That’s because you never saw the crystal hall of the fairy of the mountains,” said a voice above the heads of the children.And when they looked up, who should they see perched on a branch but the thrush.“And where is the crystal hall of the fairy?” said Connla.“Oh, it is where it always was, and where it always will be,” said the thrush. “And you can see it if you like.”“We would like to see it,” said the children.“Well, then,” said the thrush, “if you would, all you have to do is to follow the nine little pipers when they come down through the heather, and cross the meadow to-morrow evening.”And the thrush having said this, flew away.Connla and Nora went home, and that night they fell asleep talking of the thrush and the fairy and the crystal hall.All the next day they counted the minutes, until they saw the shadows thronging from the glen and scaling the mountain side. And, at last, they saw the door springing open, and the nine little pipers marching down.They waited until the pipers had crossed the meadow and were about to enter the wood. And then they followed them, the pipers marching on before them and playing all the time. It was not long until they had passed through the wood, and then, what should the children see rising up before them but another mountain, smaller than their own, but, like their own, clad more than half-way up with purple heather, and whose top was bare and sharp-pointed, and gleaming like a golden spear.Up through the heather climbed the pipers, up through the heather the children clambered after them, and the moment the pipers passed the heather a door opened and they marched in, the children following, and the door closed behind them.Connla and Nora were so dazzled by the light that hit their eyes, when they had crossed the threshold, that they had to shade them with their hands; but, after a moment or two, they became able to bear the splendour, and when they looked around they saw that they were in a noble hall, whose crystal roof was supported by two rows of crystal pillars rising from a crystal floor; and the walls were of crystal, and along the walls were crystal couches, with coverings and cushions of sapphire silk with silver tassels.Over the crystal floor the little pipers marched; over the crystal floor the children followed, and when a door at the end of the hall was opened to let the pipers pass, a crowd of colours came rushing in, and floor, and ceiling, and stately pillars, and glancing couches, and shining walls, were stained with a thousand dazzling hues.Out through the door the pipers marched; out through the door the children followed, and when they crossed the threshold they were treading on clouds of amber, of purple, and of gold.“Oh, Connla,” said Nora, “we have walked into the sunset!”And around and about them everywhere were soft, fleecy clouds, and over their heads was the glowing sky, and the stars were shining through it, as a lady’s eyes shine through a veil of gossamer. And the sky and stars seemed so near that Connla thought he could almost touch them with his hand.When they had gone some distance, the pipers disappeared, and when Connla and Nora came up to the spot where they had seen the last of them, they found themselves at the head of a ladder, all the steps of which were formed of purple and amber clouds that descended to what appeared to be a vast and shining plain, streaked with purple and gold. In the spaces between the streaks of gold and purple they saw soft, milk-white stars. And the children thought that the great plain, so far below them, also belonged to cloudland.They could not see the little pipers, but up the steps was borne by the cool, sweet air the fairy music; and lured on by it step by step they travelled down the fleecy stairway. When they were little more than half way down there came mingled with the music a sound almost as sweet––the sound of waters toying in the still air with pebbles on a shelving beach, and with the sound came the odorous brine of the ocean. And then the children knew that what they thought was a plain in the realms of cloudland was the sleeping sea unstirred by wind or tide, dreaming of the purple clouds and stars of the sunset sky above it.When Connla and Nora reached the strand they saw the nine little pipers marching out towards the sea, and they wondered where they were going to. And they could hardly believe their eyes when they saw them stepping out upon the level ocean as if they were walking upon the land; and away the nine little pipers marched, treading the golden line cast upon the waters by the setting sun. And as the music became fainter and fainter as the pipers passed into the glowing distance, the children began to wonder what was to become of themselves. Just at that very moment they saw coming towards them from the sinking sun a little white horse, with flowing mane and tail and golden hoofs. On the horse’s back was a little man dressed in shining green silk. When the horse galloped on to the strand the little man doffed his hat, and said to the children:“Would you like to follow the nine little pipers?” The children said, “yes.”“Well, then,” said the little man, “come up here behind me; you, Nora, first, and Connla after.”Connla helped up Nora, and then climbed on to the little steed himself; and as soon as they were properly seated the little man said “swish,” and away went the steed, galloping over the sea without wetting hair or hoof. But fast as he galloped the nine little pipers were always ahead of him, although they seemed to be going only at a walking pace. When at last he came up rather close to the hindmost of them the nine little pipers disappeared, but the children heard the music playing beneath the waters. The white steed pulled up suddenly, and wouldn’t move a step further.“Now,” said the little man to the children, “clasp me tight, Nora, and do you, Connla, cling on to Nora, and both of you shut your eyes.”The children did as they were bidden, and the little man cried:“Swish! swash!”And the steed went down and down until at last his feet struck the bottom.“Now open your eyes,” said the little man.And when the children did so they saw beneath the horse’s feet a golden strand, and above their heads the sea like a transparent cloud between them and the sky. And once more they heard the fairy music, and marching on the strand before them were the nine little pipers.“You must get off now,” said the little man, “I can go no farther with you.”The children scrambled down, and the little man cried “swish,” and himself and the steed shot up through the sea, and they saw him no more. Then they set out after the nine little pipers, and it wasn’t long until they saw rising up from the golden strand and pushing their heads up into the sea above, a mass of dark grey rocks. And as they were gazing at them they saw the rocks opening, and the nine little pipers disappearing through them.The children hurried on, and when they came up close to the rocks they saw sitting on a flat and polished stone a mermaid combing her golden hair, and singing a strange sweet song that brought the tears to their eyes, and by the mermaid’s side was a little sleek brown otter.When the mermaid saw them she flung her golden tresses back over her snow-white shoulders, and she beckoned the children to her. Her large eyes were full of sadness; but there was a look so tender upon her face that the children moved towards her without any fear.“Come to me, little one,” she said to Nora, “come and kiss me,” and in a second her arms were around the child. The mermaid kissed her again and again, as the tears rushed to her eyes, she said:“Oh, Nora, avourneen, your breath is as sweet as the wild rose that blooms in the green fields of Erin, and happy are you, my children, who have come so lately from the pleasant land. Oh, Connla! Connla! I get the scent of the dew of the Irish grasses and of the purple heather from your feet. And you both can soon return to Erin of the Streams, but I shall not see it till three hundred years have passed away, for I am Liban the Mermaid, daughter of a line of kings. But I may not keep you here. The Fairy Queen is waiting for you in her snow-white palace and her fragrant bowers. And now kiss me once more, Nora, and kiss me, Connla. May luck and joy go with you, and all gentleness be upon you both.”Then the children said good-bye to the mermaid, and the rocks opened for them and they passed through, and soon they found themselves in a meadow starred with flowers, and through the meadow sped a sunlit stream. They followed the stream until it led them into a garden of roses, and beyond the garden, standing on a gentle hill, was a palace white as snow. Before the palace was a crowd of fairy maidens pelting each other with rose-leaves. But when they saw the children they gave over their play, and came trooping towards them.“Our queen is waiting for you,” they said; and then they led the children to the palace door. The children entered, and after passing through a long corridor they found themselves in a crystal hall so like the one they had seen in the mountain of the golden spear that they thought it was the same. But on all the crystal couches fairies, dressed in silken robes of many colours, were sitting, and at the end of the hall, on a crystal throne, was seated the fairy queen, looking lovelier than the evening star. The queen descended from her throne to meet the children, and taking them by the hands, she led them up the shining steps. Then, sitting down, she made them sit beside her, Connla on her right hand and Nora on her left.Then she ordered the nine little pipers to come before her, and she said to them:“So far you have done your duty faithfully, and now play one more sweet air and your task is done.”And the little pipers played, and from the couches at the first sound of the music all the fairies rose, and forming partners, they danced over the crystal floor as lightly as the young leaves dancing in the wind.Listening to the fairy music, and watching the wavy motion of the dancing fairies, the children fell asleep. When they awoke next morning and rose from their silken beds they were no longer children. Nora was a graceful and stately maiden, and Connla a handsome and gallant youth. They looked at each other for a moment in surprise, and then Connla said:“Oh, Nora, how tall and beautiful you are!”“Oh, not so tall and handsome as you are, Connla,” said Nora, as she flung her white arms round his neck and kissed her brother’s lips.Then they drew back to get a better look of each other, and who should step between them but the fairy queen.“Oh, Nora, Nora,” said she, “I am not as high as your knee, and as for you, Connla, you look as straight and as tall as one of the round towers of Erin.”“And how did we grow so tall in one night?” said Connla.“In one night!” said the fairy queen. “One night, indeed! Why, you have been fast asleep, the two of you, for the last seven years!”“And where was the little mother all that time?” said Connla and Nora together.“Oh, the little mother was all right. She knew where you were; but she is expecting you to-day, and so you must go off to see her, although I would like to keep you––if I had my way––all to myself here in the fairyland under the sea. And you will see her to-day; but before you go here is a necklace for you, Nora; it is formed out of the drops of the ocean spray, sparkling in the sunshine. They were caught by my fairy nymph, for you, as they skimmed the sunlit billows under the shape of sea-birds, and no queen or princess in the world can match their lustre with the diamonds won with toil from the caves of earth. As for you, Connla, see here’s a helmet of shining gold fit for a king of Erin––and a king of Erin you will be yet; and here’s a spear that will pierce any shield, and here’s a shield that no spear can pierce and no sword can cleave as long as you fasten your warrior cloak with this brooch of gold.”And as she spoke she flung round Connla’s shoulders a flowing mantle of yellow silk, and pinned it at his neck with a red gold brooch.“And now, my children, you must go away from me. You, Nora, will be a warrior’s bride in Erin of the Streams. And you, Connla, will be king yet over the loveliest province in all the land of Erin; but you will have to fight for your crown, and days of battle are before you. They will not come for a long time after you have left the fairyland under the sea, and until they come lay aside your helmet, shield, and spear, and warrior’s cloak and golden brooch. But when the time comes when you will be called to battle, enter not upon it without the golden brooch I give you fastened in your cloak, for if you do harm will come to you. Now, kiss me, children; your little mother is waiting for you at the foot of the golden spear, but do not forget to say good-bye to Liban the Mermaid, exiled from the land she loves, and pining in sadness beneath the sea.”Connla and Nora kissed the fairy queen, and Connla, wearing his golden helmet and silken cloak, and carrying his shield and spear, led Nora with him. They passed from the palace through the garden of roses, through the flowery meadow, through the dark grey rocks, until they reached the golden strand; and there, sitting and singing the strange, sweet song, was Liban the Mermaid.“And so you are going up to Erin,” she said, “up through the covering waters. Kiss me, children, once again; and when you are in Erin of the Streams, sometimes think of the exile from Erin beneath the sea.”And the children kissed the mermaid, and with sad hearts, bidding her good-bye, they walked along the golden strand. When they had gone what seemed to them a long way, they began to feel weary; and just then they saw coming towards them a little man in a red jacket leading a coal-black steed.When they met the little man, he said: “Connla, put Nora up on this steed; then jump up before her.”Connla did as he was told, and when both of them were mounted––“Now, Connla,” said the little man, “catch the bridle in your hands, and you, Nora, clasp Connla round the waist, and close your eyes.”They did as they were bidden, and then the little man said, “Swash, swish!” and the steed shot up from the strand like a lark from the grass, and pierced the covering sea, and went bounding on over the level waters; and when his hoofs struck the hard ground, Connla and Nora opened their eyes, and they saw that they were galloping towards a shady wood.On went the steed, and soon he was galloping beneath the branches that almost touched Connla’s head. And on they went until they had passed through the wood, and then they saw rising up before them the “Golden Spear.”“Oh, Connla,” said Nora, “we are at home at last.”“Yes,” said Connla, “but where is the little house under the hill?”And no little house was there; but in its stead was standing a lime-white mansion.“What can this mean?” said Nora.But before Connla could reply, the steed had galloped up to the door of the mansion, and, in the twinkling of an eye, Connla and Nora were standing on the ground outside the door, and the steed had vanished.Before they could recover from their surprise the little mother came rushing out to them, and flung her arms around their necks, and kissed them both again and again.“Oh, children! children! You are welcome home to me; for though I knew it was all for the best, my heart was lonely without you.”And Connla and Nora caught up the little mother in their arms, and they carried her into the hall and set her down on the floor.“Oh, Nora!” said the little mother, “you are a head over me; and as for you, Connla, you look almost as tall as one of the round towers of Erin.”“That’s what the fairy queen said, mother,” said Nora.“Blessings on the fairy queen,” said the little mother. “Turn round, Connla, till I look at you.”Connla turned round, and the little mother said:“Oh, Connla, with your golden helmet and your spear, and your glancing shield, and your silken cloak, you look like a king. But take them off, my boy, beautiful as they are. Your little mother would like to see you, her own brave boy, without any fairy finery.”And Connla laid aside his spear and shield, and took off his golden helmet and his silken cloak. Then he caught the little mother and kissed her, and lifted her up until she was as high as his head. And said he:“Don’t you know, little mother, I’d rather have you than all the world.”And that night, when they were sitting down by the fire together, you may be sure that in the whole world no people were half as happy as Nora, Connla, and the little mother.","['follow', 'encounter', 'duergar', 'specie', 'mischievous', 'take', 'place', 'simonside', 'hill', 'mountainous', 'district', 'rothbury',

2245,irish,The Fisherman's Son and the Gruagach of Tricks,"There was an old fisherman once in Erin who had a wife and one son.The old fisherman used to go about with a fishing-rod and tackle to the rivers and lochs and every place where fish resort, and he was killing salmon and other fish to keep the life in himself and his wife and son.The son was not so keen nor so wise as another, and the father was instructing him every day in fishing, so that if himself should be taken from the world, the son would be able to support the old mother and get his own living.One day when the father and son were fishing in a river near the sea, they looked out over the water and saw a small dark speck on the waves. It grew larger and larger, till they saw a boat, and when the boat drew near they saw a man sitting in the stern of it.There was a nice beach near the place where they were fishing. The man brought the boat straight to the beach, and stepping out drew it up on the sand.They saw then that the stranger was a man of high degree (duine uasal).After he had put the boat high on the sand, he came to where the two were at work, and said: “Old fisherman, you’d better let this son of yours with me for a year and a day, and I will make a very wise man of him. I am the Gruagach na g-cleasan (Gruagach of tricks), and I’ll bind myself to be here with your son this day year.”“I can’t let him go,” said the old fisherman, “till he gets his mother’s advice.”“Whatever goes as far as women I’ll have nothing to do with,” said the Gruagach. “You had better give him to me now, and let the mother alone.”They talked till at last the fisherman promised to let his son go for the year and a day. Then the Gruagach gave his word to have the boy there at the seashore that day year.The Gruagach and the boy went into the boat and sailed away.When the year and a day were over, the old fisherman went to the same place where he had parted with his son and the Gruagach, and stood looking over the sea, thinking would he see his son that day.At last he saw a black spot on the water, then a boat. When it was near he saw two men sitting in the stern of the boat. When it touched land, the two, who were duine uasal in appearance, jumped out, and one of them pulled the boat to the top of the strand. Then that one, followed by the other, came to where the old fisherman was waiting, and asked: “What trouble is on you now, my good man?”“I had a son that wasn’t so keen nor so wise as another, and myself and this son were here fishing, and a stranger came, like yourself to-day, and asked would I let my son with him for a year and a day. I let the son go, and the man promised to be here with him to-day, and that’s why I am waiting at this place now.” “Well,” said the Gruagach, “am I your son?”“You are not,” said the fisherman.“Is this man here your son?”“I don’t know him,” said the fisherman.“Well, then, he is all you will have in place of your son,” said the Gruagach.The old man looked again, and knew his son. He caught hold of him and welcomed him home.“Now,” said the Gruagach, “isn’t he a better man than he was a year ago?”“Oh, he’s nearly a smart man now!” said the old fisherman.“Well,” said the Gruagach, “will you let him with me for another year and a day?”“I will not,” said the old man; “I want him myself.”The Gruagach then begged and craved till the fisherman promised to let the son with him for a year and a day again. But the old man forgot to take his word of the Gruagach to bring back the son at the end of the time; and when the Gruagach and the boy were in the boat, and had pushed out to sea, the Gruagach shouted to the old man: “I kept my promise to bring back your son to-day. I haven’t given you my word at all now. I’ll not bring him back, and you’ll never see him again.”The fisherman went home with a heavy and sorrowful heart, and the old woman scolded him all that night till next morning for letting her son go with the Gruagach a second time.Then himself and the old woman were lamenting a quarter of a year; and when another quarter had passed, he said to her: “I’ll leave you here now, and I’ll be walking on myself till I wear my legs off up to my knees, and from my knees to my waist, till I find where is my son.” So away went the old man walking, and he used to spend but one night in a house, and not two nights in any house, till his feet were all in blisters. One evening late he came to a hut where there was an old woman sitting at a fire.“Poor man!” said she, when she laid eyes on him, “it’s a great distress you are in, to be so disfigured with wounds and sores. What is the trouble that’s on you?”“I had a son,” said the old man, “and the Gruagach na g-cleasan came on a day and took him from me.”“Oh, poor man!” said she. “I have a son with that same Gruagach these twelve years, and I have never been able to get him back or get sight of him, and I’m in dread you’ll not be able to get your son either. But to-morrow, in the morning, I’ll tell you all I know, and show you the road you must go to find the house of the Gruagach na g-cleasan.”Next morning she showed the old fisherman the road. He was to come to the place by evening.When he came and entered the house, the Gruagach shook hands with him, and said: “You are welcome, old fisherman. It was I that put this journey on you, and made you come here looking for your son.”“It was no one else but you,” said the fisherman.“Well,” said the Gruagach, “you won’t see your son to-day. At noon to-morrow I’ll put a whistle in my mouth and call together all the birds in my place, and they’ll come. Among others will be twelve doves. I’ll put my hand in my pocket, this way, and take out wheat and throw it before them on the ground. The doves will eat the wheat, and you must pick your son out of the twelve. If you find him, you’ll have him; if you don’t, you’ll never get him again.”After the Gruagach had said these words the old man ate his supper and went to bed.In the dead of night the old fisherman’s son came. “Oh, father!” said he, “it would be hard for you to pick me out among the twelve doves, if you had to do it alone; but I’ll tell you. When the Gruagach calls us in, and we go to pick up the wheat, I’ll make a ring around the others, walking for myself; and as I go I’ll give some of them a tip of my bill, and I’ll lift my wings when I’m striking them. There was a spot under one of my arms when I left home, and you’ll see that spot under my wing when I raise it to-morrow. Don’t miss the bird that I’ll be, and don’t let your eyes off it; if you do, you’ll lose me forever.”Next morning the old man rose, had his breakfast, and kept thinking of what his son had told him.At midday the Gruagach took his whistle and blew. Birds came to him from every part, and among others the twelve doves.He took wheat from his pocket, threw it to the doves, and said to the father: “Now pick out your son from the twelve.”The old man was watching, and soon he saw one of the doves walking around the other eleven and hitting some of them a clip of its bill, and then it raised its wings, and the old man saw the spot. The bird let its wings down again, and went to eating with the rest.The father never let his eyes off the bird. After a while he said to the Gruagach: “I’ll have that bird there for my son.” “Well,” said the Gruagach, “that is your son. I can’t blame you for having him; but I blame your instructor for the information he gave you, and I give him my curse.”So the old fisherman got his son back in his proper shape, and away they went, father and son, from the house of the Gruagach. The old man felt stronger now, and they never stopped travelling a day till they came home.The old mother was very glad to see her son, and see him such a wise, smart man.After coming home they had no means but the fishing; they were as poor as ever before.At this time it was given out at every crossroad in Erin, and in all public places in the kingdom, that there were to be great horse-races. Now, when the day came, the old fisherman’s son said:“Come away with me, father, to the races.”The old man went with him, and when they were near the race-course, the son said:“Stop here till I tell you this: I’ll make myself into the best horse that’s here to-day, and do you take me to the place where the races are to be, and when you take me in, I’ll open my mouth, trying to kill and eat every man that’ll be near me, I’ll have such life and swiftness; and do you find a rider for me that’ll ride me, and don’t let me go till the other horses are far ahead on the course. Then let me go. I’ll come up to them, and I’ll run ahead of them and win the race. After that every rich man there will want to buy me of you; but don’t you sell me to any man for less than five hundred pounds; and be sure you get that price for me. And when you have the gold, and you are giving me up, take the bit out of my mouth, and don’t sell the bridle for any money. Then come to this spot, shake the bridle, and I’ll be here in my own form before you.”The son made himself a horse, and the old fisherman took him to the race. He reared and snorted, trying to take the head off every man that came near him.The old man shouted for a rider. A rider came; he mounted the horse and held him in. The old man didn’t let him start till the other horses were well ahead on the course; then he let him go.The new horse caught up with the others and shot past them. So they had not gone half way when he was in at the winning-post.When the race was ended, there was a great noise over the strange horse. Men crowded around the old fisherman from every corner of the field, asking what would he take for the horse.“Five hundred pounds,” said he.“Here ’tis for you,” said the next man to him.In a moment the horse was sold, and the money in the old man’s pocket. Then he pulled the bridle off the horse’s head, and made his way out of the place as fast as ever he could.It was not long till he was at the spot where the son had told him what to do. The minute he came, he shook the bridle, and the son was there before him in his own shape and features.Oh, but the old fisherman was glad when he had his son with him again, and the money in his pocket!The two went home together. They had money enough now to live, and quit the fishing. They had plenty to eat and drink, and they spent their lives in ease and comfort till the next year, when it was given out at all the cross-roads in Erin, and every public place in the kingdom, that there was to be a great hunting with hounds, in the same place where the races had been the year before.When the day came, the fisherman’s son said: “Come, father, let us go away to this hunting.”“Ah!” said the old man, “what do we want to go for? Haven’t we plenty to eat at home, with money enough and to spare? What do we care for hunting with hounds?”“Oh! they’ll give us more money,” said the son, “if we go.”The fisherman listened to his son, and away they went. When the two came to the spot where the son had made a horse of himself the year before, he stopped, and said to the father: “I’ll make a hound of myself to-day, and when you bring me in sight of the game, you’ll see me wild with jumping and trying to get away; but do you hold me fast till the right time comes, then let go. I’ll sweep ahead of every hound in the field, catch the game, and win the prize for you.“When the hunt is over, so many men will come to buy me that they’ll put you in a maze; but be sure you get three hundred pounds for me, and when you have the money, and are giving me up, don’t forget to keep my rope. Come to this place, shake the rope, and I’ll be here before you, as I am now. If you don’t keep the rope, you’ll go home without me.”The son made a hound of himself, and the old father took him to the hunting-ground.When the hunt began, the hound was springing and jumping like mad; but the father held him till the others were far out in the field. Then he let him loose, and away went the son.Soon he was up with the pack, then in front of the pack, and never stopped till he caught the game and won the prize.When the hunt was over, and the dogs and game brought in, all the people crowded around the old fisherman, saying: “What do you want of that hound? Better sell him; he’s no good to you.”They put the old man in a maze, there were so many of them, and they pressed him so hard.He said at last: “I’ll sell the hound; and three hundred pounds is the price I want for him.”“Here ’tis for you,” said a stranger, putting the money into his hand.The old man took the money and gave up the dog, without taking off the rope. He forgot his son’s warning.That minute the Gruagach na g-cleasan called out: “I’ll take the worth of my money out of your son now;” and away he went with the hound.The old man walked home alone that night, and it is a heavy heart he had in him when he came to the old woman without the son. And the two were lamenting their lot till morning.Still and all, they were better off than the first time they lost their son, as they had plenty of everything, and could live at their ease.The Gruagach went away home, and put the fisherman’s son in a cave of concealment that he had, bound him hand and foot, and tied hard knots on his neck up to the chin. From above there fell on him drops of poison, and every drop that fell went from the skin to the flesh, from the flesh to the bone, from the bone to the marrow, and he sat there under the poison drops, without meat, drink, or rest.In the Gruagach’s house was a servant-maid, and the fisherman’s son had been kind to her the time he was in the place before.On a day when the Gruagach and his eleven sons were out hunting, the maid was going with a tub of dirty water to throw it into the river that ran by the side of the house. She went through the cave of concealment where the fisherman’s son was bound, and he asked of her the wetting of his mouth from the tub.“Oh! the Gruagach would take the life of me,” said she, “when he comes home, if I gave you as much as one drop.”“Well,” said he, “when I was in this house before, and when I had power in my hands, it’s good and kind I was to you; and when I get out of this confinement I’ll do you a turn, if you give me the wetting of my mouth now.”The maid put the tub near his lips.“Oh! I can’t stoop to drink unless you untie one knot from my throat,” said he.Then she put the tub down, stooped to him, and loosed one knot from his throat. When she loosed the one knot he made an eel of himself, and dropped into the tub. There he began shaking the water, till he put some of it on the ground, and when he had the place about him wet, he sprang from the tub, and slipped along out under the door. The maid caught him; but could not hold him, he was so slippery. He made his way from the door to the river, which ran near the side of the house.When the Gruagach na g-cleasan came home in the evening with his eleven sons, they went to take a look at the fisherman’s son; but he was not to be seen. Then the Gruagach called the maid, and taking his sword, said: “I’ll take the head off you if you don’t tell me this minute what happened while I was gone.”“Oh!” said the maid, “he begged so hard for a drop of dirty water to wet his mouth that I hadn’t the heart to refuse, for ’tis good he was to me and kind each time he saw me when he was here in the house before. When the water touched his mouth, he made an eel of himself, spilled water out of the tub, and slipped along over the wet place to the river outside. I caught him to bring him back, but I couldn’t hold him; in spite of all I could do, he made away.”The Gruagach dropped his sword, and went to the water side with his sons.The sons made eleven eels of themselves, and the Gruagach their father was the twelfth. They went around in the water, searching in every place, and there was not a stone in the river that they passed without looking under and around it for the old fisherman’s son.And when he knew that they were after him, he made himself into a salmon; and when they knew he was a salmon, the sons made eleven otters of themselves, and the Gruagach made himself the twelfth.When the fisherman’s son found that twelve otters were after him, he was weak with hunger, and when they had come near, he made himself a whale. But the eleven brothers and their father made twelve cannon whales of themselves, for they had all gone out of the river, and were in the sea now.When they were coming near him, the fisherman’s son was weak from pursuit and hunger, so he jumped up out of the water, and made a swallow of himself; but the Gruagach and his sons became twelve hawks, and chased the swallow through the air; and as they whirled round and darted, they pressed him hard, till all of them came near the castle of the king of Erin.Now the king had made a summer-house for his daughter; and where should she be at this time but sitting on the top of the summer-house.The old fisherman’s son dropped down till he was near her; then he fell into her lap in the form of a ring. The daughter of the king of Erin took up the ring, looked at it, and put it on her finger. The ring took her fancy, and she was glad.When the Gruagach and his sons saw this, they let themselves down at the king’s castle, having the form of the finest men that could be seen in the kingdom.When the king’s daughter had the ring on her finger she looked at it and liked it. Then the ring spoke, and said: “My life is in your hands now; don’t part from the ring, and don’t let it go to any man, and you’ll give me a long life.”The Gruagach na g-cleasan and his eleven sons went into the king’s castle and played on every instrument known to man, and they showed every sport that could be shown before a king. This they did for three days and three nights. When that time was over, and they were going away, the king spoke up and asked:“What is the reward that you would like, and what would be pleasing to you from me?”“We want neither gold nor silver,” said the Gruagach; “all the reward we ask of you is the ring that I lost on a time, and which is now on your daughter’s finger.” “If my daughter has the ring that you lost, it shall be given to you,” said the king.Now the ring spoke to the king’s daughter and said: “Don’t part with me for anything till you send your trusted man for three gallons of strong spirits and a gallon of wheat; put the spirits and the wheat together in an open barrel before the fire. When your father says you must give up the ring, do you answer back that you have never left the summer-house, that you have nothing on your hand but what is your own and paid for. Your father will say then that you must part with me, and give me up to the stranger. When he forces you in this way, and you can keep me no longer, then throw me into the fire; and you’ll see great sport and strange things.”The king’s daughter sent for the spirits and the wheat, had them mixed together, and put in an open barrel before the fire.The king called the daughter in, and asked: “Have you the ring which this stranger lost?”“I have a ring,” said she, “but it’s my own, and I’ll not part with it. I’ll not give it to him nor to any man.”“You must,” said the king, “for my word is pledged, and you must part with the ring!”When she heard this, she slipped the ring from her finger and threw it into the fire.That moment the eleven brothers made eleven pairs of tongs of themselves; their father, the old Gruagach, was the twelfth pair.The twelve jumped into the fire to know in what spark of it would they find the old fisherman’s son; and they were a long time working and searching through the fire, when out flew a spark, and into the barrel. The twelve made themselves men, turned over the barrel, and spilled the wheat on the floor. Then in a twinkling they were twelve cocks strutting around.They fell to and picked away at the wheat to know which one would find the fisherman’s son. Soon one dropped on one side, and a second on the opposite side, until all twelve were lying drunk from the wheat.Then the old fisherman’s son made a fox of himself, and the first cock he came to was the old Gruagach na g-cleasan himself. He took the head off the Gruagach with one bite, and the heads off the eleven brothers with eleven other bites.When the twelve were dead, the old fisherman’s son made himself the finest-looking man in Erin, and began to give music and sport to the king; and he entertained him five times better than had the Gruagach and his eleven sons.Then the king’s daughter fell in love with him, and she set her mind on him to that degree that there was no life for her without him.When the king saw the straits that his daughter was in, he ordered the marriage without delay.The wedding lasted for nine days and nine nights, and the ninth night was the best of all.When the wedding was over, the king felt he was losing his strength, so he took the crown off his own head, and put it on the head of the old fisherman’s son, and made him king of Erin in place of himself.The young couple were the luck, and we the stepping-stones. The presents we got at the marriage were stockings of buttermilk and shoes of paper, and these were worn to the soles of our feet when we got home from the wedding.","['portal', 'church', 'apostle',

2328,irish,The Cleverness of Mortals,"If you live in the city of New York, or if you have ever been in the city of New York for any long time, you know how disheartening, how terrible, and how altogether unreasonable the climate can be at times. But you also know how heavenly it can be on an autumn day, when the sky and the air and the water are all in a good humor. To see and to feel the best of it, you must be down in the Narrows, or somewhere near there. The fierce heat has gone out of the air, but there is a gentle warmth left in it. All the shores near you are turning from green to brown and yellow, with here and there a dash of red. The sun makes every sail in the bay a gleaming spot of white. Far up the bay you see just an end of the city, with the tall buildings standing so close that it looks like one great castle, built all over a hill that slopes steeply down to the water on both sides. The Bridge looks like a spider’s web, spun across to the other shore. Beyond it all the hills look purple, through the thin mist. If, instead of having seen all this often, you saw it for the first time—if you were coming from a far country, where you had always been poor—if you had toiled all your life to pay your rent, never expecting to do more—then perhaps you would look, more than anything else, at the giant woman standing before you and holding her torch high into the sky to light the world.It was on such a day as this that the O’Briens and the Sullivans saw New York first. It was on the same day that the fairies who had left the rath and followed them saw it too. The O’Briens and the Sullivans had left their old home and gone to Queenstown, and the fairies had followed them. Cork and Queenstown had rather alarmed the fairies. They did not like the look of a city. It looked cold and stony and uncomfortable. It did not look like a good place to dance out of doors at night. They almost wished that they had stayed at home and let the O’Briens and the Sullivans go where they liked without them. Some of them even wanted to go back, but Naggeneen laughed at them, and fairies can stand being laughed at even less than human beings. But they all hoped that when the O’Briens and the Sullivans got wherever they were going, it would not prove to be in a city.Then the O’Briens and the Sullivans went on board a ship and were stowed away in a place forward, with many other people, which the fairies did not think roomy or airy or pleasant in any way. But they were not obliged to stay in it. They found better places on the ship. Nobody could see them, so they went where they liked. They went out on the bow, where the lookout stood, and watched with him for sails and for tiny puffs of smoke by day and for little glimmers of light by night. They ran about the bridge and swarmed up the rigging. They even danced on the deck, as if they were in a field at home; and the deck was dewy at night, just like the field. They fluttered and whirled in circles around the red light on the one side of the ship and the green light on the other side, and they reminded them of the rubies and the emeralds that had helped to light their own rath.One day they saw swimming in the water beside the ship an ugly creature, like a man, with a red nose, tangled green hair, green teeth, and fingers with webs between them, like a duck’s foot. There was another creature, like a woman, very beautiful, but with green hair, like the man. These were merrows—sea fairies.“Where are you bound in that ship?” the merrows called to them.“Where would we be bound at all,” the King answered, “but to the States, where the ship’s bound?”“And what are ye goin’ there for?” the merrows asked again.“Sure,” said Naggeneen, “it’s followin’ the O’Briens and the Sullivans we are, and it’s the long way they’re takin’ us.”“Could you tell us what the States is like at all?” asked the King. “Is it like Cork?”“There’s parts of them,” said the man merrow, “that’s more like Cork than Cork itself, and there’s other parts of them that’s no more like Cork than the sea here is like Cork Harbor.”“But are there no places there,” the King asked again, “like the country parts of Ireland, with the fields and the bogs and all?”“I can’t tell you that,” the merrow answered. “We’ve never been far on the land. Deep down under the sea it’s the same way it is under the sea about Ireland. There’s the land at the bottom, with the sand all fine and firm, like a floor, and there’s the water above, like a green sky, and there are the shells and the sea-flowers, and there are the weeds that wave around you and over you, like red and green and purple curtains to your house, and it’s all as cool and as neat as any of the sea-places around Ireland. And if you like to go up to get the warmth of the sun or the light of the stars, there’s white sand where you can lie at your ease, and there’s great rocks where you can sit and look out over the sea and get the fresh breeze. And that’s all we know of it; we’ve not been away from the sea.”And after a week of voyaging through the sea—after going on and on for so long and so far that both fairies and mortals began to think that they must soon fall over the edge of the earth—the ship suddenly stood up straight, instead of rolling and pitching about, and a little later they saw the giant woman before them, holding up her torch, and beyond her they saw the city. And then it was only a bit of a while longer till they came close to the city.“Look at it!” cried the King to all the fairies, who were crowded at the bow; “it’s like the country, after all! Look at all the grass and the trees! But it has an iron chain all around it. I don’t like the look of that.” All fairies hate iron. They more than hate it; they simply cannot endure it. To touch any iron at all would hurt a fairy more than it would hurt you to touch it when it was red hot.“But it’s only a small place, anyway,” said Naggeneen. “Look at the houses beyond there! There was nothing like them in Cork! And do you mind them strings of coaches, running along up in the air?”“I was takin’ note of them,” said the King; “sure it’s the strange country!”The fairies all followed the O’Briens and the Sullivans. They were resolved not to lose sight of their only friends, in a land like this. They found that the O’Briens and the Sullivans were quickly taken to a big round house, in the very bit of a place like the country that they had first seen. The fairies did not like the inside of the big round house, so the King left a few to watch the O’Briens and the Sullivans, and to bring word if they made any important move, and the rest went out and found pleasanter places on the grass and under the trees. They had managed to get into the Battery Park without touching any of the horrible iron chains that were around it. They would have been a very sorry-looking company, if anybody could have seen them.“I don’t like it at all,” the King said, “and nothing would please me better than to be at home again. If they’re going to live in that big round house, I dunno what we’ll do. We want to be near to them, and yet this is no place for us. We could stand it a little while, maybe. The grass is fine and smooth for dancing, but these lights, like suns, that they have all around on the tops of the poles, are terrible. Do they want no night at all here? And then what a noise there is! It’s nothing but rattle and roar all day, and then the boats do be screeching around all night.”“Have no fear,” said the Queen. “The O’Briens would never live in a place like this. They’ll soon be out of it, and then we’ll follow them and find a better place near where they go.”It proved that the Queen was right. Before long there came an alarm from those who had been left to watch, that the O’Briens and the Sullivans were coming out. In a moment more they came, and the whole tribe followed them. Old Mrs. O’Brien, who never forgot anything that was worth remembering, had not forgotten to write to some old friends who had come to America years before, that she and her son and his wife and their neighbors were coming. These old friends had found tenements for them, and soon they were in new homes. There was enough of Mrs. O’Brien’s money to keep them for a little while, and they hoped that before it was gone, John and Peter would find work and would be getting more money.The fairies followed them, filled with more and more wonder. For miles they followed, and then for more miles. It was not that the distance troubled them. They could have gone a hundred times as far without thinking of being tired. But they could scarcely believe their eyes when they saw these never-ending stone roads and these never-ending rows of stone and brick houses, all built so that they touched one another. They could not understand how people could live so close together, nor why they should want to do it, if they could. Perhaps you have never thought of it, but it is really true that the ways of mortals are just as wonderful to fairies as the ways of fairies are to mortals.Indeed, the place where they found themselves at last was not a pleasant one for fairies. It was two places, in fact, but they were so much alike that there was nothing to choose between them. A tenement had been found for the O’Briens, up many flights of stairs, in a house with many other tenements. There was barely enough room in it for them to live, though it was better, in that respect, than their old cabin in Ireland. The stairs and the passage were far from clean, and they led down to a street that was just as far from clean.It was hard all over with square stones, which had sunk, in places, and made hollows, which were filled with muddy water. Lean cats scuttled about here and there, and ran away, if anybody came near them, as if they expected to have stones thrown at them, and then, when the danger seemed past, they rummaged in the ash-barrels for scraps of meat or fish or bread. The people who lived in the houses sat on the doorsteps and on the curb-stones, and chattered and laughed and quarrelled and slept. The sun shone into the street, but it could not shine between the houses. A breeze blew up from the East River, which was not far away, but the air was none too fresh, for all that. The place that had been found for the Sullivans was in another street, not far away. It was much the same, as I have said, but it was even smaller, for there were only two of the Sullivans, and they could get on with less space.The fairies were fairly terrified at all this. And was it any wonder? The poor little Good People! They had been used to a beautiful, bright hall, to green, fresh grass to dance on in the quiet, misty moonlight, and to cool shade for the day. What could they do in such a place as this? They remembered how the King of All Ireland had told them that they did not know whether the place where they were going was a place fit for them to live in.The first thing that the King did was to send some of the fairies in all directions to see if they could spy out any place where the whole tribe could live in a decent and comfortable manner. The street, he was sure, would never do. Of course, if the Fairy King wanted a rock or a hill to open and let him into it, it would open, and he could live in it, if he chose, just as he used to in his own old rath. And no mortal who might happen to be about would know that anything unusual was happening. And just so the street would open for him, if he wanted it to. But before he had decided to try it he saw a place where some men had opened it, and that was quite enough for him. If you have ever seen a New York street opened, you know what it was like; if you have not, it is of no use to try to tell you.But the messengers whom the King had sent in all directions were scarcely gone when those who had started toward the west were back with joyful news. “We have found a beautiful place,” they said. “It’s only a bit of a way from here, and if we live there we’ll not be far from the O’Briens. Ye never saw grass smoother in your life, though it’s not quite so green, maybe, as it is at home. And then there’s tall trees of all kinds, and there’s bushes that’ll have flowers on them, belike, in the right time of the year. And there’s smooth roads and walks, and there’s hills and great rocks, that we could live inside of as easy as in a rath itself. It’s a much quieter place than here, too, and the air is better, though it’s so near. It’s not wide toward the west, but off to the south it reaches as far as we can see, like a forest.”The King left a guard to watch, lest the O’Briens should like the place as little as himself and should leave it and be lost, and then he hurried with the rest to see the new country that had been discovered. If you know New York very well indeed, you have guessed already that it was the north end of Central Park which the fairies had found. But you may know New York pretty well and not know, as a good many people who live in it do not, that there is any north end to Central Park, still less that it is far prettier than the south end.After all the distressing streets and houses that he had seen, the King was delighted with it. He found a big rock, which was the base of a hill, and at the top of it stood a queer little square stone house. Back in this hill, he declared, behind the rock and under the stone house, would be as pleasant a place to live as ever the rath was. He made the rock open, and he and all the fairies with him went in, although the policemen and the men and women in carriages and on horses and on bicycles and on foot who were all about, did not see that the rock looked at all different.“A fine place for us it will make,” said the King; “we couldn’t be asking for a better. Get to work now, all of you. Hollow out the inside of the hill, only leave pillars to hold up the roof, and go and find gold for the floor and silver for the walls, and you can have every other pillar gold and every other one silver, after you get the rest done, and take down the rock that you left. And then find diamonds and rubies and emeralds to light it with.”No, I am not going to explain to you how the fairies did all this. I shall not tell you how they got the rock out nor what they did with it after they got it out. I will tell you all that there is any need of your knowing about it, and that is that in a very short time it was all done; that the new fairy palace was as much larger and finer and better than any fairy palace in Ireland ever was as we Americans intend that everything here shall be larger and finer and better than anything anywhere else. And it was all done before the most of the messengers who had been sent in other directions got back to tell what they had found.These fairies went straight to where the O’Briens lived, and there the fairies who had been left on guard told them where to find the King, and asked them to say to him that they were tired of their duty and they wished that he could send somebody else to take their places.The fairies were not much surprised when they found the King and all the tribe settled in a new palace, as comfortably as if they had never moved. The building of a palace in a night is no more to a fairy than it is to a New York man to come back after he has been out of town for a month and find a house twenty stories high in a place where there was a hole in the ground when he went away.“What’s the use at all to be tellin’ Your Majesty what we’ve found in the places we’ve been,” said one of the first who came back, “and you livin’ this minute in the finest palace that was ever dug out of a hill?”“You may tell us all the same,” said the King.“Well and good,” said the fairy. “It’s to the south I’ve been. First there’s all this island that we’re on, down to the place with the grass and the iron chain around it. Then there’s the bay, with the ships. Then there’s another island, with hills and trees, and then there’s the sea, and a long shore, all sand, and hundreds of houses, big and little, where people live. And that’s all.”Another fairy said: “I went farther to the west than this, but not much farther till I came to a great river. Of course I couldn’t be crossin’ the runnin’ water, so I went round the mouth of it and then kept on. The country was all flat for a good way, and bars of iron everywhere, laid two and two, so many of them that I didn’t dare rest anywhere, and there were towns and plenty of people, and then at long last I came to hills.”I suppose you know, without my telling you, that fairies cannot bear to cross running water, any more than they can bear to touch iron, and that was why this fairy had to go around the mouth of the Hudson River instead of going across it.Then came another fairy, who had been to the north, and he said: “It beats everything, the lovely country I’ve seen. Never a better did I see anywhere. Hills and woods and mountains, and the trees all yellow and red and green and brown. I went up the big river on this side for a long way, and then I saw great mountains on the other side. So beautiful they looked, I wanted to go to them, only, sure, I couldn’t cross the river. So I went round the head of it and came down back to the mountains. And there I found that they were full of fairies already. But they seemed to be Dutch, and it’s little English they could talk, let alone Irish. Still we got along, and they gave me some mighty fine drink that they had. And they said that we could come there, the whole tribe, and welcome kindly, and I’ld say it was a good place to go, only it’s farther off than this from them we want to be near.”“We’ll stay where we are,” said the King. “It’s as well that we know what’s all around us, but here we’ll be more to ourselves, as many people as there are, for I’m thinkin’ there’s no fairies but us here.”Then slowly out of the crowd of fairies one came forward and said: “Your Majesty, could I be saying something that’s breakin’ my heart? It’s hard for me to say and it’ll maybe be harder for you to hear; but it’s on my mind and I can’t get it off my mind. Will you forgive me if I say it?”And the King answered: “It’s much that’s bad and a little that’s good we’ve heard since we left our own home. But it’s best that we know all there is to know, bad or good. Say what you have to say.”“It’s not far I’ve been,” said the fairy; “only around here in the city that’s all about us; but many things I’ve seen, and wonderful things. Ah, Your Majesty, don’t blame me for what I’m saying, but what’s to become of us all and of you yourself, I dunno. We know all about magic; we’ve known all about it for years—aye, for ages. And we thought that made us better than mortals. We thought they could never do the things we could do; maybe they never can. But oh, Your Majesty, they’re doing things as good as we can do, or better. You wouldn’t believe what the mortals in this country do, if you wasn’t after seein’ it. They do things as wonderful as we ourselves, and it’s iron, iron, iron everywhere. We can do nothing with iron—we can’t touch it—and what will we do at all to be ahead of them, or even up with them?”“What’s all this they do?” said the King.“You saw yourself,” the fairy said, “the coaches that went along up in the air. They go on bridges, miles long, built of iron. And they run on bars of iron. You saw for yourself that they had no horses, and the coach in front that pulls them is all made of iron, and men ride in them, as if it was no harm at all to touch iron. And that’s not all. There are other coaches that go in the streets without horses. They have no iron coach in front to pull them. They go in different ways. Sometimes there’s an iron rope, that’s all the time moving and moving along under the street, and there’s a gripping iron under the coach that takes hold on it, and so it’s pulled along. And sometimes there’s only a little string—not iron, I think, but some other metal—and something just reaches down from the coach and touches it, and that makes it go. I dunno how it is, but it makes it go. And sometimes there’s fire comes out of it.”Then another fairy came out of the crowd and stood before the King. “Your Majesty,” he said, “I can tell you more than that. I have been about the city, too, and I went into some of the houses. I saw a man talking to a little box on the wall. I came close and I heard that the box was talking to him too. I thought there was a fairy inside it, but I looked inside, and there was nothing there but iron and strange works that I couldn’t understand. There were little strings of copper coming out of the box, and then a long string of iron, that led away over the tops of the houses.”The fairy stopped and shivered as he thought of the horrible string of iron. Then he went on: “I followed it and it came into another house, where there was so much iron that I couldn’t stay there. But the strings of iron came out of this house and led in all directions. I followed them and I listened everywhere and I found what they were for, though how they do it all I dunno. And it’s this way: Anywhere that there’s a box you can talk to them that’s in the house where all the iron strings go. And if they like to help you, you can talk to anybody else where there’s a box. It may be a mile off or it may be a dozen miles off. Many a time those in the house where all the strings are will not help them that wants to talk, but when they will, it’s easy. Yes, Your Majesty, one man talks to another ten miles off, as if he was standing by his side.”“Your Majesty,” said another fairy, “you saw yourself the bright lights that were at the place where the grass was, that we came to first, and you’ve seen thousands more of them since. Do you know that they’re not candles, and they’re not lamps, and that there’s no fire to them at all? There’s strings of something, whatever it is, from one of them to another, and the light goes through that, whatever it is.”“There’s another thing that they do with strings like that,” said still another fairy. “I saw men doing it not far from here. They made a hole in a rock and they put one end of a string in it. Then where the other end was, a man pushed a thing like a sort of handle, and the rock was all burst open, and nobody had touched it.”And another fairy said: “Your Majesty, there are boats all the time going across the rivers—across the running water. Of course we always knew that mortals could cross running water, but these boats go without sails or oars, like the ship that we came here on. To be sure I couldn’t go on one, because it was across running water, but I went near one, when it was at the shore, and it was all full of iron, and I got the most awful pains from being near it. It was as bad, almost, as I felt coming here, when I’ld get too near the iron sides of the ship.”“And a strange thing it was that I saw too,” said another fairy. “I saw people looking into little boxes of wood, so I looked in too. And in one I saw a woman dancing, and in another there were horses running, and in another I saw two men fighting. And it was not a real woman or real horses or real men, but only pictures that moved and did the things that real people and horses would do.”The King listened to all this and then he sat and thought. “What is there in it that I can’t do?” he asked. “Do you not all know of the coaches in Ireland that are drawn by horses without heads and driven by coachmen without heads?”All the fairies looked at one another and nodded and said, “Yes, yes, we know.”But Naggeneen came forward and stood before the throne. Nobody had noticed that he had been listening or that he was there. “And what if those coaches were in Ireland?” he said. “They had horses, though the horses had no heads. Can you make iron coaches go without any horses at all?”The King was trying to talk boldly, but he stammered and grew pale at the very thought of having anything to do with an iron coach, and he did not answer. He went on instead: “Can I not send any one of you on a message, as fast as the wind?”“But can you talk for ten miles,” Naggeneen asked, “and will the very voice of you go as fast as the lightning?”“Why would I want to be doin’ that,” said the King, “when I can send a messenger as fast as I like?”“That’s not the question,” said the cruel Naggeneen; “can you do it?”“I never tried,” said the King. “And can I not light up this palace,” he went on, “or any other palace, with diamonds? Can I not make a light so that a man who looks behind him when he is going on a journey or at work in the fields will think his house is on fire and run back?”“And when he has run back,” said Naggeneen, “will he find that his house is on fire? You know that he will not. It’s only glamour, and he’ll soon be laughing at you. Oh, we can catch a few firebugs in spiders’ webs and deceive a boy or a girl that’s passing, and maybe make them turn aside and dance with us, but can you put real lights all over the country for miles—lights that will burn on and on and show real things? Our lights are lies themselves and they can no more than lead a silly mortal astray for a time; their lights tell the truth. What else can you do?”The King had lost the most of his boldness. “They say,” he said, “that men can burst open the rock. Can I not do that as well?”“You can open this rock for us to pass through,” said Naggeneen; “and what then? A man can see it open for a moment, if you choose to let him, and the next minute it’s all as one as if you had never touched it. And the man thinks that’s wonderful, for he doesn’t know that you can do it no other way. All glamour again! Can you burst the rock open and leave it open, so that it will always be so, for mortal and for fairy?”“Why should I want to be doin’ that?” said the King.“For the same reason makes the men want to do it, but you couldn’t. And those boats that cross the river, full of iron—can you make them, and can you cross the running water in them?”The King had no voice to answer. “And the pictures in the boxes,” Naggeneen went on; “can you make pictures dance?”“Sure,” said the King, “I can make a man think he sees anything I like—a woman dancing or a horse running, or anything.”“Glamour! Glamour! Glamour!” cried Naggeneen. “You can make him think he sees! Yes, but he does not see. You can no more make a picture dance than you can cross a river!” And Naggeneen turned on his heel and walked off, as if he thought the King a poor creature that was not worth talking to.The King had no more courage left in him than if he had been talking to the King of All Ireland instead of to Naggeneen. “Naggeneen,” he cried, “come back and tell us something better nor all this. It’s not pleasant you are in your talk, and it’s often you make me angry with you, but after all you’re cleverer than any of us. Tell us what to do. It was not like this where we lived before. There we could do all manner of things that mortals could not, and they were afraid of us.”“And so here too,” said Naggeneen, “you can do all manner of things that mortals cannot, but they can do as many that you cannot—as many and better.”“But what are we to do,” the King went on, “to show them that we’re their masters? Sure we’re cleverer than them all out, and we can prove it in some way.”“King,” said Naggeneen, speaking as boldly as if he were himself a greater king, “you can never prove that you’re cleverer than men, for you’re not cleverer. It was a poor, wasted, weak, and sorrowful country that we came from, and it’s a rich, new, strong, and happy country that we’ve come to. There’s the differ. Clever you are, maybe, and your people, too, and I may be clever in my own way, and we may play our little tricks on mortals, as I did on the Sullivans, if they’re as stupid as them. But mortals can be cleverer than we ever can when they are clever, and they can beat us every time if they know how. And do you know why? Because they have what we have not—because they have souls. I heard a school-master say once that the word ‘mortal’ was made from a word that meant death. And they call mortals that, I’m thinkin’, because they never die. But you will die, King, and all your people, and I. We live on and on for thousands of years, and men come and change and pass away, but at the last day we shall be gone, as a bit of cloud up in the sky is gone when the sun shines on it. That’s why men will always be greater and finer and stronger than us, with all our magic.”The fairies were all so terrified that they shrank away from Naggeneen and clung together and shook, in their fright, for this fear of living for a long time and then going out like a candle is their greatest fear. There was not a bit of color left in the King’s face now. It was almost with a sob that he spoke again, and there was a kind of beseeching in his tone as he said: “Naggeneen, don’t talk like that to us! We don’t know it! It may be so, but we don’t know it! We’ve tried many a time to find out, but no one that knew would ever tell us! We may have souls! We don’t know that we’ve not! We may be saved!”“You do know it!” Naggeneen cried. “Why will you try to deceive yourselves? You’ve no soul and I’ve no soul, and there’s no way that we can have them. If there’d been any way, I’ld have had one long ago. But we’ll never have them, and mortals will always outwit us, if they half know how. Shall I tell you how one of them outwitted me—a big, lazy, stupid gommoch, with not enough brains to keep his neck safe?”The fairies were far past caring whether they heard a story or not, but they listened as Naggeneen went on. “I’m after tellin’ you,” he said, “that if there was any way that one of us could be gettin’ a soul, I’ld have had one long ago. This was the way I tried it, and a silly mortal outwitted me. Guleesh na Guss Dhu was the name that was on him. I had heard—and I believed it—that if I could get a mortal woman married to me—a woman with a soul—that I would get a soul, too, that way. Well, I was never over-modest in my tastes, you know, and I thought that the daughter of the King of France was about right for me. A beautiful girl she was, with the rose and the lily fighting in her cheeks, and she was eighteen years old. But sure I thought that the differ of a few thousand years in our ages would be nothing to me, and I hoped it would be nothing to her either.“I was living in a rath and wearing a green jacket then. All the others in the rath promised that they’ld help me. The King’s daughter was to be married to the son of the King of another country on November Eve; and you know there’s no better time to steal a girl than the night she’s to be married, and November Eve is a fine time, too, so it was settled that we’ld go over to France and steal her on that night. But, as you know, we needed a mortal to help us. How else could we be bringin’ her across from France? If we could put her on a horse behind a man, she’ld have flesh and blood to take a grip of, but if she was put up behind one of us, she might as well try to hold to a puff of smoke. You know that.“We got ready, making sure that we’ld find some fool of a mortal ready for us when the time came, and sure enough, when we’d been out for a little look at the country before starting, and were coming back, there sat this same Guleesh na Guss Dhu, between the rath and the gable of his father’s house, that was near by, staring up at the moon, like he’d never seen one before. There was no need to try to catch him or to bring him with us, or the likes of that. All we had to do was to let him hear us as we passed and let him see the door of the rath open, and in he came of himself to see what it was all about. We hadn’t let him see ourselves yet, but he heard us all calling: ‘My horse and bridle and saddle! My horse and bridle and saddle!’ and what did he do but call out after us: ‘My horse and bridle and saddle!’“There was the beam of a plough lying near, and I changed it into a horse for him, and pleased he was when he saw it standing forninst him, with its bridle of gold and saddle of silver and all. The minute he saw it he jumped on it, and then we let him see all ourselves and our horses, and he nearly fell off again, with the sight of the crowd of us.“Then I said to him: ‘Are you coming with us to-night, Guleesh?’“‘I am,’ he said.“And with that we set off, and we overtook the wind that was before us, and the wind that was behind us did not overtake us. And we never stopped till we came to the sea. Then every one of us said: ‘Hie over cap! Hie over cap!’ and Guleesh said it after us, and the next second we was all up in the air, and we never stopped till we was in Rome. And why the whole tribe wanted to go by the way of Rome, never a know I know, for it’s not on the way from Ireland to the palace of the King of France at all.“Then I spoke up to Guleesh and says I: ‘Do you know why we brought you here?’ says I. ‘The daughter of the King of France is to be married this night, and we mean to carry her off, and we need you so that she can sit behind you on the horse, for you are flesh and blood and she’ll have something to hold to. Will you do that for us now?’“‘I’ll do whatever you say,’ says Guleesh; ‘and where are we now, if you please?’“‘We’re in Rome,’ says I.“‘Oh, in Rome is it?’ says Guleesh. ‘Sure, then, I’m glad of that. The priest of our parish lost his place a little while ago, only because they said he drank too much, as if there’ld be any harm in that, and now is the fine time to go to the Pope and get a bull to put him back in his place.’“‘Ah, we’ve no time for that, Guleesh,’ says I, ‘and we must be gettin’ to the palace of the King of France before we lose any more.’“‘Not a foot will I go,’ says Guleesh, ’till I get the bull for the priest. You can go on and leave me here if you like, and you can stop for me when you come back.’“Well, we had more talk about it, and then one of the others says: ‘Sure, Naggeneen, we can’t go without him and we can’t get him to come with us, so we’ll have to try to get the Pope’s bull for him. Go with him to the Pope and help him all you can, and we’ll wait for you.’“‘Come with me, then,’ says I, and I took him by the hand, and before he knew how I did it, I had him in the room where the Pope was. The Pope was sitting by himself, reading a book, and he had a tumbler of hot whiskey, with a little bit of sugar, beside him on the table, all as comfortable as you please. ‘Now, Guleesh,’ says I, ‘ask him for the bull, and tell him that if he won’t give it to you, you’ll set the house on fire. Then leave the rest to me.’“So Guleesh walked up to him as bold as you please, and when the Pope saw him he was near scared to death, because he thought that nobody could get into the room where he was. Then Guleesh says to him: ‘Don’t be afraid, Your Honor; all I want of you is your bull to put our parish priest back in his place, that lost it some time ago, because somebody told lies about him and said that he drank too much. And when I have your bull I’ll be leavin’ you in peace again.’“‘Go on out o’ this,’ says the Pope; ‘where are all my servants?’ and he began calling for them, but Guleesh put his back against the door, so that nobody could open it on the other side, and then he began telling the Pope all about the priest, and the Pope had nothing to do but listen.“And when he was done the Pope refused up and down to give him any pardon for the priest. ‘Then,’ says Guleesh, ‘unless you give it to me at once I’ll burn your house.’ And with that I began blowing fire out of my mouth all around the room.“‘Oh, stop the fire,’ cries the Pope, ‘and I’ll give you the pardon or anything else you ask!’“So then I stopped the fire, and the Pope sat down and wrote the pardon for the priest, giving him back his old place, and gave it to Guleesh. That second I caught him by the hand and we were off again through the keyhole to where the other fairies were. In another minute we were all on our horses and away again. We overtook the wind that was before us, and the wind that was behind us did not overtake us till we were at the palace of the King of France. And there my fine boy Guleesh saw sights that he never saw the like of before.“The place was almost as fine as this of yours here. There were long tables all about it, with everything on them that a body would be wanting to eat and drink, and as fast as any of it was eaten or drunk, there was more put in its place. Then there were hundreds of noblemen and ladies, all in clothes of silk and velvet and gold and silver, and all covered with jewels, till they shone in the light of the gold chandeliers, almost like they’d been chandeliers themselves. And they were talking and laughing and singing and playing, and some of them were dancing—not so well as we dance, of course, when we’ve a mind, but enough to make Guleesh think he was seeing the grandest sight that ever was in the world entirely. And up at one end of the hall was an altar and two bishops, ready to marry the Princess to the King’s son as soon as it would be the right time.“‘And which of them all is the Princess?’ says Guleesh to me.“‘That one there near to ye,’ says I, pointing her out.”Naggeneen stopped in his story and seemed to forget for a moment that he was telling it. “Oh, but she was the beauty of the world!” he went on, speaking so low that the fairies could scarcely hear him. “There was the lily and the rose in her cheeks, and her arms like snow, and her hair like soft gold. Not like the gold that you dig out of the ground for your palace, but gold with life in it. And her eyes were like two big violets with the dew on them. And there stood the others all around her, all merry and happy, and she—“‘What is she crying for?’ says Guleesh to me. ‘Sure it’s not right that eyes like those would have tears in them.’“‘True for you, it’s not, Guleesh,’ said I, ‘and it’s because there’s no love in her heart for the man that she’s to be married to. It’s her father that’s compelling her, for he has some arrangement of the sort with the other King, that’s the father of the young man. And it’s for that,’ I said, ‘that we’re going to carry her off, and it’s the best thing we could be doing for her as well as ourselves.’“Just that minute the young Prince came and offered her his hand, and away they went in the dance, and the tears in her eyes all the time. And as soon as the dance was over, the King, her father, and the Queen, her mother, came and said that it was time they were married, and the two bishops waiting there all the time. So they led the Prince and the Princess up toward the altar, and she with the rose all gone out of her cheeks and only the lily left. But when they were not more than four yards from the altar I put out my foot before the Princess, and she fell, and then, with a word of a charm, I made her invisible to all but Guleesh and ourselves. Then I made a sign to Guleesh, and he took up the Princess and ran with her out of the hall, and all the rest of us after them. ‘My horse and bridle and saddle!’ says every one of us, and the same says Guleesh. He lifted the Princess up behind him on his horse and we were away again. We overtook the wind that was before us, and the wind that was behind us did not overtake us till we came to the sea. ‘Hie over cap!’ cried every one of us, and ‘Hie over cap!’ cried Guleesh, and in a moment we were in Ireland again.“Another minute and we were close to our own rath, and it was then that all the work of the night was lost. For then what did the fool Guleesh do but take the Princess in his arms and leap down off his horse, and he cried: ‘I call you to myself, in the name of—’ Oh, now, you little cowards, you’ve no call to shrink away like that and to try to be hiding in the dark corners! You know I can’t say the name that he said. But he said it, and then the enchantment was all gone, and he saw that the horse he’d been riding was nothing but the beam of a plough and that the horse that each of the others had was only an old broom, or maybe a rag weed, or the like of that.“And you know that there was no getting the Princess away from him after the words that he said. But I came close to her and struck her on the mouth. ‘Now, Guleesh,’ said I, ‘you may keep her if you will, but she’ll be dumb forever.’ And with that we all disappeared from them.“But you may be sure I watched them. They stood there together and Guleesh talked to her and tried to make her talk back, but it was of no use at all, and he soon found that she was dumb completely. Then he stood thinking what would he do with her, and at last he took her by the hand and started toward the priest’s house. It was getting near day now, and the priest was up by the time they came to the door, and he opened it himself. And when he saw Guleesh and the girl, sure he thought they were come to be married, and he said: ‘Ah, Guleesh, isn’t it the nice boy ye are, that ye can’t wait till a decent hour to be married, but ye must be comin’ to me this early? And don’t ye know I can’t marry ye lawfully anyway, and I put out of my place?’“Then says Guleesh: ‘Sure, father, you can marry me or anybody else you like, for you have your place back again, and here’s the Pope’s bull for that same. But it’s not that I come for, but to ask you to give shelter to this young lady, the daughter of the King of France.’“And with that he takes the Pope’s bull out of his pocket and gives it to the priest, and the priest looked at the writing and the seal and saw that there was no doubt but it was right. And so he made Guleesh and the Princess come in and sit down, while Guleesh told him the whole story, and not a word of it would he have believed only there was the Pope’s bull that he couldn’t deny, and so at long last he had to believe all that Guleesh told him. And the end of it was that the Princess stayed at the priest’s house, for they didn’t know how to send her back to her father’s palace, and they had no money, and she couldn’t speak to help them. And the priest gave out that she was the daughter of his brother, that lived in another county, and that she was making him a visit. And Guleesh went home and said how he’d been sleeping beside the rath all night.”Naggeneen paused in his story, while all the fairies drew quietly closer to him. “Do you see,” he said, “how I was tricked by a fool of a mortal? Oh, she was the beauty of the world, and he took her from me with a word, as easily as you’ld steal the butter out of a churn. And that was not all.“I said to myself that I was not done with my revenge on them yet. She could not speak and it was a sore punishment on the both of them. Yet she stayed on at the priest’s house. The priest wrote letters to her father, as I heard, and gave them to merchants who were travelling, but none of them ever reached him. And Guleesh got mighty serious about his soul all at once, so that he had to be at the priest’s house every day, and every day he saw the Princess. She could never talk to him, but she learned to make signs that he could understand. And so it went on for a year.“And then, when it was November Eve again, and we had been out of the rath and were all coming into it again in a great crowd, there sat Guleesh, the same as before. He couldn’t see us, but he must have heard us, for you could see that he was listening with all his ears. And I thought now was the fine time to be having the laugh on him. By that time everybody was shouting: ‘My horse and bridle and saddle! My horse and bridle and saddle!’ and Guleesh shouted as before: ‘My horse and bridle and saddle! My horse and bridle and saddle!’“‘Now is my chance to be even with him,’ thought I, and I said: ‘Ah, Guleesh, my boy, is that yourself that’s to the fore again? You’ll get no horse to-night and you’ll play no more tricks on us. How are you getting on with your Princess? Does she talk to you much? Or do you just like to sit and look at her?’“And when I said that, he looked so pale and so sad that I almost screamed with joy, and I couldn’t keep myself from whispering to the man that was next to me: ‘And isn’t he the stupid omadhaun, not to know that there’s an herb growing close to his own door that would give her back her speech if he’d only boil it and give it to her?’“‘It’s the stupid omadhaun he is,’ said the other man.“Oh, and it was me that was the omadhaun, to be saying it at all. Oh, why couldn’t I hold my jaw? But it was like some spell was on me, and I had to say it. I had to say it! I couldn’t have kept it back if I’d tried. And he heard every word!“It’s little more there is to tell. The next morning, as soon as there was light, there was Guleesh searching for any herb that was strange to him around the door. And it was not long till he found it. Then he boiled it, and he drank some of it himself, to see whether it might be poison, and it put him into a deep sleep. And when he woke he went to the priest’s house and told the whole story and gave the Princess some of the drink, and then she went to sleep and did not wake till the next day. And when she woke she had her speech back.“Ah, well, by this time they was both in love with each other, and all that I did for myself or against them had only helped them. But it was not long before the Princess was saying that she must be off to her father, and nothing that the priest and Guleesh could do would make her stay. So the priest took the jewels that she had on her when Guleesh first brought her, and he sold them and gave her the money, and she took it and paid her way back to France.“And after that great grief and melancholy came over Guleesh, and nothing would do him but he must start off for France to find the Princess again. Start off he did, and that was the last that I ever saw of him, only I heard that he found the Princess at her father’s court and that at long last they were married.”There was nothing strange in the last that Naggeneen had told—nothing more strange, I mean, than that a peasant boy should marry the daughter of the King of France—but his voice, before he had ended, was so low and so full of grief that all the other fairies kept very still to listen, and when he had told his story none of them spoke for a little while. At last the King said: “How long was all this ago, Naggeneen?”“Many years,” Naggeneen answered; “I couldn’t be counting how many.”“Then what is it to you now?” said the King. “Sure they’re both dead long ago, and here are you as sound as ever.”“Yes,” Naggeneen cried, “as sound as ever and as sound as I’ll ever be. They’re not dead. They had souls. They’re alive now, and when what they call ‘the Last Day’ comes, they’ll live still, forever. And then I shall go out, like a shadow when the light falls on it. There’s no more of me that can last than a shadow. And you will go out that way, too, and all of us. It was not her that I wanted so much. It was the soul that I thought I’ld get, and her married to me. That was it. And a stupid mortal had tricked me twice. It was then I left the rath. It was then I could bear to look at nobody, man or fairy. Then I put on the red jacket and went by myself. After a time I was a lepracaun, and a cluricaun, and nothing at all, as it suited me, and sometimes I lived in a rath with others, as I have in yours, and other times I went by myself. But I never forgot how I was tricked by a mortal, and I’ve never forgot how I missed getting a soul when I was near to it.“You’ve never liked me; you’ve always thought me sour and harsh and cruel. Do you see why now? Since that time I’ve always hated all men, because of the one that tricked me; and I’ve always hated all women, because of the one I lost; and I’ve always hated all fairies, because they are all as weak and helpless and pitiful as myself. I hate myself and I hate all of you, because there’s no good for any of us in all the world forever.”“Naggeneen,” said the King, “we’ve never been too fond of you, it’s true, but maybe we’ld have liked you better if you’d told us this before. But you’re cleverer than all of us. Tell us what we’ll do now, so that these mortals won’t be getting the better of us all out.”“What’ll you do?” Naggeneen answered; “there’s nothing you can do. They’ll outwit you, whatever you do.”“But there must be some way. Tell us what to do, Naggeneen,” the King pleaded.“I’ll tell you what to do, then,” said Naggeneen; “send out your people and let them learn the ways of men. Let them learn to make the iron coaches that go up in the air; let them learn to make the coaches that go on the ground, with the iron ropes; let them learn to talk miles away through iron strings; let them learn to make the bright lights that you see; let them learn to open the rock so that it will not close again; let them learn to cross running water in boats full of iron; let them learn to handle iron and do what they like with it, as if it were only gold, and then, maybe, they’ll be able to do all the things that men do.”The fairies were simply cowering away from the King and Naggeneen and shivering and squealing with fright at the talk of handling iron and crossing running water. “Ah, Naggeneen,” said the King, “you know we can’t do all that. Tell us what we’ll do at all.”“There’s nothing that you can do,” said Naggeneen. “There’s only one thing I know you can try, and I think that’ll do no good either.”“But what is it?” said the King. “We’ll try it, anyway.”“It’s not the time to try it yet,” Naggeneen answered. “When the time comes I’ll tell you.”“Then, Naggeneen,” said the King, “give us a tune out of the fiddle.”And Naggeneen took the fiddle and played. But there was no merriment in it now. It was only the breath of sorrow and loss and disappointment that breathed from the shivering strings. The fairies did not dance; they only stood and listened, pale and still. In a few moments the King gave the sign for Naggeneen to stop, and in a minute more the lights were out and the whole palace was as quiet as the hill, before any palace was there.","['crow', 'piece',

2343,irish,The Little White Cat,"A long, long time ago, in a valley far away, the giant Trencoss lived in a great castle, surrounded by trees that were always green. The castle had a hundred doors, and every door was guarded by a huge, shaggy hound, with tongue of fire and claws of iron, who tore to pieces anyone who went to the castle without the giant’s leave. Trencoss had made war on the King of the Torrents, and, having killed the king, and slain his people, and burned his palace, he carried off his only daughter, the Princess Eileen, to the castle in the valley. Here he provided her with beautiful rooms, and appointed a hundred dwarfs, dressed in blue and yellow satin, to wait upon her, and harpers to play sweet music for her, and he gave her diamonds without number, brighter than the sun; but he would not allow her to go outside the castle, and told her if she went one step beyond its doors, the hounds, with tongues of fire and claws of iron, would tear her to pieces. A week after her arrival, war broke out between the giant and the king of the islands, and before he set out for battle, the giant sent for the princess, and informed her that on his return he would make her his wife. When the princess heard this she began to cry, for she would rather die than marry the giant who had slain her father.“Crying will only spoil your bright eyes, my little princess,” said Trencoss, “and you will have to marry me whether you like it or no.”He then bade her go back to her room, and he ordered the dwarfs to give her everything she asked for while he was away, and the harpers to play the sweetest music for her. When the princess gained her room she cried as if her heart would break. The long day passed slowly, and the night came, but brought no sleep to Eileen, and in the grey light of the morning she rose and opened the window, and looked about in every direction to see if there were any chance of escape. But the window was ever so high above the ground, and below were the hungry and ever watchful hounds. With a heavy heart she was about to close the window when she thought she saw the branches of the tree that was nearest to it moving. She looked again, and she saw a little white cat creeping along one of the branches.“Mew!” cried the cat.“Poor little pussy,” said the princess. “Come to me, pussy.”“Stand back from the window,” said the cat, “and I will.”The princess stepped back, and the little white cat jumped into the room. The princess took the little cat on her lap and stroked him with her hand, and the cat raised up its back and began to purr.“Where do you come from, and what is your name?” asked the princess.“No matter where I come from or what’s my name,” said the cat, “I am a friend of yours, and I come to help you?”“I never wanted help worse,” said the princess.“I know that,” said the cat; “and now listen to me. When the giant comes back from battle and asks you to marry him, say to him you will marry him.”“But I will never marry him,” said the princess.“Do what I tell you,” said the cat. “When he asks you to marry him, say to him you will if his dwarfs will wind for you three balls from the fairy dew that lies on the bushes on a misty morning as big as these,” said the cat, putting his right forefoot into his ear and taking out three balls––one yellow, one red, and one blue.“They are very small,” said the princess. “They are not much bigger than peas, and the dwarfs will not be long at their work.”“Won’t they,” said the cat. “It will take them a month and a day to make one, so that it will take three months and three days before the balls are wound; but the giant, like you, will think they can be made in a few days, and so he will readily promise to do what you ask. He will soon find out his mistake, but he will keep his word, and will not press you to marry him until the balls are wound.”“When will the giant come back?” asked Eileen.“He will return to-morrow afternoon,” said the cat.“Will you stay with me until then?” said the princess. “I am very lonely.”“I cannot stay,” said the cat. “I have to go away to my palace on the island on which no man ever placed his foot, and where no man but one shall ever come.”“And where is that island?” asked the princess, “and who is the man?”“The island is in the far-off seas where vessel never sailed; the man you will see before many days are over; and if all goes well, he will one day slay the giant Trencoss, and free you from his power.”“Ah!” sighed the princess, “that can never be, for no weapon can wound the hundred hounds that guard the castle, and no sword can kill the giant Trencoss.”“There is a sword that will kill him,” said the cat; “but I must go now. Remember what you are to say to the giant when he comes home, and every morning watch the tree on which you saw me, and if you see in the branches anyone you like better than yourself,” said the cat, winking at the princess, “throw him these three balls and leave the rest to me; but take care not to speak a single word to him, for if you do all will be lost.”“Shall I ever see you again?” asked the princess.“Time will tell,” answered the cat, and, without saying so much as good-bye, he jumped through the window on to the tree, and in a second was out of sight.The morrow afternoon came, and the giant Trencoss returned from battle. Eileen knew of his coming by the furious barking of the hounds, and her heart sank, for she knew that in a few moments she would be summoned to his presence. Indeed, he had hardly entered the castle when he sent for her, and told her to get ready for the wedding. The princess tried to look cheerful, as she answered:“I will be ready as soon as you wish; but you must first promise me something.”“Ask anything you like, little princess,” said Trencoss.“Well, then,” said Eileen, “before I marry you, you must make your dwarfs wind three balls as big as these from the fairy dew that lies on the bushes on a misty morning in summer.”“Is that all?” said Trencoss, laughing. “I shall give the dwarfs orders at once, and by this time to-morrow the balls will be wound, and our wedding can take place in the evening.”“And will you leave me to myself until then?”“I will,” said Trencoss.“On your honour as a giant?” said Eileen.“On my honour as a giant,” replied Trencoss.The princess returned to her rooms, and the giant summoned all his dwarfs, and he ordered them to go forth in the dawning of the morn and to gather all the fairy dew lying on the bushes, and to wind three balls––one yellow, one red, and one blue. The next morning, and the next, and the next, the dwarfs went out into the fields and searched all the hedgerows, but they could gather only as much fairy dew as would make a thread as long as a wee girl’s eyelash; and so they had to go out morning after morning, and the giant fumed and threatened, but all to no purpose. He was very angry with the princess, and he was vexed with himself that she was so much cleverer than he was, and, moreover, he saw now that the wedding could not take place as soon as he expected.When the little white cat went away from the castle he ran as fast as he could up hill and down dale, and never stopped until he came to the Prince of the Silver River. The prince was alone, and very sad and sorrowful he was, for he was thinking of the Princess Eileen, and wondering where she could be.“Mew,” said the cat, as he sprang softly into the room; but the prince did not heed him. “Mew,” again said the cat; but again the prince did not heed him. “Mew,” said the cat the third time, and he jumped up on the prince’s knee.“Where do you come from, and what do you want?” asked the prince.“I come from where you would like to be,” said the cat.“And where is that?” said the prince.“Oh, where is that, indeed! as if I didn’t know what you are thinking of, and of whom you are thinking,” said the cat; “and it would be far better for you to try and save her.”“I would give my life a thousand times over for her,” said the prince.“For whom?” said the cat, with a wink. “I named no name, your highness,” said he.“You know very well who she is,” said the prince, “if you knew what I was thinking of; but do you know where she is?”“She is in danger,” said the cat. “She is in the castle of the giant Trencoss, in the valley beyond the mountains.”“I will set out there at once,” said the prince “and I will challenge the giant to battle, and will slay him.”“Easier said than done,” said the cat. “There is no sword made by the hands of man can kill him, and even if you could kill him, his hundred hounds, with tongues of fire and claws of iron, would tear you to pieces.”“Then, what am I to do?” asked the prince.“Be said by me,” said the cat. “Go to the wood that surrounds the giant’s castle, and climb the high tree that’s nearest to the window that looks towards the sunset, and shake the branches, and you will see what you will see. Then hold out your hat with the silver plumes, and three balls––one yellow, one red, and one blue––will be thrown into it. And then come back here as fast as you can; but speak no word, for if you utter a single word the hounds will hear you, and you shall be torn to pieces.”Well, the prince set off at once, and after two days’ journey he came to the wood around the castle, and he climbed the tree that was nearest to the window that looked towards the sunset, and he shook the branches. As soon as he did so, the window opened and he saw the Princess Eileen, looking lovelier than ever. He was going to call out her name, but she placed her fingers on her lips, and he remembered what the cat had told him, that he was to speak no word. In silence he held out the hat with the silver plumes, and the princess threw into it the three balls, one after another, and, blowing him a kiss, she shut the window. And well it was she did so, for at that very moment she heard the voice of the giant, who was coming back from hunting.The prince waited until the giant had entered the castle before he descended the tree. He set off as fast as he could. He went up hill and down dale, and never stopped until he arrived at his own palace, and there waiting for him was the little white cat.“Have you brought the three balls?” said he.“I have,” said the prince.“Then follow me,” said the cat.On they went until they left the palace far behind and came to the edge of the sea.“Now,” said the cat, “unravel a thread of the red ball, hold the thread in your right hand, drop the ball into the water, and you shall see what you shall see.”The prince did as he was told, and the ball floated out to sea, unravelling as it went, and it went on until it was out of sight.“Pull now,” said the cat.The prince pulled, and, as he did, he saw far away something on the sea shining like silver. It came nearer and nearer, and he saw it was a little silver boat. At last it touched the strand.“Now,” said the cat, “step into this boat and it will bear you to the palace on the island on which no man has ever placed his foot––the island in the unknown seas that were never sailed by vessels made of human hands. In that palace there is a sword with a diamond hilt, and by that sword alone the giant Trencoss can be killed. There also are a hundred cakes, and it is only on eating these the hundred hounds can die. But mind what I say to you: if you eat or drink until you reach the palace of the little cat in the island in the unknown seas, you will forget the Princess Eileen.”“I will forget myself first,” said the prince, as he stepped into the silver boat, which floated away so quickly that it was soon out of sight of land.The day passed and the night fell, and the stars shone down upon the waters, but the boat never stopped. On she went for two whole days and nights, and on the third morning the prince saw an island in the distance, and very glad he was; for he thought it was his journey’s end, and he was almost fainting with thirst and hunger. But the day passed and the island was still before him.At long last, on the following day, he saw by the first light of the morning that he was quite close to it, and that trees laden with fruit of every kind were bending down over the water. The boat sailed round and round the island, going closer and closer every round, until, at last, the drooping branches almost touched it. The sight of the fruit within his reach made the prince hungrier and thirstier than he was before, and forgetting his promise to the little cat––not to eat anything until he entered the palace in the unknown seas––he caught one of the branches, and, in a moment, was in the tree eating the delicious fruit. While he was doing so the boat floated out to sea and soon was lost to sight; but the prince, having eaten, forgot all about it, and, worse still, forgot all about the princess in the giant’s castle. When he had eaten enough he descended the tree, and, turning his back on the sea, set out straight before him. He had not gone far when he heard the sound of music, and soon after he saw a number of maidens playing on silver harps coming towards him. When they saw him they ceased playing, and cried out:“Welcome! welcome! Prince of the Silver River, welcome to the island of fruits and flowers. Our king and queen saw you coming over the sea, and they sent us to bring you to the palace.”The prince went with them, and at the palace gates the king and queen and their daughter Kathleen received him, and gave him welcome. He hardly saw the king and queen, for his eyes were fixed on the princess Kathleen, who looked more beautiful than a flower. He thought he had never seen anyone so lovely, for, of course, he had forgotten all about poor Eileen pining away in her castle prison in the lonely valley. When the king and queen had given welcome to the prince a great feast was spread, and all the lords and ladies of the court sat down to it, and the prince sat between the queen and the princess Kathleen, and long before the feast was finished he was over head and ears in love with her. When the feast was ended the queen ordered the ballroom to be made ready, and when night fell the dancing began, and was kept up until the morning star, and the prince danced all night with the princess, falling deeper and deeper in love with her every minute. Between dancing by night and feasting by day weeks went by. All the time poor Eileen in the giant’s castle was counting the hours, and all this time the dwarfs were winding the balls, and a ball and a half were already wound. At last the prince asked the king and queen for their daughter in marriage, and they were delighted to be able to say yes, and the day was fixed for the wedding. But on the evening before the day on which it was to take place the prince was in his room, getting ready for a dance, when he felt something rubbing against his leg, and, looking down, who should he see but the little white cat. At the sight of him the prince remembered everything, and sad and sorry he was when he thought of Eileen watching and waiting and counting the days until he returned to save her. But he was very fond of the princess Kathleen, and so he did not know what to do.“You can’t do anything to-night,” said the cat, for he knew what the prince was thinking of, “but when morning comes go down to the sea, and look not to the right or the left, and let no living thing touch you, for if you do you shall never leave the island. Drop the second ball into the water, as you did the first, and when the boat comes step in at once. Then you may look behind you, and you shall see what you shall see, and you’ll know which you love best, the Princess Eileen or the Princess Kathleen, and you can either go or stay.”The prince didn’t sleep a wink that night, and at the first glimpse of the morning he stole from the palace. When he reached the sea he threw out the ball, and when it had floated out of sight, he saw the little boat sparkling on the horizon like a newly-risen star. The prince had scarcely passed through the palace doors when he was missed, and the king and queen and the princess, and all the lords and ladies of the court, went in search of him, taking the quickest way to the sea. While the maidens with the silver harps played sweetest music, the princess, whose voice was sweeter than any music, called on the prince by his name, and so moved his heart that he was about to look behind, when he remembered how the cat had told him he should not do so until he was in the boat. Just as it touched the shore, the princess put out her hand and almost caught the prince’s arm, but he stepped into the boat in time to save himself, and it sped away like a receding wave. A loud scream caused the prince to look round suddenly, and when he did he saw no sign of king or queen, or princess, or lords or ladies, but only big green serpents, with red eyes and tongues, that hissed out fire and poison as they writhed in a hundred horrible coils.The prince, having escaped from the enchanted island, sailed away for three days and three nights, and every night he hoped the coming morning would show him the island he was in search of. He was faint with hunger and beginning to despair, when on the fourth morning he saw in the distance an island that, in the first rays of the sun, gleamed like fire. On coming closer to it he saw that it was clad with trees, so covered with bright red berries that hardly a leaf was to be seen. Soon the boat was almost within a stone’s cast of the island, and it began to sail round and round until it was well under the bending branches. The scent of the berries was so sweet that it sharpened the prince’s hunger, and he longed to pluck them; but, remembering what had happened to him on the enchanted island, he was afraid to touch them. But the boat kept on sailing round and round, and at last a great wind rose from the sea and shook the branches, and the bright, sweet berries fell into the boat until it was filled with them, and they fell upon the prince’s hands, and he took up some to look at them, and as he looked the desire to eat them grew stronger, and he said to himself it would be no harm to taste one; but when he tasted it the flavour was so delicious he swallowed it, and, of course, at once he forgot all about Eileen, and the boat drifted away from him and left him standing in the water.He climbed on to the island, and having eaten enough of the berries, he set out to see what might be before him, and it was not long until he heard a great noise, and a huge iron ball knocked down one of the trees in front of him, and before he knew where he was a hundred giants came running after it. When they saw the prince they turned towards him, and one of them caught him up in his hand and held him up that all might see him. The prince was nearly squeezed to death, and seeing this the giant put him on the ground again.“Who are you, my little man?” asked the giant.“I am a prince,” replied the prince.“Oh, you are a prince, are you?” said the giant. “And what are you good for?” said he.The prince did not know, for nobody had asked him that question before.“I know what he’s good for,” said an old giantess, with one eye in her forehead and one in her chin. “I know what he’s good for. He’s good to eat.”When the giants heard this they laughed so loud that the prince was frightened almost to death.“Why,” said one, “he wouldn’t make a mouthful.”“Oh, leave him to me,” said the giantess, “and I’ll fatten him up; and when he is cooked and dressed he will be a nice dainty dish for the king.”The giants, on this, gave the prince into the hands of the old giantess. She took him home with her to the kitchen, and fed him on sugar and spice and all things nice, so that he should be a sweet morsel for the king of the giants when he returned to the island. The poor prince would not eat anything at first, but the giantess held him over the fire until his feet were scorched, and then he said to himself it was better to eat than to be burnt alive.Well, day after day passed, and the prince grew sadder and sadder, thinking that he would soon be cooked and dressed for the king; but sad as the prince was, he was not half as sad as the Princess Eileen in the giant’s castle, watching and waiting for the prince to return and save her.And the dwarfs had wound two balls, and were winding a third.At last the prince heard from the old giantess that the king of the giants was to return on the following day, and she said to him:“As this is the last night you have to live, tell me if you wish for anything, for if you do your wish will be granted.”“I don’t wish for anything,” said the prince, whose heart was dead within him.“Well, I’ll come back again,” said the giantess, and she went away.The prince sat down in a corner, thinking and thinking, until he heard close to his ear a sound like “purr, purr!” He looked around, and there before him was the little white cat.“I ought not to come to you,” said the cat; “but, indeed, it is not for your sake I come. I come for the sake of the Princess Eileen. Of course, you forgot all about her, and, of course, she is always thinking of you. It’s always the way––“Favoured lovers may forget,Slighted lovers never yet.”The prince blushed with shame when he heard the name of the princess.“’Tis you that ought to blush,” said the cat; “but listen to me now, and remember, if you don’t obey my directions this time you’ll never see me again, and you’ll never set your eyes on the Princess Eileen. When the old giantess comes back tell her you wish, when the morning comes, to go down to the sea to look at it for the last time. When you reach the sea you will know what to do. But I must go now, as I hear the giantess coming.” And the cat jumped out of the window and disappeared.“Well,” said the giantess, when she came in, “is there anything you wish?”“Is it true I must die to-morrow?” asked the prince.“Then,” said he, “I should like to go down to the sea to look at it for the last time.”“You may do that,” said the giantess, “if you get up early.”“I’ll be up with the lark in the light of the morning,” said the prince.“Very well,” said the giantess, and, saying “good night,” she went away.The prince thought the night would never pass, but at last it faded away before the grey light of the dawn, and he sped down to the sea. He threw out the third ball, and before long he saw the little boat coming towards him swifter than the wind. He threw himself into it the moment it touched the shore. Swifter than the wind it bore him out to sea, and before he had time to look behind him the island of the giantess was like a faint red speck in the distance. The day passed and the night fell, and the stars looked down, and the boat sailed on, and just as the sun rose above the sea it pushed its silver prow on the golden strand of an island greener than the leaves in summer. The prince jumped out, and went on and on until he entered a pleasant valley, at the head of which he saw a palace white as snow.As he approached the central door it opened for him. On entering the hall he passed into several rooms without meeting with anyone; but, when he reached the principal apartment, he found himself in a circular room, in which were a thousand pillars, and every pillar was of marble, and on every pillar save one, which stood in the centre of the room, was a little white cat with black eyes. Arranged round the wall, from one door-jamb to the other, were three rows of precious jewels. The first was a row of brooches of gold and silver, with their pins fixed in the wall and their heads outwards; the second a row of torques of gold and silver; and the third a row of great swords, with hilts of gold and silver. And on many tables was food of all kinds, and drinking horns filled with foaming ale.While the prince was looking about him the cats kept on jumping from pillar to pillar; but seeing that none of them jumped on to the pillar in the centre of the room, he began to wonder why this was so, when, all of a sudden, and before he could guess how it came about, there right before him on the centre pillar was the little white cat.“Don’t you know me?” said he.“I do,” said the prince.“Ah, but you don’t know who I am. This is the palace of the Little White Cat, and I am the King of the Cats. But you must be hungry, and the feast is spread.”Well, when the feast was ended, the king of the cats called for the sword that would kill the giant Trencoss, and the hundred cakes for the hundred watch-dogs.The cats brought the sword and the cakes and laid them before the king.“Now,” said the king, “take these; you have no time to lose. To-morrow the dwarfs will wind the last ball, and to-morrow the giant will claim the princess for his bride. So you should go at once; but before you go take this from me to your little girl.”And the king gave him a brooch lovelier than any on the palace walls.The king and the prince, followed by the cats, went down to the strand, and when the prince stepped into the boat all the cats “mewed” three times for good luck, and the prince waved his hat three times, and the little boat sped over the waters all through the night as brightly and as swiftly as a shooting star. In the first flush of the morning it touched the strand. The prince jumped out and went on and on, up hill and down dale, until he came to the giant’s castle. When the hounds saw him they barked furiously, and bounded towards him to tear him to pieces. The prince flung the cakes to them, and as each hound swallowed his cake he fell dead. The prince then struck his shield three times with the sword which he had brought from the palace of the little white cat.When the giant heard the sound he cried out: “Who comes to challenge me on my wedding-day?”The dwarfs went out to see, and, returning, told him it was a prince who challenged him to battle.The giant, foaming with rage, seized his heaviest iron club, and rushed out to the fight. The fight lasted the whole day, and when the sun went down the giant said:“We have had enough of fighting for the day. We can begin at sunrise to-morrow.”“Not so,” said the prince. “Now or never; win or die.”“Then take this,” cried the giant, as he aimed a blow with all his force at the prince’s head; but the prince, darting forward like a flash of lightning, drove his sword into the giant’s heart, and, with a groan, he fell over the bodies of the poisoned hounds.When the dwarfs saw the giant dead they began to cry and tear their hair. But the prince told them they had nothing to fear, and he bade them go and tell the princess Eileen he wished to speak with her. But the princess had watched the battle from her window, and when she saw the giant fall she rushed out to greet the prince, and that very night he and she and all the dwarfs and harpers set out for the Palace of the Silver River, which they reached the next morning, and from that day to this there never has been a gayer wedding than the wedding of the Prince of the Silver River and the Princess Eileen; and though she had diamonds and pearls to spare, the only jewel she wore on her wedding-day was the brooch which the prince had brought her from the Palace of the Little White Cat in the far-off seas.","['king', 'certain', 'country', 'daughter', 'exceedingly', 'beautiful', 'also', 'remarkably', 'clever', 'many', 'king', 'prince', 'travel', 'distant', 'land', 'hope', 'make', 'wife',

2444,irish,"The Bee, the Harp, the Mouse and the Bum-Clock","Once there was a widow, and she had one son, called Jack. Jack and his mother owned just three cows. They lived well and happy for a long time; but at last hard times came down on them, and the crops failed, and poverty looked in at the door, and things got so sore against the poor widow that for want of money and for want of necessities she had to make up her mind to sell one of the cows. “Jack,” she said one night, “go over in the morning to the fair to sell the branny cow.”Well and good: in the morning my brave Jack was up early, and took a stick in his fist and turned out the cow, and off to the fair he went with her; and when Jack came into the fair, he saw a great crowd gathered in a ring in the street. He went into the crowd to see what they were looking at, and there in the middle of them he saw a man with a wee, wee Harp, a Mouse, and a Bum-clock (Cockroach), and a Bee to play the harp. And when the man put them down on the ground and whistled, the Bee began to play the Harp, and the Mouse and the Bum-clock stood up on their hind legs and got hold of each other and began to waltz. And as soon as the Harp began to play and the Mouse and the Bum-clock to dance, there wasn’t a man or woman, or a thing in the fair, that didn’t begin to dance also; and the pots and pans, and the wheels and reels jumped and jigged, all over the town, and Jack himself and the branny cow were as bad as the next.There was never a town in such a state before or since, and after a while the man picked up the Bee, the Harp, and the Mouse, and the Bum-clock and put them into his pocket, and the men and women, Jack and the cow, the pots and pans, wheels and reels, that had hopped and jigged, now stopped, and everyone began to laugh as if to break its heart. Then the man turned to Jack. “Jack,” says he, “how would you like to be master of all these animals?”“Why,” says Jack, “I should like it fine.”“Well, then,” says the man, “how will you and me make a bargain about them?”“I have no money,” says Jack.“But you have a fine cow,” says the man. “I will give you the Bee and the Harp for it.”“O, but,” Jack says, says he, “my poor mother at home is very sad and sorrowful entirely, and I have this cow to sell and lift her heart again.”“And better than this she cannot get,” says the man. “For when she sees the Bee play the Harp, she will laugh if she never laughed in her life before.”“Well,” says Jack, says he, “that will be grand.”He made the bargain. The man took the cow; and Jack started home with the Bee and the Harp in his pocket, and when he came home, his mother welcomed him back.“And, Jack,” says she, “I see you have sold the cow.”“I have done that,” says Jack.“Did you do well?” says the mother.“I did well, and very well,” says Jack.“How much did you get for her?” says the mother.“O,” says he, “it was not for money at all I sold her, but for something far better.”“O, Jack! Jack!” says she, “what have you done?”“Just wait until you see, mother,” says he, “and you will soon say I have done well.”Out of his pocket he takes the Bee and the Harp and sets them in the middle of the floor, and whistles to them, and as soon as he did this the Bee began to play the Harp, and the mother she looked at them and let a big, great laugh out of her, and she and Jack began to dance, the pots and pans, the wheels and reels began to jig and dance over the floor, and the house itself hopped about also.When Jack picked up the Bee and the Harp again the dancing all stopped, and the mother laughed for a long time. But when she came to herself, she got very angry entirely with Jack, and she told him he was a silly, foolish fellow, that there was neither food nor money in the house, and now he had lost one of her good cows also. “We must do something to live,” says she. “Over to the fair you must go to-morrow morning, and take the black cow with you and sell her.”And off in the morning at an early hour brave Jack started, and never halted until he was in the fair. When he came into the fair, he saw a big crowd gathered in a ring in the street. Said Jack to himself, “I wonder what are they looking at.”Into the crowd he pushed, and saw the wee man this day again with a Mouse and a Bum-clock, and he put them down in the street and whistled. The Mouse and the Bum-clock stood up on their hind legs and got hold of each other and began to dance there and jig, and as they did there was not a man or woman in the street who didn’t begin to jig also, and Jack and the black cow, and the wheels and the reels, and the pots and pans, all of them were jigging and dancing all over the town, and the houses themselves were jumping and hopping about, and such a place Jack or any one else never saw before.When the man lifted the Mouse and the Bum-clock into his pocket, they all stopped dancing and settled down, and everybody laughed right hearty. The man turned to Jack. “Jack,” said he, “I am glad to see you; how would you like to have these animals?”“I should like well to have them,” says Jack, says he, “only I cannot.”“Why cannot you?” says the man.“O,” says Jack, says he, “I have no money, and my poor mother is very down-hearted. She sent me to the fair to sell this cow and bring some money to lift her heart.”“O,” says the man, says he, “if you want to lift your mother’s heart I will sell you the Mouse, and when you set the Bee to play the Harp and the Mouse to dance to it, your mother will laugh if she never laughed in her life before.”“But I have no money,” says Jack, says he, “to buy your Mouse.”“I don’t mind,” says the man, says he, “I will take your cow for it.”“Jack,” says she, “I see you have sold the cow.”“I did that,” says Jack.“Did you sell her well?” says she.“Very well indeed,” says Jack, says he.“How much did you get for her?”“I didn’t get money,” says he, “but I got value.”“O, Jack! Jack!” says she, “what do you mean?”“I will soon show you that, mother,” says he, taking the Mouse out of his pocket and the Harp and the Bee and setting all on the floor; and when he began to whistle the Bee began to play, and the Mouse go up on its hind legs and began to dance and jig, and the mother gave such a hearty laugh as she never laughed in her life before. To dancing and jigging herself and Jack fell, and the pots and pans and the wheels and reels began to dance and jig over the floor, and the house jigged also. And when they were tired of this, Jack lifted the Harp and the Mouse and the Bee and put them in his pocket, and his mother she laughed for a long time.But when she got over that she got very down-hearted and very angry entirely with Jack. “And O, Jack,” she says, “you are a stupid good-for-nothing fellow. We have neither money nor meat in the house, and here you have lost two of my good cows, and I have only one left now. To-morrow morning,” she says, “you must be up early and take this cow to the fair and sell her. See to get something to lift my heart up.”“I will do that,” says Jack, says he. So he went to his bed, and early in the morning he was up and turned out the spotty cow and went to the fair.When Jack got to the fair, he saw a crowd gathered in a ring in the street. “I wonder what they are looking at, anyhow,” says he. He pushed through the crowd, and there he saw the same wee man he had seen before, with a Bum-clock; and when he put the Bum-clock on the ground, he whistled, and the Bum-clock began to dance, and the men, women, and children in the street, and Jack and the spotty cow began to dance and jig also, and everything on the street and about it, the wheels and reels, the pots and pans, began to jig, and the houses themselves began to dance likewise. And when the man lifted the Bum-clock and put it in his pocket, everybody stopped jigging and dancing and everyone laughed loud. The wee man turned, and saw Jack.“Jack, my brave boy,” says he, “you will never be right fixed until you have this Bum-clock, for it is a very fancy thing to have.”“O, but,” says Jack, says he, “I have no money.”“No matter for that,” says the man; “you have a cow, and that is as good as money to me.”“Well,” says Jack, “I have a poor mother who is very down-hearted at home, and she sent me to the fair to sell this cow and raise some money and lift her heart.”“O, but Jack,” says the wee man, “this Bum-clock is the very thing to lift her heart, for when you put down your Harp and Bee and Mouse on the floor, and put the Bum-clock along with them, she will laugh if she never laughed in her life before.”“Well, that is surely true,” says Jack, says he, “and I think I will make a swap with you.”So Jack gave the cow to the man and took the Bum-clock himself, and started for home. His mother was glad to see Jack back, and says she, “Jack, I see that you have sold the cow.”“I did that, mother,” says Jack.“Did you sell her well, Jack?” says the mother.“Very well indeed, mother,” says Jack.“How much did you get for her?” says the mother.“I didn’t take any money for her, mother, but value,” says Jack, and he takes out of his pocket the Bum-clock and the Mouse, and set them on the floor and began to whistle, and the Bee began to play the Harp and the Mouse and the Bum-clock stood up on their hind legs and began to dance, and Jack’s mother laughed very hearty, and everything in the house, the wheels and the reels, and the pots and pans, went jigging and hopping over the floor, and the house itself went jigging and hopping about likewise.When Jack lifted up the animals and put them in his pocket, everything stopped, and the mother laughed for a good while. But after a while, when she came to herself, and saw what Jack had done and how they were now without either money, or food, or a cow, she got very, very angry at Jack, and scolded him hard, and then sat down and began to cry.Poor Jack, when he looked at himself, confessed that he was a stupid fool entirely. “And what,” says he, “shall I now do for my poor mother?” He went out along the road, thinking and thinking, and he met a wee woman who said, “Good-morrow to you, Jack,” says she, “how is it you are not trying for the king’s daughter of Ireland?”“What do you mean?” says Jack.Says she: “Didn’t you hear what the whole world has heard, that the King of Ireland has a daughter who hasn’t laughed for seven years, and he has promised to give her in marriage, and to give the kingdom along with her to any man who will take three laughs out of her.”“If that is so,” says Jack, says he, “it is not here I should be.”Back to the house he went, and gathers together the Bee, the Harp, the Mouse, and the Bum-clock, and putting them into his pocket, he bade his mother good-bye, and told her it wouldn’t be long till she got news from him, and off he hurries.When he reached the castle, there was a ring of spikes all round the castle and men’s heads on nearly every spike there.“What heads are these?” Jack asked one of the king’s soldiers.“Any man that comes here trying to win the king’s daughter and fails to make her laugh three times, loses his head and has it stuck on a spike. These are the heads of the men that failed,” says he.“A mighty big crowd,” says Jack, says he. Then Jack sent word to tell the king’s daughter and the king that there was a new man who had come to win her.In a very little time the king and the king’s daughter and the king’s court all came out and sat themselves down on gold and silver chairs in front of the castle, and ordered Jack to be brought in until he should have his trial. Jack, before he went, took out of his pocket the Bee, the Harp, the Mouse, the Bum-clock, and he gave the Harp to the Bee, and he tied a string to one and the other, and took the end of the string himself, and marched into the castle yard before all the court, with his animals coming on a string behind him.When the queen and the king and the court and the princes saw poor ragged Jack with his Bee, and Mouse, and Bum-clock hopping behind him on a string, they set up one roar of laughter that was long and loud enough, and when the king’s daughter herself lifted her head and looked to see what they were laughing at, and saw Jack and his paraphernalia, she opened her mouth and she let out of her such a laugh as was never heard before.Then Jack dropped a low courtesy, and said, “Thank you, my lady; I have one of the three parts of you won.”Then he drew up his animals in a circle, and began to whistle, and the minute he did, the Bee began to play the Harp, and the Mouse and the Bum-clock stood up on their hind legs, got hold of each other, and began to dance, and the king and the king’s court and Jack himself began to dance and jig, and everything about the king’s castle, pots and pans, wheels and reels, and the castle itself began to dance also. And the king’s daughter, when she saw this, opened her mouth again, and let out of her a laugh twice louder than she let before, and Jack, in the middle of his jigging, drops another courtesy, and says, “Thank you, my lady; that is two of the three parts of you won.”Jack and his menagerie went on playing and dancing, but Jack could not get the third laugh out of the king’s daughter, and the poor fellow saw his big head in danger of going on the spike. Then the brave Mouse came to Jack’s help and wheeled round upon its heel, and at it did so its tail swiped into the Bum-clock’s mouth, and the Bum-clock began to cough and cough and cough. And when the king’s daughter saw this she opened her mouth again, and she let the loudest and hardest and merriest laugh that was ever heard before or since; and, “Thank you, my lady,” says Jack, dropping another courtesy; “I have all of you won.”Then when Jack stopped his menagerie, the king took himself and the menagerie within the castle. He was washed and combed, and dressed in a suit of silk and satin, with all kinds of gold and silver ornaments, and then was led before the king’s daughter. And true enough she confessed that a handsomer and finer fellow than Jack she had never seen, and she was very willing to be his wife.Jack sent for his poor old mother and brought her to the wedding, which lasted nine days and nine nights, every night better than the other. All the lords and ladies and gentry of Ireland were at the wedding. I was at it, too, and got brogues, broth and slippers of bread and came jigging home on my head.","['wizard', 'take', 'form', 'poor', 'house', 'caught', 'pretty', 'girl', 'knew', 'whither', 'carry',

2452,irish,The Little Good People,"There was a good deal of commotion that night in the rath near where the O’Briens and the Sullivans lived. Do you know what a rath is? I suppose not. It is hard work to tell stories to you, you are so ignorant. I will tell you what a rath is. First I will tell you what it looks like. It looks like a mound of earth, in the shape of a ring, covered with turf, and perhaps with bushes. They are found all over Ireland. Some people, who have studied so much that they have lost all track of what they know and of what they don’t know, say that these raths were made by the people who lived in Ireland many hundreds of years ago, and that they were strongholds to guard themselves and their sheep and their cattle from their enemies or from wild beasts. But people who know as much as Mrs. O’Brien, know that they are the places where the fairies live, or the Good People, as she would call them.On this night that I have been telling you about, the Good People inside the rath were eating and drinking and dancing and making merry generally, as they do, you know, the most of the time. Perhaps you would like to have me tell you how the inside of the rath looked too. I will do the best I can. In the first place, the walls were all of silver and the floor was all of gold. Perhaps you don’t know—no, I suppose you don’t know—still you may happen to have heard of this before: the fairies know just where to find pretty much all the gold and silver and precious stones that there are in the world, if they happen to want them. They don’t want much of them, of course—only just enough to make the walls and the roofs and the floors of their houses of, and to put all over their clothes and to make all their furniture and dishes of, and all their carriages and their boats, and a few other things—but they know where to find plenty of gold and silver, if they want it.Now I think that I had better give you a little science. I believe that a book which children are to read, always ought to teach something, so I mean to teach you as much as I can. You must know, then, that gold is one of the heaviest things in the world. Now you know that the earth is always whirling round and round, so that the things that it is made of naturally get shaken up more or less. Besides that, it was once a good deal softer than it is now, so that the things that it is made of could move about more than they can now. And so the most of the gold, being, as I said, one of the heaviest things, got sifted down toward the bottom—that is, toward the centre of the earth. Only a little of it was left near the top, compared with what went to the bottom. It would not be at all surprising if the middle of the earth were a solid lump of gold, a thousand miles thick. But we poor men cannot dig down very deep into the earth. We can only scratch a little dirt off the top, and if we happen to grub up a few pounds of gold we think that we are rich, and the rest of the world thinks so too.But the fairies laugh at us. They know how to go as deep into the earth as they choose, and so any fairy who chooses can give away gold all his life, and still have more of it in his dust-bin all the time than all the kings in the world have in their treasuries. And the other fairies don’t call him rich.But now we will go back to the rath. Of course it was all under the ground, so that there was no daylight. At the time we are talking about, there would not have been any anyway, for it was night. The place was lighted up with thousands of diamonds and rubies and emeralds, which were set all over the ceiling and shone like lamps. Now I won’t call you ignorant just because you say that you don’t understand how diamonds could light up anything, for I don’t understand it myself. Let us talk about it together and try to decide. Suppose you try the experiment. Some night, after dark, take all the diamonds you have—every one of them—and carry them into a dark room and spread them out, and see if they light up the room at all. I am sure that you will find that they do not. On the contrary, if you let go of them, you will have to go and get a light to hunt for them by. But I suppose the fairies have some other kind of diamonds than ours, or else they know some other way of using the same kind. Sometimes they use fireflies, caught in spider-web nets, but these are generally for out of doors. To light up their houses they almost always use diamonds.There were two tiny bits of turf fire in the rath. One of them was at one end of the hall, where the King sat, for the King to light his pipe by, and the other was at the other end, for the other fairy men to light their pipes by. Fairies do not like fire, as a rule, and they would never have any more of it about than they could help. But I know that they must have had some, for I know that Irish fairies smoke pipes, and how could they light them unless they kept a little fire on hand?Now, I know what you will say to that. You will say: “If they could light a room with diamonds, why couldn’t they light pipes with them?” Well, that is not very easy to answer, but I feel sure that even a fairy would never think of lighting a pipe with a diamond. I have owned up already that I don’t know exactly how they light rooms with them, but it is easier for me to imagine a diamond giving light than giving heat. Isn’t it for you? Now, be honest about it.At one end of the hall sat the King and the Queen, on their thrones. Near them were half a dozen fairy men who were playing on pipes and fiddles. All over the floor there were dozens and scores of fairies, men and women, dancing to the music. All around the walls stood or sat many more of them, looking at the dancers, and now and then applauding and shouting at particular ones, or talking together, or simply smoking their pipes.Suddenly two fairies rushed into the hall, with a little sound like the noise of a humming-bird’s wings when it passes close to you. From the lower end of the hall, where they came in, they went straight through the crowd to where the King and Queen sat. They dropped on their knees before them for an instant, and then rose and spoke to them. In a moment the King clapped his hands, with a sign for the pipers and the fiddlers to stop playing. The instant that they stopped, everybody in the hall was still.The King stood up and said to them: “Will ye be still now and listen, all of ye, to the news that’s come to me this minute, and then will ye help me to think what we’re to do about it at all? Here’s these two that’s just come in, and they’re just afther tellin’ me that they’ve been at the O’Briens’ house this evenin’, and there they heard talk betune the O’Briens and the Sullivans, and it’s all decided that both the O’Briens and the Sullivans is goin’ to the States. And it’s sorry I’ll be to see the O’Briens lavin’ the counthry. I don’t care so much for the Sullivans.”“It was the O’Briens,” said the Queen, “that always put the bit and sup outside the door for us, and what we’ll be doin’ widout the milk and the pertaties and the fresh wather, I dunno.”“Ye needn’t be throubled about that,” the King answered; “haven’t we always enough to eat and drink of our own, whatever happens?”“Thrue for you,” said the Queen, “we have our own food and drink, but it’s not the same that we get from human people. Ye know that same yourself, and it’s you as much as any that’ll be missin’ them things when the O’Briens is gone.”“That’s the thrue word too,” said the King; “it’ll be the bad day for us all out, when they go. What for are they lavin’ the counthry at all?”“If ye plase, Your Majesty,” said one of the fairies who had brought the news, “we heard all that too. It’s the hard times that’s in it. It’s that makes them all want to go, and then, more than that, it’s the bother the Sullivans are put to all the time, wid the cow givin’ no milk and the pig not gettin’ fat, and all that, and they’re bound that they’ll go away and stand it no longer.”“Is that it?” said the King. “It’s that divil Naggeneen that’s in it. I told him he could bother them a little if he liked, but not to bother them too much, and now he’s drivin’ them and their neighbors out of the counthry, and we all have to suffer for it. He’ll make it up to us in some way, if they go, or I’ll take it out of him. Come here, Naggeneen! What are ye doin’ down there by yourself? Come up here and stand forninst me, till I give ye a piece of me mind. Now, what’s all this about the O’Briens and the Sullivans lavin’ the counthry? What have ye been about wid them?”A fairy who had not been in the hall before had just come in at the far end from the King, who had caught sight of him. He was smoking a pipe. He had his hands in the pockets of his little green breeches, he wore a red jacket, and on his head was a red cap. He came slowly up the hall, when the King called him, and stood before the throne. “Take off your cap, ye worthless vagabone,” said the King, “when you speak to me.”“I wasn’t spakin’ to you,” said Naggeneen; “it was you that spoke to me. You called me, and here I am to the fore, though I don’t belong to your pitiful little thribe, and I needn’t come when you call, if I don’t like.”“Oh, needn’t ye?” said the King. “Take off your cap now, or it’ll be taken off for ye.”Naggeneen took off his cap.“Now,” said the King, “what have ye been doin’ to the Sullivans, that they’re lavin’ the counthry and persuadin’ the O’Briens to go wid them?”“I’ve been doin’ nothin’,” said Naggeneen, “but what you said I might do.”“Oh, haven’t ye?” said the King. “And what was that?”“Oh,” said Naggeneen, “I just took all the cream and the most of the milk from their cow, and you yourself had a share of it, as you know well; and I put a charm on their pig, so that it wouldn’t get fat, no matter how much it ‘uld be atin’; and then I druv the smoke of their fire down the chimney, and I threw the dishes and the pans around in the night, just so they wouldn’t get lazy wid restin’ too well, and a few more little things like that.”“Was that all ye did?” said the King. “And how long have ye been at it that way?”“Ever since the day that Mrs. Sullivan threw the dirthy wather on me, as I was passin’ the house. But I’m not the only one that’s in it. Some of your own people here have helped me, and good they are at divilment too.”“And those things was all you did, was they?” said the King. “And didn’t I tell ye ye could bother them a little, but not too much? What would ye have done if I had told ye to do what ye liked wid them?”“What would I have done then? Oh, I’ld have shown ye the real fun then. What would I have done then? I’ld have pinched them and stuck pins in them all day and all night. I’ld have put charms on themselves, so that they’ld grow thinner than the pig. I’ld have took the pertaties out of the creel when they were put to drain at the door. If they went away from home I’ld make them think that they saw their house burning up, and so I’ld scare them to death. What would I do if you gave me leave? What wouldn’t I do?”“Well, you’ve done enough as it is,” said the King, “to get the whole of us into throuble, and now let’s hear what you’re goin’ to do to get us out of it. Here they are lavin’ the counthry and takin’ the O’Briens wid them, that was always the good neighbors to us, and they themselves were sometimes useful in their own way, in spite of themselves. And now I ask ye, Naggeneen, what are ye goin’ to do to get us out of the throuble ye’ve got us into?”“I’m in no throuble meself,” Naggeneen answered, “and I dunno what I have to do wid any throuble that you may be in.”“You’re in no throuble yourself? Haven’t ye been as good as livin’ on the Sullivans all this time? And now what are ye goin’ to do widout them?”“I’m goin’ to do nothin’ widout them; I’m goin’ wid them.”“Goin’ wid them! Goin’ wid them!”“Them was me words; you and your silly little thribe can do what ye like; I’m goin’ wid them. It’s a stuffy little place, this rath of yours, and I’ve a notion thravellin’ would be good for me health, any way.”“But how can ye go wid them?”“It’s not hard at all,” said Naggeneen, “and it’s been done before this. I was near doin’ it meself once. I don’t suppose ye remember me old friend MacCarthy.”“MacCarthy of Ballinacarthy?” the King asked.“The same,” said Naggeneen, “and it was he was the good friend to mortal or fairy. It was he kept the good house and the good table and the good cellar—more especially the good cellar. That was not so many years ago—a hundred and odd, maybe. A fine man he was; we don’t see his like now. I lived wid him the most of the time—in the cellar. And the strange thing about him was that, though nobody ever had a bad word for him, though all his servants said that he was the kindest and the best masther that ever stepped, he could get nobody to stay in the place of butler. It was all well enough wid the rest—cooks, maids, hostlers, stable boys—but the first time ever a new butler went into that beautiful wine cellar for wine, back he’ld come in a hurry and say that he’ld lave his place the next day, and nothing on earth would keep him in it. Now, wasn’t that strange?”“Did you say you lived in that cellar?” the King asked.“The most of the time,” said Naggeneen.“Then it was not strange,” said the King.“Any way, strange or not strange,” Naggeneen went on, “it was the truth. Never a butler could he keep in his service. A new butler would come and he’ld think he was a made man, old MacCarthy was that well known and that well liked all over the counthry. He’ld wait once at dinner and then down he’ld go to the cellar for wine. Sometimes he’ld come back wid the wine and oftener he’ld come back widout it, but every time he’ld say: ‘Mr. MacCarthy, sir, it’s much obliged to you I am for all your kindness, but I’ll have to be lavin’ your service to-morrow.’ And nobody could see the why of it.“And at long last there was young Jack Leary, that had been all his life in old MacCarthy’s stable, and he knew how the old man was bad off for a butler, and he made bold to ask for the place. ‘If I make ye me butler,’ says the old man, ‘will ye go into the cellar and bring the wine when I ask ye, and make no throuble about it?’“‘Is that all?’ says Jack; ‘sure, yer honor, I’ld be glad to spend all me time, day and night, in the cellar, only ye might be wantin’ me somewhere else now and then.’“‘Then look sharp,’ says old MacCarthy, ‘for there’s gintlemin comin’ to dinner to-day. Wait on the table the best ye know how, and at the end of it, when I ring the bell three times, do ye go to the cellar and bring plenty of wine, and let’s have no more nonsinse about it.’“‘Niver say it twice,’ says Jack; ‘yer honor can depind on me.’“Well, ye may belave I was listenin’ to all this, for I wasn’t in the cellar all the time. ‘His honor may say it twice,’ says I to meself, ‘or as many times as he likes, but you’ll never go into that cellar twice, Jack, me fine boy.’“So Jack went about his work, and the dinner went all well enough, till late in the evenin’, when old MacCarthy rang the bell three times, and off started Jack for the cellar, wid a basket to bring back the wine. ‘It’s the silly lot they war,’ says he to himself, ‘thim butlers, that they’ld be afraid to go to the cellar and bring back a bit of a basket full of wine. The only thing I don’t like about it is that I can’t bring it back in me skin instead of in the basket.’“He was thinkin’ like this in his mind as he went down the long, dark stairs wid his candle, and you may depend I was ready for him, by the time he got to the bottom. So no sooner did he touch the key to the lock than I give him a sort of a laugh and a scream that set the empty wine bottles that stood outside the door a-dancin’ together. Jack was a good bold boy, sure enough, and he got the key into the lock and turned it. Wid that I swung the door open for him, so hard that it crashed against the wall and near shook the house down. And then me fine boy saw all the casks and the hogsheads in the cellar a-swingin’ and a-rockin’ and a-whirlin’ around, as if all the wine had been in him instead of in them.“You may be sure he didn’t wait long afther that, but he just dropped his basket and fell all the way up the stairs and into the room where the gintlemin was waitin’ for their wine. Well, it was then that old MacCarthy was in the towerin’ rage. Never a word could Jack say to tell where he’d been or how he came back, or why.“‘Gintlemin,’ says MacCarthy, ‘ye’ll get your wine, if I have to go to the cellar for it meself. But this I tell ye: I’ll live no longer in this house, where I can’t get servants to serve me. I’ll be lavin’ it to-morrow, and no later. The next time ye find me at home, ye’ll find me in a place where I can keep a butler and have him do his work.’“Wid that he took the lantern and started for the cellar himself. Ye’ll guess that I was in the dining-room as soon as Jack and heard all this, and I was back in the cellar, too, before MacCarthy got there. I was sittin’ on a cask of port, when he came in and saw me be the light of the lantern. I was sittin’ there, wid a spiggot over me shoulder. ‘Are ye there?’ says MacCarthy. ‘Who are ye, anyway, and what are ye doin’ there?’“‘Sure, your honor,’ says I, ‘a’n’t we goin’ to move to-morrow, and it’s not the likes of a kind man like you that would be wishin’ to lave poor little Naggeneen behind.’“‘Is that the way of it?’ says MacCarthy. ‘Well, if you’re agoin’ to move wid us, I see no use in movin’ at all. If I’m to have you in me cellar, wherever it is, it may as well be at Ballinacarthy as anywhere.’“And from that day till the day of his death me and old MacCarthy was the best of friends. And he always brought all his wine from the cellar himself.”“And what has all that to do wid us?” said the King.“What has it to do wid ye?” said Naggeneen. “It has nothin’ to do wid ye, unless ye want to make it, and never a care I care whether ye do or not. But it has a good deal to do wid me. It shows, doesn’t it, that I was ready to go wid old MacCarthy, and him runnin’ away from me; and just so I’m ready to go wid the Sullivans, now that they’re runnin’ away from me. I’ve given ye a good hint. Ye can do as ye plase.”“It’s glad I’ld be,” said the Queen, “if we could be rid of the Sullivans and Naggeneen both at once, but I dunno what we’ll do at all if the O’Briens go away.”“I’m not over-fond of Naggeneen meself,” said the King, “but it’s a sharp bit of a boy he is, and I’m thinkin’ he may not be far from right this time. It might be that a new counthry would be as good for us as for the O’Briens or the Sullivans, and, anyway, we’ld still be near to them.”“Do ye mean,” the Queen said, “that ye think we might all go to the States along wid the O’Briens and the Sullivans and Naggeneen?”“If Naggeneen goes,” the King replied, “he’ll go along wid us; we’ll not go wid him; but it was just that same that I was thinkin’. And yet we couldn’t do a thing like that widout the lave of the King of All Ireland.”When the King spoke of the King of All Ireland, of course he meant the King of all the fairies in Ireland. He was himself only the King of this rath. Of course you know that the people of Ireland have no kings of their own any more.“Naggeneen, me boy,” said the King, “just take your fut in your hand and go to the King of All Ireland. Give him me compliments and ask him would he think there was anything against the whole of us goin’ to the States.”“Is it me that would be runnin’ arrants to the King of All Ireland,” Naggeneen answered: “me, that don’t belong to your thribe at all, and forty lazy spalpeens around here wearin’ their legs off wid dancin’ or rustin’ them off wid doin’ nothin’ at all?”“It’s thrue you don’t belong to me thribe,” said the King, “and glad I am of that same. But while ye stay in me rath ye’ll do what I bid ye. Why would I kape a dog and bark meself? Go on, now, and do what I tell ye, or ye know what I’ll do to ye. Be off now!”Naggeneen was off.Now, while Naggeneen is gone with his message to the King of All Ireland, I will just take a minute to say something that I have felt like saying for quite a little while. He will not be gone much more than a minute. What I have to say is this: Nearly all the people in this story, mortals and fairies, too, had the way of speaking that most Irish people have, which we call a brogue. Mrs. O’Brien had only a little of it—just the bit of a soft brogue that comes from Dublin, where she had lived for a long time. The most of the others had a good deal more. But as I go on with the story from here, I see no use in trying to write the brogue. It is hard to spell and confusing to read. If you do not know what a good Irish brogue is, you would never learn from any attempt of mine to spell it out for you; and if you do know what it is, you can put it in for yourself. I may have to try to write a little of it now and then, for there is some Irish that does not look like Irish when it is written in English, but I shall use as little of it after this as I can. Naggeneen is back by this time.Naggeneen sauntered into the hall where the King and the Queen and all the company were waiting for him, with his hands in his pockets, quite as if he had been out for a quiet stroll and had come back because he was tired of it. “Well,” said the King, “did you see the King of All Ireland?”“I saw him with my good-looking eyes,” Naggeneen answered.“And what did he say?”“He said he’ld come here and talk to you himself, and, by the look of him, I think it’s a pleasant time he’ll be giving you.”“Then why is he not here as soon as you?” the King asked.“Oh, nothing would do for him,” said Naggeneen, “but that he and his men must come on horseback. They can come no faster that way, but they think it’s due to their dignity. They had to wait for the horses to be ready, and so I beat them.”Naggeneen had scarcely said this when the door flew open at the end of the hall, and, with a rush and a whirl, in came a great troupe of fairies on horseback—the King of All Ireland and his men. They all leaped down from their horses, and instantly every horse turned into a green rush, such as grows beside the bogs. The King of All Ireland walked quickly up to the King of the rath and stood before him, with an awful frown on his face. The King of the rath was plainly nervous. “Will you have a light for your pipe, Your Majesty?” he asked.“Never mind my pipe now,” said the King of All Ireland. “Tell me first of all, who is this messenger that you sent to me?” The King of All Ireland had only a little bit of brogue—the Dublin kind.“Sure,” said the King of the rath, “that’s only poor Naggeneen.”“Only poor Naggeneen!” cried the King of All Ireland. “And what are you doing with him? Do you see the red jacket he has on? Why doesn’t he wear a green jacket, like your people? You know what his red jacket means as well as I. He belongs to the fairies who live by themselves, not to those who live together honestly in a rath. Why do you have him with your honest green jackets?”“Sure, Your Majesty,” said the King of the rath, “I thought it was no harm. He said he was tired of being by himself, and you know how handy he is with the fiddle or the pipes. If he’d been a fir darrig, that’s always playing tricks and making trouble everywhere, why, then, of course—but he was only a poor cluricaun—”“Yes,” the King of All Ireland interrupted, “only a poor cluricaun, that does nothing but rob gentlemen’s wine cellars and keep himself so drunk that he’s of no use when he’s wanted for any good. And hasn’t he made you as much trouble as any fir darrig could do?”“I was a lepracaun, too, once, Your Majesty,” Naggeneen said.“A lepracaun, were you? What did you do then? And when was it and how did it happen that a lazy lump like you was ever a lepracaun?”“It was a long time ago,” said Naggeneen, ready enough to talk about anything to draw the King’s thoughts away from the trouble that he had made. “After old MacCarthy, of Ballinacarthy, died, those that came after him did not keep up his cellar well, and I felt lonely and sad, and I didn’t care to drink any more—”“Lonely and sad you must have been,” said the King of All Ireland; “but you did drink still, did you not, though you didn’t care for it?”“True for you, Your Majesty,” said Naggeneen, “I did a little, just for my health. But I was so lonely and so falling to pieces with idleness—”“Falling to pieces with idleness!” the King interrupted again. “If idleness could make you fall to pieces, there wouldn’t have been a piece of you left big enough to make trouble in a fly’s eye, these last seven hundred years.”“As you say, Your Majesty,” Naggeneen went on, “but, anyway, I was a lepracaun, and I did what any other lepracaun does: I sat in the field or under a tree and made brogues. But it was sorry work and people was always trying to catch me, to make me show them the gold they thought I had. And one time a great brute of a spalpeen did catch me, and he nearly broke me in two with the squeeze he gave me, so that I wouldn’t get away till I’d showed him the gold. And I nearly had to show it to him, but I made him look away for a second, and then of course I was off. And after that my friend the King here let me come and live in the rath, just for company—not that I belong to his little tribe at all.”“And now you see,” said the King of All Ireland, turning from Naggeneen to the King of the rath, “what trouble comes to you from taking those into your rath that have no right there. He’s sending people out of Ireland that might be of use to you and to all of us. He wants to go with them, and that is no loss, but you want to go, too and to take all your people. That might be a loss, though I don’t know that it would.”“We think it’s best that we should go, Your Majesty,” the King of the rath answered, meekly, “if you see no reason why not.”“I see reasons enough why not,” said the King of All Ireland. “You don’t know where you are going, nor what you’ll find there. You don’t know how you’re to live, nor whether it’ll be any fit place to live. You don’t know whether the people there will help you or hinder you.”“Wherever the O’Briens go, they’ll help us,” the King of the rath answered. “We don’t like to have them leave us here.”“You’ve gone contrary to the law enough already,” said the King of All Ireland, “in taking in this fellow with the red coat. Now you may take all the consequences of it and go where you like. I don’t care where you go and I think nobody cares, only I think it may be best for all the Good People in Ireland to have you out of it. Mount your horses,” he shouted to his men, “and we’ll be off out of this!”He took one of the little green rushes from the floor and sat astride it, as a little boy rides on his father’s cane. “Borram, borram, borram!” he said, and instantly the rush was a beautiful white horse. Every one of his men did the same. Each one took one of the rushes and sat astride of it and said, “Borram, borram, borram!” and every one of the rushes grew into a horse. There was a little whirring sound, like that of a swarm of bees, and they were all gone.Everybody in the rath was silent for a few minutes. The King and the Queen looked at each other and were much troubled. Naggeneen, without making a bit of noise, scuttled down to the farthest corner of the hall. The others seemed not to know where to look or what to do or to think. Then the King turned toward them and said; “It’s all over; we couldn’t stay here now. Wherever has Naggeneen got to?”The fairies who were nearest to Naggeneen hustled him forward and he stood before the King again. “Naggeneen,” said the King, “it’s trouble enough you’ve made for all of us, and it’s ballyragging enough you and all the rest of us have got for it, and we don’t know, as His Majesty said, what more is to come. So now do the only thing you was ever good for and give us a tune out of the fiddle.”It was the only thing that Naggeneen was good for, and the only thing that was not mischief that he liked to do. He took a fiddle from one of the fairies who had been playing for the dancing before all the confusion began. He held the fiddle under his chin for a moment, while everybody waited, and then he began to play.He played first some old tunes that every fairy in Ireland knows well. But not every fairy in Ireland can play them as Naggeneen did. They were tunes which everybody listening in that rath had known for hundreds of years. There were wild and strange airs that made them remember days when Ireland was a strange country, even to them; then the music was full of wonder and mystery, like the spells of the old Druids; then it was strong and free and fierce, and they thought of Finn McCool and the Fenians, and the days when Erin had heroes to guard her from her foes. The fiddle was telling them the story of their own lives and of all that they had ever seen and known. Now it was a strange music, which they could not understand—which the player could understand as little as the rest—but it was soft and sweet, and yet deep and bold, and the fairies trembled as they remembered the holy Patrick and a mighty power in the worlds of the seen and of the unseen. This passed away and the music came with the stir and the swing of marching men, and the fairies were again in the days of King Brian Boru, with Ireland free and brave and strong. It grew sad; it gushed out like sobs from a broken heart; then it was quieter, but still full of a softer sorrow; now it was merry and reckless. It made the fairies remember all that they had ever seen in the lives of the people whom they had known so long—the cruel hardship, war, sickness, hunger, and then, besides, the faith, the kindliness, the light-heartedness that had saved them through it all. There were tunes that every man and woman in Ireland knows—tunes that you know—old airs that every Irish fiddler or piper or singer learns from the older ones, that the oldest ones of all learned, they say, from the fairies. And under all the music, whether grave or gay, there went a strain of grief, sometimes almost harsh and sometimes scarcely heard, and as the fairies listened to it they grew pale at the thought that now they were to go away from all that they had known, to find something which they did not know. While they were thinking of this the music changed again. It was a soft murmur, like the sound of the sea that is kept forever in a sea-shell. Then it grew loud and rough, with the rush of winds and the crash of waves. The fairies were filled with fright, and before they knew that they were afraid, the music was singing a song of hope, and then, all at once, it grew as merry as if there had never been a sad thought in the world.For a moment the fairies listened to it and all their feet began to stir restlessly on the floor. One of the fairy men caught the hand of a fairy girl—a fairy girl with cheeks like the tiny petals in the heart of a rose, with a white gown like a mist, and hair like fine sunbeams falling on the mist; he threw his arm about her waist, and they danced away down the hall. In an instant all the rest were dancing, too, alone, in pairs, and in rings. Naggeneen looked on and laughed till he could scarcely play. All this time his music had moved him less than anybody else who heard it. He did not feel what he had made the others feel, but he knew how to pour it all out of his fiddle.The King made a sign for him to stop. All the dancers were still in an instant. The lights in the hall went out. The next minute, if you had been outside the rath and had laid your ear down on the turf which covered it, you would have heard nothing more than you might hear under the turf at any other time or in any other place.","['klaas', 'bommel', 'dutch', 'twelve', 'year', 'live', 'plentiful', 'five', 'foot', 'high', 'weigh', 'hundred', 'pound', 'rosy', 'cheek', 'appetite', 'always', 'good', 'mother',

2454,irish,The Enchanted Cave,"A long, long time ago, Prince Cuglas, master of the hounds to the high King of Erin, set out from Tara to the chase. As he was leaving the palace the light mists were drifting away from the hill-tops, and the rays of the morning sun were falling aslant on the grinan or sunny bower of the Princess Ailinn. Glancing towards it the prince doffed his plumed and jewelled hunting-cap, and the princess answered his salute by a wave of her little hand, that was as white as a wild rose in the hedges in June, and leaning from her bower, she watched the huntsman until his tossing plumes were hidden by the green waving branches of the woods.The Princess Ailinn was over head and ears in love with Cuglas, and Cuglas was over head and ears in love with the Princess Ailinn, and he believed that never was summer morning half as bright, or as sweet, or as fair as she. The glimpse which he had just caught of her filled his heart with delight, and almost put all thought of hunting out of his head, when suddenly the tuneful cries of the hounds, answered by a hundred echoes from the groves, broke upon his ear.The dogs had started a dappled deer that bounded away through the forest. The prince, spurring his gallant steed, pushed on in eager pursuit.On through the forest sped the deer, through soft, green, secret ways and flowery dells, then out from the forest, up heathery hills, and over long stretches of moorland, and across brown rushing streams, sometimes in view of the hounds, sometimes lost to sight, but always ahead of them.All day long the chase continued, and at last, when the sun was sinking, the dogs were close upon the panting deer, and the prince believed he was about to secure his game, when the deer suddenly disappeared through the mouth of a cave which opened before him. The dogs followed at his heels, and the prince endeavoured to rein in his steed, but the impetuous animal bore him on, and soon was clattering over the stony floor of the cave in perfect darkness. Cuglas could hear ahead of him the cries of the hounds growing fainter and fainter, as they increased the distance between them and him. Then the cries ceased altogether, and the only sound the prince heard was the noise of his horse’s hoofs sounding in the hollow cave. Once more he endeavoured to check his career, but the reins broke in his hands, and in that instant the prince felt the horse had taken a plunge into a gulf, and was sinking down and down, as a stone cast from the summit of a cliff sinks down to the sea. At last the horse struck the ground again, and the prince was almost thrown out of his saddle, but he succeeded in regaining his seat. Then on through the darkness galloped the steed, and when he came into the light the prince’s eyes were for some time unable to bear it. But when he got used to the brightness he saw he was galloping over a grassy plain, and in the distance he perceived the hounds rushing towards a wood faintly visible through a luminous summer haze. The prince galloped on, and as he approached the wood he saw coming towards him a comely champion, wearing a shining brown cloak, fastened by a bright bronze spear-like brooch, and bearing a white hazel wand in one hand, and a single-edged sword with a hilt made from the tooth of a sea-horse in the other and the prince knew by the dress of the champion, and by his wand and sword, that he was a royal herald. As the herald came close to him the prince’s steed stopped of his own accord.“You are welcome, Cuglas,” said the herald, “and I have been sent by the Princess Crede to greet you and to lead you to her court, where you have been so long expected.”“I know not how this may be,” said Cuglas.“How it has come about I shall tell you as we go along,” said the herald. “The Princess Crede is the Queen of the Floating Island. And it chanced, once upon a day, when she was visiting her fairy kinsmen, who dwell in one of the pleasant hills that lie near Tara, she saw you with the high king and princes and nobles of Erin following the chase. And seeing you her heart went out to you, and wishing to bring you to her court, she sent one of her nymphs, in the form of a deer, to lure you on through the cave, which is the entrance to this land.”“I am deeply honoured by the preference shown me by the princess,” said Cuglas, “but I may not tarry in her court; for above in Erin there is the Lady Ailinn, the loveliest of all the ladies who grace the royal palace, and before the princess and chiefs of Erin she has promised to be my bride.”“Of that I know not,” said the herald; “but a true champion, like you, cannot, I know, refuse to come with me to the court of the Princess Crede.”As the herald had said these words the prince and he were on the verge of the wood, and they entered upon a mossy pathway that broadened out as they advanced until it was as wide as one of the great roads of Erin. Before they had gone very far the prince heard the tinkling of silver bells in the distance, and almost as soon as he heard them he saw coming up towards him a troop of warriors on coal black steeds. All the warriors wore helmets of shining silver, and cloaks of blue silk. And on the horses’ breasts were crescents of silver, on which were hung tiny silver bells, shaking out music with the motion of the horses. As the prince approached the champions they lowered their spears, and dividing in two lines the prince and the herald passed between the ranks, and the champions, forming again, followed on behind the prince.At last they passed through the wood, and they found themselves on a green plain, speckled with flowers, and they had not gone far when the prince saw coming towards him a hundred champions on snow-white steeds, and around the breasts of the steeds were crescents of gold, from which were hanging little golden bells. The warriors all wore golden helmets, and the shafts of their shining spears were of gold, and golden sandals on their feet, and yellow silken mantles fell down over their shoulders. And when the prince came near them they lowered their lances, and then they turned their horses’ heads around and marched before him. And it was not long until above the pleasant jingle of the bells the prince heard the measured strains of music, and he saw coming towards him a band of harpers, dressed in green and gold, and when the harpers had saluted the prince they marched in front of the cavalcade, playing all the time, and it was not long until they came to a stream that ran like a blue riband around the foot of a green hill, on the top of which was a sparkling palace; the stream was crossed by a golden bridge, so narrow that the horsemen had to go two-by-two. The herald asked the prince to halt and to allow all the champions to go before him; and the cavalcade ascended the hill, the sunlight brightly glancing on helmet and on lance, and when it reached the palace the horsemen filed around the walls.When at length the prince and herald crossed the bridge and began to climb the hill, the prince thought he felt the ground moving under them, and on looking back he could see no sign of the golden bridge, and the blue stream had already become as wide as a great river, and was becoming wider every second.“You are on the floating island now,” said the herald, “and before you is the palace of the Princess Crede.”At that moment the queen came out through the palace door, and the prince was so dazzled by her beauty, that only for the golden bracelet he wore upon his right arm, under the sleeve of his silken tunic, he might almost have forgotten the Princess Ailinn. This bracelet was made by the dwarfs who dwell in the heart of the Scandinavian Mountains, and was sent with other costly presents by the King of Scandinavia to the King of Erin, and he gave it to the princess, and it was the virtue of this bracelet, that whoever was wearing it could not forget the person who gave it to him, and it could never be loosened from the arm by any art or magic spell; but if the wearer, even for a single moment, liked anyone better than the person who gave it to him, that very moment the bracelet fell off from the arm and could never again be fastened on. And when the princess promised her hand in marriage to the Prince Cuglas, she closed the bracelet on his arm.The fairy queen knew nothing about the bracelet, and she hoped that before the prince was long in the floating island he would forget all about the princess.“You are welcome, Cuglas,” said the queen, as she held out her hand, and Cuglas, having thanked her for her welcome, they entered the palace together.“You must be weary after your long journey,” said the queen. “My page will lead you to your apartments, where a bath of the cool blue waters of the lake has been made ready for you, and when you have taken your bath the pages will lead you to the banquet hall, where the feast is spread.”At the feast the prince was seated beside the queen, and she talked to him of all the pleasures that were in store for him in fairyland, where pain, and sickness, and sorrow, and old age, are unknown, and where every rosy hour that flies is brighter than the one that has fled before it. And when the feast was ended the queen opened the dance with the prince, and it was not until the moon was high above the floating island that the prince retired to rest.He was so tired after his journey and the dancing that he fell into a sound sleep. When he awoke the next morning the sun was shining brightly, and he heard outside the palace the jingle of bells and the music of baying hounds, and his heart was stirred by memories of the many pleasant days on which he had led the chase over the plains and through the green woods of Tara.He looked out through the window, and he saw all the fairy champions mounted on their steeds ready for the chase, and at their head the fairy queen. And at that moment the pages came to say the queen wished to know if he would join them, and the prince went out and found his steed ready saddled and bridled, and they spent the day hunting in the forest that stretched away for miles behind the palace, and the night in feasting and dancing.When the prince awoke the following morning he was summoned by the pages to the presence of the queen. The prince found the queen on the lawn outside the palace surrounded by her court.“We shall go on the lake to-day, Cuglas,” said the queen, and taking his arm she led him along the water’s edge, all the courtiers following.When she was close to the water she waved her wand, and in a second a thousand boats, shining like glass, shot up from beneath the lake and set their bows against the bank. The queen and Cuglas stepped into one, and when they were seated two fairy harpers took their places in the prow. All the other boats were soon thronged by fairies, and then the queen waved her wand again, and an awning of purple silk rose over the boat, and silken awning of various colours over the others, and the royal boat moved off from the bank followed by all the rest, and in every boat sat a harper with a golden harp, and when the queen waved her wand for the third time, the harpers struck the trembling chords, and to the sound of the delightful music the boats glided over the sunlit lake. And on they went until they approached the mouth of a gentle river sliding down between banks clad with trees. Up the river, close to the bank and under the drooping trees, they sailed, and when they came to a bend in the river, from which the lake could be no longer seen, they pushed their prows in against the bank, and the queen and Cuglas, and all the party, left the boats and went on under the trees until they came to a mossy glade.Then the queen waved her wand, and silken couches were spread under the trees, and she and Cuglas sat on one apart from the others, and the courtiers took their places in proper order.And the queen waved her wand again, and wind shook the trees above them, and the most luscious fruit that was ever tasted fell down into their hands; and when the feast was over there was dancing in the glades to the music of the harps, and when they were tired dancing they set out for the boats, and the moon was rising above the trees as they sailed away over the lake, and it was not long until they reached the bank below the fairy palace.Well, between hunting in the forest, and sailing over the lake, and dancing in the greenwood glade and in the banquet hall, the days passed, but all the time the prince was thinking of the Princess Ailinn, and one moonlit night, when he was lying awake on his couch thinking of her, a shadow was suddenly cast on the floor.The prince looked towards the window, and what should he see sitting on the sill outside but a little woman tapping the pane with a golden bodkin.The prince jumped from his couch and opened the window, and the little woman floated on the moonbeams into the room and sat down on the floor.“You are thinking of the Princess Ailinn,” said the little woman.“I never think of anyone else,” said the prince.“I know that,” said the little woman, “and it’s because of your love for each other, and because her mother was a friend to me in the days gone by, that I have come here to try and help you; but there is not much time for talking, the night advances. At the bank below a boat awaits you. Step into it and it will lead you to the mainland, and when you reach it you will find before you a path that will take you to the green fields of Erin and the plains of Tara. I know you will have to face danger. I know not what kind of danger; but whatever it may be do not draw your sword before you tread upon the mainland, for if you do you shall never reach it, and the boat will come back again to the floating island; and now go and may luck go with you;” and saying this the little woman climbed up the moonbeams and disappeared.The prince left the palace and descended to the lake, and there before him he saw a glistening boat; he stepped into it, and the boat went on and on beneath the moon, and at last he saw the mainland, and he could trace a winding pathway going away from the shore. The sight filled his heart with joy, but suddenly the milk-white moonshine died away, and looking up to the sky he saw the moon turning fiery red, and the waters of the lake, shining like silver a moment before, took a blood-red hue, and a wind arose that stirred the waters, and they leaped up against the little boat, tossing it from side to side. While Cuglas was wondering at the change, he heard a strange, unearthly noise ahead of him, and a bristling monster, lifting its claws above the water, in a moment was beside the boat and stuck one of his claws in the left arm of the prince, and pierced the flesh to the bone. Maddened by the pain the prince drew his sword and chopped off the monster’s claw. The monster disappeared beneath the lake, and, as it did so, the colour of the water changed, and the silver moonlight shone down from the sky again, but the boat no longer went on towards the mainland, but sped back towards the floating island, while forth from the island came a fleet of fairy boats to meet it, led by the shallop of the fairy queen. The queen greeted the prince as if she knew not of his attempted flight, and to the music of the harps the fleet returned to the palace.The next day passed and the night came, and again the prince was lying on the couch, thinking of the Princess Ailinn, and again he saw the shadow on the floor and heard the tapping against the window.And when he opened it the little woman slid into the room.“You failed last night,” she said, “but I come to give you another chance. To-morrow the queen must set out on a visit to her fairy kinsmen, who dwell in the green hill near the plain of Tara; she cannot take you with her, for if your feet once touched the green grass that grows in the fruitful fields of Erin, she could never bring you back again. And so, when you find she has left the palace, go at once into the banquet hall and look behind the throne, and you will see a small door let down into the ground. Pull this up and descend the steps which you will see. Where they lead to I cannot tell. What dangers may be before you I do not know; but this I know, if you accept anything, no matter what it is, from anyone you may meet on your way, you shall not set foot on the soil of Erin.”And having said this the little woman, rising from the floor, floated out through the window.The prince returned to his couch, and the next morning, as soon as he heard the queen had left the palace, he hastened to the banquet hall. He discovered the door and descended the steps, and he found himself in a gloomy and lonesome valley. Jagged mountains, black as night, rose on either side, and huge rocks seemed ready to topple down upon him at every step. Through broken clouds a watery moon shed a faint, fitful light, that came and went as the clouds, driven by a moaning wind, passed over the valley.Cuglas, nothing daunted, pushed on boldly until a bank of cloud shut out completely the struggling moon, and closing over the valley covered it like a pall, leaving him in perfect darkness. At the same moment the moaning wind died away, and with it died away all sound. The darkness and the death-like silence sent an icy chill to the heart of Cuglas. He held his hand close to his eyes, but he saw it not. He shouted that he might hear the sound of his own voice, but he heard it not. He stamped his foot on the rocky ground, but no sound was returned to him. He rattled his sword in its brazen scabbard, but it gave no answer back to him. His heart grew colder and colder, when suddenly the cloud above him was rent in a dozen places, and lightning flashed through the valley, and the thunder rolled over the echoing mountains. In the lurid glare of the lightning Cuglas saw a hundred ghostly forms sweeping towards him, uttering as they came nearer and nearer shrieks so terrible that the silence of death could more easily be borne. Cuglas turned to escape, but they hemmed him round, and pressed their clammy hands upon his face.With a yell of horror he drew his sword and slashed about him, and that very moment the forms vanished, the thunder ceased, the dark cloud passed, and the sun shone out as bright as on a summer day, and then Cuglas knew the forms he had seen were those of the wild people of the glen.With renewed courage he pursued his way through the valley, and after three or four windings it took him out upon a sandy desert. He had no sooner set foot upon the desert than he heard behind him a crashing sound louder than thunder. He looked around, and he saw that the walls of mountain through which he had just passed had fallen into the valley, and filled it up so that he could no longer tell where it had been.The sun was beating fiercely on the desert, and the sands were almost as hot as burning cinders; and as Cuglas advanced over them his body became dried up, and his tongue clove to the roof of his mouth, and when his thirst was at its height a fountain of sparkling water sprang up in the burning plain a few paces in front of him; but when he came up quite close to it and stretched out his parched hands to cool them in the limped waters, the fountain vanished as suddenly as it appeared. With great pain, and almost choking with heat and thirst, he struggled on, and again the fountain sprang up in front of him and moved before him, almost within his reach. At last he came to the end of the desert, and he saw a green hill up which a pathway climbed; but as he came to the foot of the hill, there, sitting right in his way, was a beautiful fairy holding out towards him a crystal cup, over the rim of which flowed water as clear as crystal. Unable to resist the temptation, the prince seized the cold, bright goblet, and drank the water. When he did so his thirst vanished, but the fairy, and the green hill, and the burning desert disappeared, and he was standing in the forest behind the palace of the fairy queen.That evening the queen returned, and at the feast she talked as gaily to the prince as if she knew not of his attempt to leave the Floating Island, and the prince spoke as gaily as he could to her, although in his heart there was sadness when he remembered that if he had only dashed away the crystal cup, he would be at that moment in the royal banquet hall of Tara, sitting beside the Princess Ailinn.And he thought the feast would never end; but it was over at last, and the prince returned to his apartments. And that night, as he lay on his couch, he kept his eyes fixed upon the window; but hours passed, and there was no sign of anyone. At long last, and when he had given up all hope of seeing her, he heard a tapping at the window, and he got up and opened it, and the little woman came in.“You failed again to-day,” said she––“failed just at the very moment when you were about to step on the green hills of Erin. I can give you only one chance more. It will be your last. The queen will go hunting in the morning. Join the hunt, and when you are separated from the rest of the party in the wood throw your reins upon your horse’s neck and he will lead you to the edge of the lake. Then cast this golden bodkin into the lake in the direction of the mainland, and a golden bridge will be thrown across, over which you can pass safely to the fields of Erin; but take care and do not draw your sword, for if you do your steed will bear you back again to the Floating Island, and here you must remain for ever.” Then handing the bodkin to the prince, and saying good-bye, the little woman disappeared.The next morning the queen and the prince and all the court went out to hunt, and a fleet white deer started out before them, and the royal party pressed after him in pursuit. The prince’s steed outstripped the others, and when he was alone the prince flung the reins upon his horse’s neck, and before long he came to the edge of the lake.Then the prince cast the bodkin on to the water, and a golden bridge was thrown across to the mainland, and the horse galloped on to it, and when the prince was more than half-way he saw riding towards him a champion wearing a silver helmet, and carrying on his left arm a silver shield, and holding in his right hand a gleaming sword. As he came nearer he struck his shield with his sword and challenged the prince to battle. The prince’s sword almost leaped out of its scabbard at the martial sound, and, like a true knight of Tara, he dashed against his foe, and swinging his sword above his head, with one blow he clove the silver helmet, and the strange warrior reeled from his horse and fell upon the golden bridge. The prince, content with this achievement, spurred his horse to pass the fallen champion, but the horse refused to stir, and the bridge broke in two almost at his feet, and the part of it between him and the mainland disappeared beneath the lake, carrying with it the horse and the body of the champion, and before the prince could recover from his surprise, his steed wheeled round and was galloping back, and when he reached the land he rushed through the forest, and the prince was not able to pull him up until he came to the palace door.All that night the prince lay awake on his couch with his eyes fixed upon the window, but no shadow fell upon the floor, and there was no tapping at the pane, and with a heavy heart he joined the hunting party in the morning. And day followed day, and his heart was sadder and sadder, and found no pleasure in the joys and delights of fairyland. And when all in the palace were at rest he used to roam through the forest, always thinking of the Princess Ailinn, and hoping against hope that the little woman would come again to him, but at last he began to despair of ever seeing her. It chanced one night he rambled so far that he found himself on the verge of the lake, at the very spot from which the golden bridge had been thrown across the waters, and as he gazed wistfully upon them a boat shot up and came swiftly to the bank, and who should he see sitting in the stern but the little woman.“Ah, Cuglas, Cuglas,” she said, “I gave you three chances, and you failed in all of them.”“I should have borne the pain inflicted by the monster’s claw,” said Cuglas. “I should have borne the thirst on the sandy desert, and dashed the crystal cup untasted from the fairy’s hand; but I could never have faced the nobles and chiefs of Erin if I had refused to meet the challenge of the battle champion on the golden bridge.”“And you would have been no true knight of Erin, and you would not have been worthy of the wee girl who loves you, the bonny Princess Ailinn, if you had refused to meet it,” said the little woman; “but for all that you can never return to the fair hills of Erin. But cheer up, Cuglas, there are mossy ways and forest paths and nestling bowers in fairyland. Lonely they are, I know, in your eyes now,” said the little woman; “but maybe,” she added, with a laugh as musical as the ripple on a streamlet when summer is in the air, “maybe you won’t always think them so lonely.”“You think I’ll forget Ailinn for the fairy queen,” said Cuglas, with a sigh.“I don’t think anything of the kind,” said she.“Then what do you mean?” said the prince.“Oh, I mean what I mean,” said the little woman. “But I can’t stop here all night talking to you: and, indeed, it is in your bed you ought to be yourself. So now good night; and I have no more to say, except that perhaps, if you happen to be here this night week at this very hour, when the moon will be on the waters, you will see–––. But no matter what you will see,” said she; “I must be off.”And before the prince could say another word the boat sped away from the bank, and he was alone. He went back to the palace, and he fell asleep that night only to dream of the Princess Ailinn.As for the princess, she was pining away in the palace of Tara, the colour had fled from her cheeks, and her eyes, which had been once so bright they would have lighted darkness like a star, lost nearly all their lustre, and the king’s leeches could do nothing for her, and at last they gave up all hope, and the king and queen of Erin and the ladies of the court watched her couch by night and by day sadly waiting for her last hour.At length one day, when the sun was shining brightly over Tara’s plain, and its light, softened by the intervening curtains, was falling in the sick chamber, the royal watchers noticed a sweet change coming over the face of the princess; the bloom of love and youth were flushing on her cheeks, and from her eyes shone out the old, soft, tender light, and they began to hope she was about to be restored to them, when suddenly the room was in darkness as if the night had swept across the sky, and blotted out the sun. Then they heard the sound of fairy music, and over the couch where the princess lay they beheld a gleam of golden light, but only for a moment; and again there was perfect darkness, and the fairy music ceased. Then, as suddenly as it came the darkness vanished, the softened sunlight once more filled the chamber, and rested upon the couch; but the couch was empty, and the royal watchers, looking at each other, said in whispers: “The fairies have carried away the Princess Ailinn to fairyland.”Well, that very day the prince roamed by himself through the forest, counting the hours until the day would fade in the sky and the moon come climbing up, and at last, when it was shining full above the waters, he went down to the verge of the lake, and he looked out over the gleaming surface watching for the vision promised by the little woman. But he could see nothing, and was about to turn away when he heard the faint sound of fairy music. He listened and listened, and the sound came nearer and clearer, and away in the distance, like drops of glistening water breaking the level of the lake, he saw a fleet of fairy boats, and he thought it was the fairy queen sailing in the moonlight. And it was the fairy queen, and soon he was able to recognise the royal shallop leading the others, and as it came close to the bank he saw the little woman sitting in the prow between the little harpers, and at the stern was the fairy queen, and by her side the lady of his heart, the Princess Ailinn. In a second the boat was against the bank, and the princess in his arms. And he kissed her again and again.“And have you never a kiss for me,” said the little woman, tapping his hand with the little gold bodkin.“A kiss and a dozen,” said Cuglas, as he caught the little fairy up in his arms.“Oh, fie, Cuglas,” said the queen.“Oh, the princess isn’t one bit jealous,” said the little woman. “Are you, Ailinn?”“Indeed I am not,” said Ailinn.“And you should not be,” said the fairy queen, “for never lady yet had truer knight than Cuglas. I loved him, and I love him dearly. I lured him here hoping that in the delights of fairyland he might forget you. It was all in vain. I know now that there is one thing no fairy power above or below the stars, or beneath the waters, can ever subdue, and that is love. And here together forever shall you and Cuglas dwell, where old age shall never come upon you, and where pain or sorrow or sickness are unknown.”And Cuglas never returned to the fair hills of Erin, and ages passed away since the morning he followed the hounds into the fatal cave, but his story was remembered by the firesides, and sometimes, even yet, the herdboy watching his cattle in the fields hears the tuneful cry of hounds, and follows it till it leads him to a darksome cave, and as fearfully he listens to the sound becoming fainter and fainter he hears the clatter of hoofs over the stony floor, and to this day the cave bears the name of the prince who entered it never to return.","['meamei', 'pleiades', 'live', 'earth', 'seven', 'sister', 'remarkable', 'beauty', 'long', 'hair',

2500,irish,The Priest,"It is said by those who ought to understand such things, that the good people, or the fairies, are some of the angels who. were turned out of heaven, and who landed on their feet in this world, while the rest of their companions, who had more sin to sink them, went down further to a worse place. Be this as it may, there was a merry troop of the fairies, dancing and playing all manner of wild pranks on a bright moonlight evening towards the end of September. The scene of their merriment was not far distant from Inchegeela, in the west of the county Cork – a poor village, although it had a barrack for soldiers; but great mountains and barren rocks, like those round about it, are enough to strike poverty into any place however, as the fairies can have every thing they want for wishing, poverty does not trouble them much, and all their care is to seek out unfrequented nooks and places where it is not likely any one will come to spoil their sport.On a nice green sod by the river’s side were the little fellows dancing in a ring as gaily as may be, with their red caps wagging about at every bound in the moonshine; and so light were these bounds, that the lobes of dew, although they trembled under their feet, were not disturbed by their capering. Thus did they carry on their gambols, spinning round and round, and twirling and bobbing, and diving and going through all manner of figures, until one of them chirped out,“Cease, cease, with your drumming,Here’s an end to our mumming,By my smellI can tellA priest this way is coming!”And away every one of the fairies scampered off as hard as they could, concealing themselves under the green leaves of the lusmore, where, if their little red caps should happen to peep out, they would only look like its crimson bells; and more hid themselves in the hollow of stones, or at the shady side ol’ brambles, and others under the bank of the river, and in holes and crannies of one kind or another.The fairy speaker was not mistaken; for along the road, which was within view of the river, came Father Horrigan on his pony, thinking to himself that as it was so late he would make an end of his journey at the first cabin he came to. According to this determination, he stopped at the dwelling of Dermod Leary, lifted the latch, and entered with ” My blessing on all here.”I need not say that Father Horrigan was a welcome guest wherever he went, for no man was more pious or better beloved in the country. Now it was a great trouble to Dermod that he had nothing to offer his reverence for supper as a relish to the potatoes which ” the old woman,” for so Dermod called his wife, though she was not much past twenty, had down boiling in the pot over the fire; he thought of the net which be had set in the river, but as it had been there only a short time, the chances were against his finding a fish in it. ” No matter,” thought Dermod, “there can be no harm in stepping down to try, and may be as I want the fish for the priest’s supper that one will be there before me.”Down to the river side went Dermod, and he found in the net as fine a salmon as ever jumped in the bright waters of “the spreading Lee;” but as he was going to take it out, the net was pulled from him, he could not telll how or by whom, and away got the salmon, and went swimming along with the current as gaily as if nothing had happened.Dermod looked sorrowfully at the wake which the fish had left upon the water, shining like a line of silver in the moonlight, and then,. with an angry motion of his right hand, and a stamp of his foot, gave vent to his feelings by muttering, “May bitter bad luck attend you night and day for a blackguard schemer of a salmon, wherever you go! You ought to be ashamed of yourself, if there ‘s any shame in you, to give me the slip after this fashion And I’m clear in my own mind you’ll come to no good, for some kind of evil thing or other helped you – did I not feel it pull the net against me as strong as the devil himself?”That’s not true for you,” said one of the little fairies, who had scampered off at the approach of the priest, coming up to Dermod Leary, with a whole throng of companions at his heels; “there was only a dozen and a half of us pulling against you.”Dermod gazed on the tiny speaker with wonder, who continued, “Make yourself noways uneasy about the priest’s supper; for if you will go back and ask him one question from us, there will be as fine a supper as ever was put on a table spread out before him in less than no time.”” I’ll have nothing at all to do with you,” replied Dermod, in a tone of determination; and after a pause he added, “I’m much obliged to you for your offer, sir, but I know better than to sell myself to you or the like of you for a supper; and more than that, I know Father Horrigan has more regard for my soul than to wish me to pledge it for ever, out of regard to any thing you could put before him – so there’s an end of the matter.”The little speaker, with a pertinacity not to be repulsed by Dermod’s manner, continued, ” Will you ask the priest one civil question for us?”Dermod considered for some time, and he was right in doing so, but he thought that no one could come to harm out of asking a civil question. “I see no objection to do that same, gentlemen,” said Dermod; ” but I will have nothing in life to do with your supper,. – mind that.”Then,” said the little speaking fairy, whilst the rest came crowding after him from all parts, “go and ask Father Horrigan to tell us whether our souls will be saved at the last day, like the souls of good Christians; and if you wish us well, bring back word what lie says without delay.”Away went Dermod to his cabin, where he found the potatoes thrown out on the table, and his good woman handing the biggest of them all, a beautiful laughing red apple, smoking like a hard-ridden horse on a frosty night, over to Father Horrigan.Please your reverence,” said Dermod, after some hesitation, ” may I make bold to ask your honour one question?”“What may that be?” said Father Horrigan.“Why, then, begging your reverence’s pardon for my freedom, it is, If the souls of the good people are to be saved at the last day?”“Who bid you ask me that question, Leary?” said the priest, fixing his eyes upon him very sternly, which Dermod could not stand before at all.“I’ll tell no lies about the matter, and nothing in life but the truth,” said Dermod. “It was the good people themselves who sent me to ask the question, and there they are in thousands down on the bank of the river waiting for me to go back with the answer.“Go back by all means,” said the priest, “and tell them, if they want to know, to come here to me themselves, and I’ll answer that or any other question they are pleased to ask with the greatest pleasure in life.”Dermod accordingly returned to the fairies, who came swarming round about him to hear what the priest had said in reply; and Dermod spoke out among them like a bold man as lie was: but when they heard that they must go to the priest, away they fled, some here and more there; and some this way and more that, whisking by poor Dermod so fast and in such numbers, that hewas quite bewildered.When he came to himself; which was not for a long time, back he went to his cabin and ate his dry potatoes along with Father Horrigan, who made quite light of the thing; but Dermod could not help thinking it a mighty hard case that his reverence, whose words had the power to banish the fairies at such a rate, should have no sort of relish to his supper, and that the fine salmon he had in the net should have been got away from him in such a manner.","['bird', 'bird',

2512,irish,The Legend of Knocksheogowna,"In Tipperary is one of the most singularly shaped hills in the world. It has got a peak at the top like a conical nightcap thrown carelessly over your head as you awake in the morning. On the very point is built a sort of lodge, where in the’ summer the lady who built it and her friends used to go on parties of pleasure; but that was long after the days of the fairies, and it is, I believe, now deserted.But before lodge was built, or acre sown, there was close to the head of this bill a large pasturage, where a herdsman spent his days and nights among the herd. The spot had been an old fairy ground, and the, good people were angry that the scene of their light and airy gambols should be trampled by the rude hoofs of bulls- and cows. The lowing of the cattle sounded sad in their ears, and the chief of the fairies of the hill determined in person to drive away the new comers; and the way she thought of was this. When the harvest nights came on, and the moon shone bright and brilliant over the hill, and the cattle were lying down hushed and quiet, and the herdsman, wrapt in his mantle, was musing with his heart gladdened by the glorious company of the stars twinkling above him, she would come and dance before him, – now in one shape – now in another, but all ugly and frightful to behold. One time she would be a great horse, with the wings of an eagle, and a tail like a dragon, hissing loud and spitting fire. Then in a moment she would change into a little man lame of a leg, with a bull’s head, and a lambent flame playing round it. Then into a great ape, with duck’s feet and a turkey cock’s tail. But I should be all day about it were I to tell you all the shapes she took. And then she would roar, or neigh, or hiss, or bellow, or howl, or hoot, as never yet was roaring, neighing, hissing, bellowing, howling, or hooting, heard in this world before or since. The poor herdsman would cover his face, and call on all the saints for help, but it was no use. With one puff of her breath she would blow away the fold of his great Coat, let him hold it never so tightly over his eyes, and not a saint in heaven paid him the slightest attention. And to make matters worse, he never could stir; no, nor even shut his eyes, but there was obliged to stay, held by what power he knew not, gazing at these terrible sights until the hair of his head would lift his hat half a foot over his crown, and his teeth would be ready to fall out from chattering. But the cattle would scamper about mad, as if they were bitten by the fly; and this would last until the sun rose over the hill.The poor cattle from want of rest were pining away, and food did them no good; besides, they met with accidents without end. Never a night passed that some of them did not fall into a pit, and get maimed, or may be, killed Some would tumble into a river and be drowned: in a word, there seemed never to be an end of the accidents. But what made the matter worse, there could not be a herdsman got to tend the cattle by night. One visit from the fairy drove the stoutest-hearted almost mad. The owner of the ground did not know what to do. He offered double, treble, quadruple wages, but not a man could be found for the sake of money to go through the horror of facing the fairy. She rejoiced at the successful issue of her project, and continued her pranks. The herd gradually thinning, and no man daring to remain on the ground, the fairies came back in numbers, and gambolled as merrily as before, quaffing dew-drops from acorns, and spreading their feast on the heads of capacious mushrooms.What was to be done? the puzzled farmer thought in vain. He found that his substance was daily diminishing, his people terrified, and his rent day coming round. It is no Wonder that he looked gloomy, and walked mournfully down the road. Now in that part of the world dwelt a man of the name of Larry Hoolahan, who played on the pipes better than any other player within fifteen parishes. A roving dashing blade was Larry, and feared nothing. Give him plenty of liquor, and he would defy the devil. He would face a mad bull, or fight single-handed against a fair. In one of his gloomy walks the farmer met him, and on Larry’s asking the cause of his down looks, he told him all his misfortunes. ” If that is all ails you,” said Larry, “make your mind easy. Were there as many fairies on Knocksheogowna as’ there are potato blossoms in Eliogurty, I would face them. It would be a queer thing, indeed, if I, who never was afraid of a proper man, should turn my back upon a brat of a fairy not the bigness of one’s thumb.” ” Larry,” said the farmer, ” do not talk so bold, for you know not who is hearing you; but, if you make your words good, and watch my herds for a week on the top of the mountain, your hand shall be free of my dish till the sun has burnt itself down to the bigness of a farthing rushlight.”The bargain was struck, and Larry went to the hill-top, when the’ moon began to peep over the brow. He had been regaled at the farmer’s house, and was bold with the extract of barley-corn. So he took his seat on a big stone under a hollow of the bill, with his back to the wind, and pulled out his pipes. He had not played long when the voice of the fairies was heard upon the blast, like a slow stream of music. Presently they burst out into a loud laugh, and Larry could plainly hear one say, “What! another man upon the fairies’ ring? Go to him, queen, and make him repent his rashness;” and they flew away. Larry felt them pass by his face as they flew like a swarm of midges; and, looking up hastily, he saw between the moon and him a great black cat, standing on the very tip of its claws, with its back up, and mewing with the voice of a water-mill. Presently it swelled up towards the sky, and, turning round on its left hind leg, whirled till it fell to the ground, from which it started up in the shape of a salmon, with a cravat round its neck, and a pair of new top boots. ” Go on, jewel,” said Larry; “if you dance, I’ll pipe ;” and he struck up. So she turned into this, and that, and the other, but still Larry played on, as he well knew how. At last she lost patience, as ladies will do when you do not mind their scolding, and changed herself into a calf, milk-white as the cream of Cork, and with eyes as mild as those of the girl I love. She came up gentle and fawning, in hopes to throw him off his guard by quietness, and then to work him some wrong. But Larry was not so deceived; for when she came up, he, dropping his pipes, leaped upon her back.Now from the top of Knocksheogowna, as you look westward to the broad Atlantic, you will see the Shannon, queen of rivers, ” spreading like a sea, and running on in gentle course to mingle with the ocean through the fair city of Limerick. It on this night shone under the moon, and looked beautiful from the distant hill. Fifty boats were gliding up and down on the sweet current, and the song of the fishermen rose gaily from the shore. Larry, as I said before, leaped upon the back of the fairy, and she, rejoiced at the opportunity, sprung from the hill-top, and bounded clear, at one jump, over the Shannon, flowing as it was just ten miles from the mountain’s base. It was done in a second, and when 8he alighted on the distant bank, kicking up her heels, she flung Larry on the soft turf. No sooner was he thus planted, than he looked her straight in the face, and scratching his head, cried out, “By my word, well done! that was not a bad leap for a calf!”She looked at him for a moment, and then assumed her own shape. “Laurence,” said she, “you are a bold fellow; will you come back the way you went?” “And that’s what I will,” said he, “if you let me.” So changing to a calf again, again Larry got on her back, and at another bound they were again upon the top of Knocksheogowna. The fairy once more resuming her figure, addressed him: “You have shown so much courage, Laurence,” said she, “that while ‘you keep herds on this hill you never shall be molested by me or mine. The day dawns, go down to the farmer, and tell him this; and if any thing I can do may be of service to you, ask and you shall have it.” She vanished accordingly; and kept her word in never visiting the hill during Larry’s life: but he never troubled her with requests. He piped and drank at the farmer’s expense, and roosted in his chimney corner, occasionally casting an eye to the flock. He died at last,’ and is buried in a green valley of pleasant Tipperary: but whether the fairies returned to the hill of Knocksheogown after his death is more than I can say.","['outa', 'last',

2517,irish,The Young Piper,"There lived not long since, on the borders of the county Tipperary, a decent honest couple, whose names were Mick Flanigan andJudy Muldoon. These poor people were blessed, as the saying is, with four children, all boys: three of them were as fine, stout, healthy, good-looking children as ever the sun shone upon; and it was enough to make any Irishman proud of the breed of his countrymen to see them about one o’clock on a fine summer’s day standing at their father’s cabin door, with their beautiful flaxen hair hanging in curls about their heads, and their cheeks like two rosy apples, and a big laughing potato smoking in their hand. A proud man was Mick of these fine children, and a proud woman, too, was Judy; and reason enough they had to he so. But it was far otherwise with the remaining one, which was the third eldest: he was the most miserable, ugly, ill conditioned brat that ever God put life into: he was so ill-thriven, that he never was able to stand alone, or to leave his cradle; he had long, shaggy, matted, curled hair, as black as any raven; his face was of a greenish yellow colour; his eyes were like two burning coals, and were for ever moving in his head, as if they had the perpetual motion. Before he was a twelvemonth old, he had a mouth full of great teeth; his hands were like kites claws, and his legs were no thicker than the handle of a whip, and about as straight as a reaping-hook: to make the matter worse, he had the gut of a cormorant, and the whinge, and the yelp, and the screech, and the yowl, was never out of his mouth. The neighbours all suspected that he was something not right, particularly as it was observed, when people, as they do in the country, got about the fire, and began to talk of religion and good things, the brat, as he lay in the cradle, which his mother generally put near the fire-place that he might be snug, used to sit up, as they were in the middle of their talk, and begin to bellow as if the devil was in him in right earnest: this, as I said, led the neighbours to think that all was not right, and there was a general consultation held one day about what would he best to do with him. Some advised to put him out on the shovel, but Judy’s pride was up at that. A pretty thing indeed, that a child of hers should be put on a shovel and flung out on the dunghill, just like a dead kitten, or a poisoned rat ! no, no, she would not hear to that at all. One old woman, who was considered very skilful and knowing in fairy matters, strongly recommended her to put the tongs in the fire, and heat them red hot, and to take his nose in them, and that that would, beyond all manner of doubt, make him tell what he was, and where he came from (for the general suspicion was, that he had been changed by the good people); but Judy was too soft-hearted, and too fond of the imp, so she would not give into this plan, though every body said she was wrong; and may be she was, but it’s hard to blame a mother. Well, some advised one thing, and some another; at last one spoke of sending for the priest, who was a very holy and a very learned man, to see it; to this Judy of course had no objection, but one thing or other always prevented her doing so; and the upshot of the business was, that the priest never saw him.Things went on in the old way for some time longer. The brat continued yelping and yowling, and eating more than his three brothers put together, and playing all sorts of unlucky tricks, for he was mighty mischievous]y inclined; till it happened one day that Tim Carrol, the blind piper, going his rounds, called in and sat down by the fire to have a bit of chat with the woman of the house. So after some time, Tim, who was no churl of his music, yoked on the pipes, and began to bellows away in high style; when the instant he began, the young fellow, who had been lying as still as a mouse in his cradle, sat up, began to grin and twist his ugly face, to swing about his long tawny arms, and to kick out his crooked legs, and to show signs of great glee at the music. At last nothing would serve him but he should get the pipes into his own hands, and to humour him, his mother asked Tim to lend them to the child for a minute. Tim, who was kind to children, readily consented and as Tim had not his sight, Judy herself brought them to the cradle, and went to put them on him; but she had no occasion, for the youth seemed quite up to the business. He buckled on the pipes, set the bellows under one arm, and the bag under the other, worked them both as knowingly as if he had been twenty years at the business, and lilted up Sheela na guira, in the finest style imaginable. All was in astonishment: the poor woman crossed herself. Tim, who, as I said before, was dark, and did not well know who was playing, was in great delight; and when he heard that it was a little prechan not five years old, that had never seen a set of pipes in his life, he wished the mother joy of her son; offered to take him off her hands if she would part with him, swore he was a born piper, a natural genus, and declared that in a little time more, with the help of a little good instruction from himself, there would not be his match in the whole country. The poor woman was greatly delighted to hear all this, particularly as what Tim said about natural genus quieted some misgivings that were rising in her mind, lest what the neighbours said about his not being right might he too true; and it gratified her moreover to think that her dear child (for she really loved the whelp) would not he forced to turn out and beg, but might earn decent bread for himself. So when Mick came home in the evening from his work, she up and told him all that had happened, and all that Tim Carrol had said; and Mick, as was natural, was very glad to hear it, for the helpless condition of the poor creature was a great trouble to him; so next day he took the pig to the fair, and with what it brought set off to Clonmel, and bespoke a bran new set of pipes, of the proper size for him. In about a fortnight the pipes came home, and the moment the chap in his cradle laid eyes on them, he squealed with delight, and threw up his pretty legs, and bumped himself in his cradle, and went on with a great many comical tricks; till at last, to quiet him, they gave him the pipes, and he immediately set to and pulled away at Jig Polthog, to the admiration of all that heard him. The fame of his skill on the pipes soon spread far and near, for there was not a piper in the six next counties could come at all near him, in Old Moderagh rue, or the Hare in the Corn, or The Foxhunter Jig, or The Rakes of Cashel, or the Piper’s Maggot, or any of the fine Irish jigs, which make people dance whether they will or no and it was surprising to hear him rattle away ” The Fox-hunt; ” you’d really think you heard the hounds giving tongue, and the terriers yelping always behind, and the huntsman and the whippers-in cheering or correcting the dogs; it was, in short, the very next thing to seeing the hunt itself. The best of him was, he was no ways stingy of his music, and many a merry dance the boys and girls of the neighbourhood used to have in his father’s cabin; and he would play up music for them, that they said used as it were to put quicksilver in their feet; and they all declared they never moved so light and so airy to any piper’s playing that ever they danced to.But besides all his fine Irish music, he had one queer tune of his own, the oddest that ever was heard ; for the moment he began to play it, every thing in the house seemed disposed to dance; the plates and porringers used to jingle on the dresser, the pots and pot-hooks used to rattle in the chimney, and people used even to fancy they felt the stools moving from under them but, however it might be with the stools, it is certain that no one could keep long sitting on them, for both old and young always fell to capering as hard as ever they could. The girls complained that when he began this tune it always threw them out in their dancing, and that they never could handle their feet rightly, for they felt the floor like ice under them, and themselves every moment ready to come sprawling on their backs or their faces; the young bachelors that wished to show off their dancing and their new pumps, and their bright red or green and yellow garters, swore that it confused them so that they never could go rightly through the heel and toe, or cover the buckle, or any of their best steps, but felt themselves always all bedizzied and bewildered, and then old and young would go jostling and knocking together in a frightful manner; and when the unlucky brat had them all in this way whirligigging about the floor, he’d grin and chuckle and chatter, for all the world like Jacko the monkey when he has played off some of his roguery.The older he grew the worse he grew, and by the time he was six years old there was no standing the house for him; he was always making his brothers burn or scald themselves, or break their shins over the pots and stools. One time in harvest, he was left at home by himself, and when his mother came in, she found the cat a horseback on the dog, with her face to the tail, and her legs tied round him, and the urchin playing his queer tune to them; so that the dog went barking and jumping about, and puss was mewing for the dear life, and slapping her tail backwards and forwards, which as it would hit against the dog’s chaps, he’d snap at and bite, and then there was the philliloo. Another time, the farmer Mick worked with, a very decent respectable man, happened to call in, and Judy wiped a stool with her apron, and invited him to sit down and rest himself after his walk. He was sitting with his back to the cradle, and behind him was a pan of blood, for Judy was making pigs’ puddings; the lad lay quite still in his nest, and watched his opportunity till he got ready a hook at the end of a piece of twine, which he contrived to fling so handily, that it caught in the bob of the man’s nice new wig, and soused it in the pan of blood. Another time, his mother was coming in from milking the cow, with the pail on her head: the minute he saw her lie lilted up his infernal tune, and the poor woman letting go the pail, clapped her hands aside, and began to dance a jig, and tumbled the milk all atop of her husband, who was bringing in some turf to boil the supper. In short there would be no end to telling all his pranks, and all the mischievous tricks he played.They had to cross a river, but as it ran through a bottom between two high banks, you did not see it till you were close on it. The young fellow was lying pretty quiet in the bottom of his cradle, till they came to the head of the bridge, when hearing the roaring of the water (for there was a great flood in the river, as it had rained heavily for the last two or three days), he sat up ih his cradle and looked about him; and the instant he got a sight of the water, and found they were going to take him across it, O how he did bellow and how he did squeal ! -no rat caught in a snap-trap ever sang out equal to him. ” Whisht ! A lanna,” said Judy, ” there’s no fear of you;” sure its only over the stone-bridge we’re going.” “Bad luck to you, you old rip !” cried he, “what a pretty trick you’ve played me, to bring me here !” and still went on yelling, and the farther they got on the bridge the louder he yelled; till at last Mick could hold out no longer, so giving him a great skelp of the whip he had in his hand, “Devil choke you, you brat !” said he, ” will you never stop bawling ? a body can’t hear their ears for you.” The moment he felt the thong of the whip, he leaped up in the cradle, clapt the pipes under his arm, gave a most wicked grin at Mick, and jumped clean over the battlements of the bridge down into the water. ” O my child, my child !” shouted Judy, ” he’s gone for ever from me.” Mick and the rest of the children ran to the other side of the bridge, and looking over, they saw him coming out from under the arch of the bridge, sitting cross-legged on the top of a white-headed wave,and playing away on the pipes as merrily as if nothing had happened. The river was running very rapidly, so he was whirled away at a great rate; but he played as fast, ay and faster than the river ran; and though they set off as hard as they could along the bank, yet, as the river made a sudden turn round the hill, about a hundred yards below the bridge, by the time they got there he was out of sight, and no one ever laid eyes on him more; but the general opinion was, that he went borne with the pipes to his own relations, the good people, to make music for them.","['live', 'farmer', 'three', 'daughter', 'good', 'useful', 'girl', 'work', 'house', 'morning',

2588,irish,The Old Hag's Long Leather Bag,"Once on a time, long, long ago, there was a widow woman who had three daughters. When their father died, their mother thought they never would want, for he had left her a long leather bag filled with gold and silver. But he was not long dead, when an old hag came begging to the house one day and stole the long leather bag filled with gold and silver, and went away out of the country with it, no one knew where.So from that day, the widow woman and her three daughters were poor, and she had a hard struggle to live and to bring up her three daughters.But when they were grown up, the eldest said one day: “Mother, I’m a young woman now, and it’s a shame for me to be here doing nothing to help you or myself. Bake me a bannock and cut me a callop, till I go away to push my fortune.”The mother baked her a whole bannock, and asked her if she would have half of it with her blessing or the whole of it without. She said to give her the whole bannock without.So she took it and went away. She told them if she was not back in a year and a day from that, then they would know she was doing well, and making her fortune.She traveled away and away before her, far further than I could tell you, and twice as far as you could tell me, until she came into a strange country, and going up to a little house, she found an old hag living in it. The hag asked her where she was going. She said she was going to push her fortune.Said the hag: “How would you like to stay here with me, for I want a maid?”“What will I have to do?” said she.“You will have to wash me and dress me, and sweep the hearth clean; but on the peril of your life, never look up the chimney,” said the hag.“All right,” she agreed to this.The next day, when the hag arose, she washed her and dressed her, and when the hag went out, she swept the hearth clean, and she thought it would be no harm to have one wee look up the chimney. And there what did she see but her own mother’s long leather bag of gold and silver? So she took it down at once, and getting it on her back, started for home as fast as she could run.But she had not gone far when she met a horse grazing in a field, and when he saw her, he said: “Rub me! Rub me! for I haven’t been rubbed these seven years.”But she only struck him with a stick she had in her hand, and drove him out of her way.She had not gone much further when she met a sheep, who said “O, shear me! Shear me! for I haven’t been shorn these seven years.”But she struck the sheep, and sent it scurrying out of her way.She had not gone much further when she met a goat tethered, and he said: “O, change my tether! Change my tether! for it hasn’t been changed these seven years.”But she flung a stone at him, and went on.Next she came to a lime-kiln, and it said: “O, clean me! Clean me! for I haven’t been cleaned these seven years.”But she only scowled at it, and hurried on.After another bit she met a cow, and it said:“O, milk me! Milk me! for I haven’t been milked these seven years.”She struck the cow out of her way, and went on.Then she came to a mill. The mill said: “O, turn me! Turn me! for I haven’t been turned these seven years.”But she did not heed what it said, only went in and lay down behind the mill door, with the bag under her head, for it was then night.When the hag came into her hut again and found the girl gone, she ran to the chimney and looked up to see if she had carried off the bag. She got into a great rage, and she started to run as fast as she could after her.She had not gone far when she met the horse, and she said: “O, horse, horse of mine, did you see this maid of mine, with my tig, with my tag, with my long leather bag, and all the gold and silver I have earned since I was a maid?”“Ay,” said the horse, “it is not long since she passed here.”So on she ran, and it was not long till she met the sheep, and said she: “Sheep, sheep of mine, did you see this maid of mine, with my tig, with my tag, with my long leather bag, and all the gold and silver I have earned since I was a maid?”“Ay,” said the sheep, “it is not long since she passed here.”So she goes on, and it was not long before she met the goat, and said she: “Goat, goat of mine, did you see this maid of mine, with my tig, with my tag, with my long leather bag, and all the gold and silver I have earned since I was a maid?”“Ay,” said the goat, “it is not long since she passed here.”So she goes on, and it was not long before she met the lime-kiln, and said she: “Lime-kiln, lime-kiln of mine, did you see this maid of mine, with my tig, with my tag, with my long leather bag, and with all the gold and silver I have earned since I was a maid?”“Ay,” said the lime-kiln, “it is not long since she passed here.”So she goes on, and it was not long before she met the cow, and said she, “Cow, cow of mine, did you see this maid of mine, with my tig, with my tag, with my long leather bag, and all the gold and silver I have earned since I was a maid?”“Ay,” said the cow, “it is not long since she passed here.”So she goes on, and it was not long before she met the mill, and said she: “Mill, mill of mine, did you see this maid of mine, with my tig, with my tag, with my long leather bag, and all the gold and silver I have earned since I was a maid?”And the mill said: “Yes, she is sleeping behind the door.”She went in and struck her with a white rod, and turned her into a stone. She then took the bag of gold and silver on her back, and went away back home.A year and a day had gone by after the eldest daughter left home, and when they found she had not returned, the second daughter got up, and said: “My sister must be doing well and making her fortune, and isn’t it a shame for me to be sitting here doing nothing, either to help you, mother, or myself. Bake me a bannock,” said she, “and cut me a callop, till I go away to push my fortune.”The mother did this, and asked her would she have half the bannock with her blessing or the whole bannock without.She said the whole bannock without, and she set off. Then she said: “If I am not back here in a year and a day, you may be sure that I am doing well and making my fortune,” and then she went away.She traveled away and away on before her, far further than I could tell you, and twice as far as you could tell me, until she came into a strange country, and going up to a little house, she found an old Hag living in it. The old Hag asked her where she was going. She said she was going to push her fortune.Said the hag: “How would you like to stay here with me, for I want a maid?”“What will I have to do?” says she.“You’ll have to wash me and dress me, and sweep the hearth clean; and on the peril of your life never look up the chimney,” said the hag.“All right,” she agreed to this.The next day, when the hag arose, she washed her and dressed her, and when the hag went out she swept the hearth, and she thought it would be no harm to have one wee look up the chimney. And there what did she see but her own mother’s long leather bag of gold and silver? So she took it down at once, and getting it on her back, started away for home as fast as she could run.But she had not gone far when she met a horse grazing in a field, and when he saw her, he said: “Rub me! Rub me! for I haven’t been rubbed these seven years.”But she only struck him with a stick she had in her hand, and drove him out of her way.She had not gone much further when she met the sheep, who said: “O, shear me! Shear me! for I haven’t been shorn in seven years.”But she struck the sheep, and sent it scurrying out of her way.She had not gone much further when she met the goat tethered, and he said: “O, change my tether! Change my tether! for it hasn’t been changed in seven years.”But she flung a stone at him, and went on.Next she came to the lime-kiln, and that said: “O, clean me! Clean me! for I haven’t been cleaned these seven years.”But she only scowled at it, and hurried on.Then she came to the cow, and it said: “O, milk me! Milk me! for I haven’t been milked these seven years.”She struck the cow out of her way, and went on.Then she came to the mill. The mill said: “O, turn me! Turn me! for I haven’t been turned these seven years.”But she did not heed what it said, only went in and lay down behind the mill door, with the bag under her head, for it was then night.When the hag came into her hut again and found the girl gone, she ran to the chimney and looked up to see if she had carried off the bag. She got into a great rage, and she started to run as fast as she could after her.She had not gone far when she met the horse, and she said: “O, horse, horse of mine, did you see this maid of mine, with my tig, with my tag, with my long leather bag, and all the gold and silver I have earned since I was a maid?”“Ay,” said the horse, “it is not long since she passed here.”So on she ran, and it was not long until she met the sheep, and said she: “Oh, sheep, sheep of mine, did you see this maid of mine, with my tig, with my tag, with my long leather bag, and all the gold and silver I have earned since I was a maid?”“Ay,” said the sheep, “it is not long since she passed here.”So she goes on, and it was not long before she met the goat, and said: “Goat, goat of mine, did you see this maid of mine, with my tig, with my tag, with my long leather bag, and all the gold and silver I have earned since I was a maid?”“Ay,” said the goat, “it is not long since she passed here.”So she goes on, and it was not long before she met the lime-kiln, and said she: “Lime-kiln, lime-kiln of mine, did you see this maid of mine, with my tig, with my tag, with my long leather bag, and all the gold and silver I have earned since I was a maid?”“Ay,” said the lime-kiln, “it is not long since she passed here.”So she goes on, and it was not long before she met the cow, and says she: “Cow, cow of mine, did you see this maid of mine, with my tig, with my tag, with my long leather bag, and all the gold and silver I have earned since I was a maid?”“Ay,” said the cow, “it is not long since she passed here.”So she goes on, and it was not long before she met the mill, and said she: “Mill, mill of mine, did you see this maid of mine, with my tig, with my tag, with my long leather bag, and all the gold and silver I have earned since I was a maid?”And the mill said: “Yes, she is sleeping behind the door.”She went in and struck her with a white rod, and turned her into a stone. She then took the bag of gold and silver on her back and went home.When the second daughter had been gone a year and a day and she hadn’t come back, the youngest daughter said: “My two sisters must be doing very well indeed, and making great fortunes when they are not coming back, and it’s a shame for me to be sitting here doing nothing, either to help you, mother, or myself. Make me a bannock and cut me a callop, till I go away and push my fortune.”The mother did this and asked her would she have half of the bannock with her blessing or the whole bannock without.She said: “I will have half of the bannock with your blessing, mother.”The mother gave her a blessing and half a bannock, and she set out.She traveled away and away on before her, far further than I could tell you, and twice as far as you could tell me, until she came into a strange country, and going up to a little house, she found an old hag living in it. The hag asked her where she was going. She said she was going to push her fortune.Said the hag: “How would you like to stay here with me, for I want a maid?”“What will I have to do?” said she.“You’ll have to wash me and dress me, and sweep the hearth clean; and on the peril of your life never look up the chimney,” said the hag.“All right,” she agreed to this.The next day when the hag arose, she washed her and dressed her, and when the hag went out she swept the hearth, and she thought it would be no harm to have one wee look up the chimney, and there what did she see but her own mother’s long leather bag of gold and silver? So she took it down at once, and getting it on her back, started away for home as fast as she could run.When she got to the horse, the horse said: “Rub me! Rub me! for I haven’t been rubbed these seven years.”“Oh, poor horse, poor horse,” she said, “I’ll surely do that.” And she laid down her bag, and rubbed the horse.Then she went on, and it wasn’t long before she met the sheep, who said: “Oh, shear me, shear me! for I haven’t been shorn these seven years.”“O, poor sheep, poor sheep,” she said, “I’ll surely do that,” and she laid down the bag, and sheared the sheep.On she went till she met the goat, who said: “O, change my tether! Change my tether! for it hasn’t been changed these seven years.”“O, poor goat, poor goat,” she said, “I’ll surely do that,” and she laid down the bag, and changed the goat’s tether.Then she went on till she met the lime-kiln. The lime-kiln said: “O, clean me! clean me! for I haven’t been cleaned these seven years.”“O, poor lime-kiln, poor lime-kiln,” she said, “I’ll surely do that,” and she laid down the bag and cleaned the lime-kiln.Then she went on and met the cow. The cow said: “O, milk me! Milk me! for I haven’t been milked these seven years.”“O, poor cow, poor cow,” she said, “I’ll surely do that,” and she laid down the bag and milked the cow.At last she reached the mill. The mill said: “O, turn me! turn me! for I haven’t been turned these seven years.”“O, poor mill, poor mill,” she said, “I’ll surely do that,” and she turned the mill too.As night was on her, she went in and lay down behind the mill door to sleep.When the hag came into her hut again and found the girl gone, she ran to the chimney to see if she had carried off the bag. She got into a great rage, and started to run as fast as she could after her.She had not gone far until she came up to the horse and said: “O, horse, horse of mine, did you see this maid of mine, with my tig, with my tag, with my long leather bag, and all the gold and silver I have earned since I was a maid?”The horse said: “Do you think I have nothing to do only watch your maids for you? You may go somewhere else and look for information.”Then she came upon the sheep. “O, sheep, sheep of mine, have you seen this maid of mine, with my tig, with my tag, with my long leather bag, and all the gold and silver I have earned since I was a maid?”The sheep said: “Do you think I have nothing to do only watch your maids for you? You may go somewhere else and look for information.”Then she went on till she met the goat. “O, goat, goat of mine, have you seen this maid of mine, with my tig, with my tag, with my long leather bag, and all the gold and silver I have earned since I was a maid?”The goat said: “Do you think I have nothing to do only watch your maids for you? You can go somewhere else and look for information.”Then she went on till she came to the lime-kiln. “O, lime-kiln, lime-kiln of mine, did you see this maid of mine, with my tig, with my tag, with my long leather bag, and all the gold and silver I have earned since I was a maid?”Said the lime-kiln: “Do you think I have nothing to do only watch your maids for you? You may go somewhere else and look for information.”Next she met the cow. “O, cow, cow of mine, have you seen this maid of mine, with my tig, with my tag, with my long leather bag, and all the gold and silver I have earned since I was a maid?”The cow said: “Do you think I have nothing to do only watch your maids for you? You may go somewhere else and look for information.”Then she got to the mill. “O, mill, mill of mine, have you seen this maid of mine, with my tig, with my tag, with my long leather bag, and all the gold and silver I have earned since I was a maid?”The mill said: “Come nearer and whisper to me.”She went nearer to whisper to the mill, and the mill dragged her under the wheels and ground her up.The old hag had dropped the white rod out of her hand, and the mill told the young girl to take this white rod and strike two stones behind the mill door. She did that, and her two sisters stood up. She hoisted the leather bag on her back, and the three of them set out and traveled away and away till they reached home.The mother had been crying all the time while they were away, and was now ever so glad to see them, and rich and happy they all lived ever after.","['adjoin', 'village', 'live', 'famous', 'call', 'mighty-of-his-mouth', 'could', 'accomplish', 'wonder', 'word', 'alone', 'call',

2685,irish,Oisin in Tir na n-Og,"There was a king in Tir na n-Og (the land of Youth) who held the throne and crown for many a year against all comers; and the law of the kingdom was that every seventh year the champions and best men of the country should run for the office of king.Once in seven years they all met at the front of the palace and ran to the top of a hill two miles distant. On the top of that hill was a chair and the man that sat first in the chair was king of Tir na n-Og for the next seven years. After he had ruled for ages, the king became anxious; he was afraid that some one might sit in the chair before him, and take the crown off his head. So he called up his Druid one day and asked: “How long shall I keep the chair to rule this land, and will any man sit in it before me and take the crown off my head?”“You will keep the chair and the crown forever,” said the Druid, “unless your own son-in-law takes them from you.”The king had no sons and but one daughter, the finest woman in Tir na n-Og; and the like of her could not be found in Erin or any kingdom in the world. When the king heard the words of the Druid, he said, “I’ll have no son-in-law, for I’ll put the daughter in a way no man will marry her.”Then he took a rod of Druidic spells, and calling the daughter up before him, he struck her with the rod, and put a pig’s head on her in place of her own. Then he sent the daughter away to her own place in the castle, and turning to the Druid said: “There is no man that will marry her now.”When the Druid saw the face that was on the princess with the pig’s head that the father gave her, he grew very sorry that he had given such information to the king; and some time after he went to see the princess.“Must I be in this way forever?” asked she of the Druid.“You must,” said he, “till you marry one of the sons of Fin MacCumhail in Erin. If you marry one of Fin’s sons, you’ll be freed from the blot that is on you now, and get back your own head and countenance.”When she heard this she was impatient in her mind, and could never rest till she left Tir na n-Og and came to Erin. When she had inquired she heard that Fin and the Fenians of Erin were at that time living on Knock an Ar, and she made her way to the place without delay and lived there a while; and when she saw Oisin, he pleased her; and when she found out that he was a son of Fin MacCumhail, she was always making up to him and coming towards him. And it was usual for the Fenians in those days to go out hunting on the hills and mountains and in the woods of Erin, and when one of them went he always took five or six men with him to bring home the game.On a day Oisin set out with his men and dogs to the woods; and he went so far and killed so much game that when it was brought together, the men were so tired, weak, and hungry that they couldn’t carry it, but went away home and left him with the three dogs, Bran, Sciolán, and Buglén, to shift for himself.Now the daughter of the king of Tir na n-Og, who was herself the queen of Youth, followed closely in the hunt all that day, and when the men left Oisin she came up to him; and as he stood looking at the great pile of game and said, “I am very sorry to leave behind anything that I’ve had the trouble of killing,” she looked at him and said, “Tie up a bundle for me, and I’ll carry it to lighten the load off you.”Oisin gave her a bundle of the game to carry, and took the remainder himself. The evening was very warm and the game heavy, and after they had gone some distance, Oisin said, “Let us rest a while.” Both threw down their burdens, and put their backs against a great stone that was by the roadside. The woman was heated and out of breath, and opened her dress to cool herself. Then Oisin looked at her and saw her beautiful form and her white bosom.“Oh, then,” said he, “it’s a pity you have the pig’s head on you; for I have never seen such an appearance on a woman in all my life before.”“Well,” said she, “my father is the king of Tir na n-Og, and I was the finest woman in his kingdom and the most beautiful of all, till he put me under a Druidic spell and gave me the pig’s head that’s on me now in place of my own. And the Druid of Tir na n-Og came to me afterwards, and told me that if one of the sons of Fin MacCumhail would marry me, the pig’s head would vanish, and I should get back my face in the same form as it was before my father struck me with the Druid’s wand. When I heard this I never stopped till I came to Erin, where I found your father and picked you out among the sons of Fin MacCumhail, and followed you to see would you marry me and set me free.”“If that is the state you are in, and if marriage with me will free you from the spell, I’ll not leave the pig’s head on you long.”So they got married without delay, not waiting to take home the game or to lift it from the ground. That moment the pig’s head was gone, and the king’s daughter had the same face and beauty that she had before her father struck her with the Druidic wand.“Now,” said the queen of Youth to Oisin, “I cannot stay here long, and unless you come with me to Tir na n-Og we must part.”“Oh,” said Oisin, “wherever you go I’ll go, and wherever you turn I’ll follow.”Then she turned and Oisin went with her, not going back to Knock an Ar to see his father or his son. That very day they set out for Tir na n-Og and never stopped till they came to her father’s castle; and when they came, there was a welcome before them, for the king thought his daughter was lost. That same year there was to be a choice of a king, and when the appointed day came at the end of the seventh year all the great men and the champions, and the king himself, met together at the front of the castle to run and see who should be first in the chair on the hill; but before a man of them was halfway to the hill, Oisin was sitting above in the chair before them. After that time no one stood up to run for the office against Oisin, and he spent many a happy year as king in Tir na n-Og. At last he said to his wife: “I wish I could be in Erin to-day to see my father and his men.”“If you go,” said his wife, “and set foot on the land of Erin, you’ll never come back here to me, and you’ll become a blind old man. How long do you think it is since you came here?”“About three years,” said Oisin. “It is three hundred years,” said she, “since you came to this kingdom with me. If you must go to Erin, I’ll give you this white steed to carry you; but if you come down from the steed or touch the soil of Erin with your foot, the steed will come back that minute, and you’ll be where he left you, a poor old man.”“I’ll come back, never fear,” said Oisin. “Have I not good reason to come back? But I must see my father and my son and my friends in Erin once more; I must have even one look at them.”She prepared the steed for Oisin and said, “This steed will carry you wherever you wish to go.”Oisin never stopped till the steed touched the soil of Erin; and he went on till he came to Knock Patrick in Munster, where he saw a man herding cows. In the field, where the cows were grazing there was a broad flat stone.“Will you come here,” said Oisin to the herdsman, “and turn over this stone?”“Indeed, then, I will not,” said the herdsman; “for I could not lift it, nor twenty men more like me.”Oisin rode up to the stone, and, reaching down, caught it with his hand and turned it over. Underneath the stone was the great horn of the Fenians (borabu), which circled round like a seashell, and it was the rule that when any of the Fenians of Erin blew the borabu, the others would assemble at once from whatever part of the country they might be in at the time.“Will you bring this horn to me!” asked Oisin of the herdsman.“I will not,” said the herdsman; “for neither I nor many more like me could raise it from the ground.” With that Oisin moved near the horn, and reaching down took it in his hand; but so eager was he to blow it, that he forgot everything, and slipped in reaching till one foot touched the earth. In an instant the steed was gone, and Oisin lay on the ground a blind old man. The herdsman went to Saint Patrick, who lived near by, and told him what had happened.Saint Patrick sent a man and a horse for Oisin, brought him to his own house, gave him a room by himself, and sent a boy to stay with him to serve and take care of him. And Saint Patrick commanded his cook to send Oisin plenty of meat and drink, to give him bread and beef and butter every day.Now Oisin lived a while in this way. The cook sent him provisions each day, and Saint Patrick himself asked him all kinds of questions about the old times of the Fenians of Erin. Oisin told him about his father, Fin MacCumhail, about himself, his son Osgar, Goll MacMorna, Conan Maol, Diarmuid, and all the Fenian heroes; how they fought, feasted, and hunted, how they came under Druidic spells, and how they were freed from them.At the same time, Saint Patrick was putting up a great building; but what his men used to put up in the daytime was levelled at night, and Saint Patrick lamented over his losses in the hearing of Oisin. Then Oisin said in the hearing of Saint Patrick, “If I had my strength and my sight, I’d put a stop to the power that is levelling your work.”“Do you think you’d be able to do that,” said Saint Patrick, “and let my building go on?”“I do, indeed,” said Oisin. So Saint Patrick prayed to the Lord, and the sight and strength came back to Oisin. He went to the woods and got a great club and stood at the building on guard.What should come in the night but a great beast in the form of a bull, which began to uproot and destroy the work. But if he did Oisin faced him, and the battle began hot and heavy between the two; but in the course of the night Oisin got the upper hand of the bull and left him dead before the building. Then he stretched out on the ground himself and fell asleep.Now Saint Patrick was waiting at home to know how would the battle come out, and thinking Oisin too long away he sent a messenger to the building; and when the messenger came he saw the ground torn up, a hill in one place and a hollow in the next. The bull was dead and Oisin sleeping after the desperate battle. He went back and told what he saw.“Oh,” said Saint Patrick, “it’s better to knock the strength out of him again; for he’ll kill us all if he gets vexed.”Saint Patrick took the strength out of him, and when Oisin woke up he was a blind old man and the messenger went out and brought him home.Oisin lived on for a time as before. The cook sent him his food, the boy served him, and Saint Patrick listened to the stories of the Fenians of Erin.Saint Patrick had a neighbor, a Jew, a very rich man but the greatest miser in the kingdom, and he had the finest haggart of corn in Erin. Well, the Jew and Saint Patrick got very intimate with one another and so great became the friendship of the Jew for Saint Patrick at last, that he said he’d give him, for the support of his house, as much corn as one man could thrash out of the haggart in a day.When Saint Patrick went home after getting the promise of the corn, he told in the hearing of Oisin about what the Jew had said.“Oh, then,” said Oisin, “if I had my sight and strength, I’d thrash as much corn in one day as would do your whole house for a twelvemonth and more.”“Will you do that for me?” said Saint Patrick.“I will,” said Oisin.Saint Patrick prayed again to the Lord, and the sight and strength came back to Oisin. He went to the woods next morning at daybreak, Oisin did, pulled up two fine ash-trees and made a flail of them. After eating his breakfast he left the house and never stopped till he faced the haggart of the Jew. Standing before one of the stacks of wheat he hit it a wallop of his flail and broke it asunder. He kept on in this way till he slashed the whole haggart to and fro,—and the Jew running like mad up and down the highroad in front of the haggart, tearing the hair from his head when he saw what was doing to his wheat, and the face gone from him entirely he was so in dread of Oisin.When the haggart was thrashed clean, Oisin went to Saint Patrick and told him to send his men for the wheat; for he had thrashed out the whole haggart. When Saint Patrick saw the countenance that was on Oisin, and heard what he had done he was greatly in dread of him, and knocked the strength out of him again, and Oisin became an old, blind man as before.Saint Patrick’s men went to the haggart and there was so much wheat they didn’t bring the half of it away with them and they didn’t want it.Oisin again lived for a while as before and then he was vexed because the cook didn’t give him what he wanted. He told Saint Patrick that he wasn’t getting enough to eat. Then Saint Patrick called up the cook before himself and Oisin and asked her what she was giving Oisin to eat. She said: “I give him at every meal what bread is baked on a large griddle and all the butter I make in one churn, and a quarter of beef besides.”“That ought to be enough for you,” said Saint Patrick.“You lie!” said the cook, “you never did.”Oisin said not a word in answer.Now there was a hound in the place that was going to have her first whelps, and Oisin said to the boy who was tending him: “Do you mind and get the first whelp she’ll have and drown the others.”Next morning the boy found three whelps, and coming back to Oisin, said: “There are three whelps and ’tis unknown which of them is the first.”At Saint Patrick’s house they had slaughtered an ox the day before, and Oisin said: “Go now and bring the hide of the ox and hang it up in this room.” When the hide was hung up Oisin said, “Bring here the three whelps and throw them up against the hide.” The boy threw up one of the whelps against the oxhide. “What did he do?” asked Oisin.“What did he do,” said the boy, “but fall to the ground.”“Throw up another,” said Oisin. The boy threw another. “What did he do?” asked Oisin.“What did he do but to fall the same as the first.”The third whelp was thrown and he held fast to the hide,—didn’t fall. “What did he do?” asked Oisin.“Oh,” said the boy, “he kept his hold.”“Take him down,” said Oisin; “give him to the mother: bring both in here; feed the mother well and drown the other two.”The boy did as he was commanded, and fed the two well, and when the whelp grew up the mother was banished, the whelp chained up and fed for a year and a day. And when the year and a day were spent, Oisin said, “We’ll go hunting to-morrow, and we’ll take the dog with us.”They went next day, the boy guiding Oisin, holding the dog by a chain. They went first to the place where Oisin had touched earth and lost the magic steed from Tir na n-Og. The borabu of the Fenians of Erin was lying on the ground there still. Oisin took it up and they went on to Glen na Smuil (Thrush’s Glen). When at the edge of the glen Oisin began to sound the borabu. Birds and beasts of every kind came hurrying forward. He blew the horn till the glen was full of them from end to end.“What do you see now?” asked he of the boy.“The glen is full of living things.”“What is the dog doing?” “He is looking ahead and his hair is on end.”“Do you see anything else?”“I see a great bird all black settling down on the north side of the glen.”“That’s what I want,” said Oisin; “what is the dog doing now?”“Oh, the eyes are coming out of his head, and there isn’t a rib of hair on his body that isn’t standing up.”“Let him go now,” said Oisin. The boy let slip the chain and the dog rushed through the glen killing everything before him. When all the others were dead he turned to the great blackbird and killed that. Then he faced Oisin and the boy and came bounding toward them with venom and fierceness. Oisin drew out of his bosom a brass ball and said: “If you don’t throw this into the dog’s mouth he’ll destroy us both; knock the dog with the ball or he’ll tear us to pieces.”“Oh,” said the boy, “I’ll never be able to throw the ball, I’m so in dread of the dog.”“Come here at my back, then,” said Oisin, “and straighten my hand towards the dog.” The boy directed the hand and Oisin threw the ball into the dog’s mouth and killed him on the spot.“What have we done?” asked Oisin.“Oh, the dog is knocked,” said the boy.“We are all right then,” said Oisin, “and do you lead me now to the blackbird of the carn, I don’t care for the others.”They went to the great bird, kindled a fire and cooked all except one of its legs. Then Oisin ate as much as he wanted and said; “I’ve had a good meal of my own hunting and it’s many and many a day since I have had one. Now let us go on farther.” They went into the woods, and soon Oisin asked the boy; “Do you see anything wonderful?”“I see an ivy with the largest leaves I have ever set eyes on.”“Take one leaf of that ivy,” said Oisin.The boy took the leaf. Near the ivy they found a rowan berry, and then went home taking the three things with them,—the blackbird’s leg, the ivy leaf, and the rowan berry. When they reached the house Oisin called for the cook, and Saint Patrick made her come to the fore. When she came Oisin pointed to the blackbird’s leg and asked, “Which is larger, that leg or the quarter of beef you give me?”“Oh, that is a deal larger,” said the cook.“You were right in that case,” said Saint Patrick to Oisin.Then Oisin drew out the ivy leaf and asked, “Which is larger, this or the griddle on which you made bread for me?”“That is larger than the griddle and the bread together,” said the cook.“Right again,” said Saint Patrick.Oisin now took out the rowan berry and asked: “Which is larger, this berry or the butter of one churning which you give me?”“Oh, that is bigger,” said the cook, “than both the churn and the butter.”“Right, every time,” said Saint Patrick.Then Oisin raised his arm and swept the head off the cook with a stroke from the edge of his hand, saying, “You’ll never give the lie to an honest man again.”","['merry', 'poor', 'hostler', 'salamanca', 'poor', 'business', 'attend', 'richly', 'caparison', 'mule', 'belonging', 'archbishop', 'toledo',

2693,irish,Fin MacCumhail and the Knight of the Full Axe,"There was a day when Fin went on an expedition by himself. He walked out to his currochán on the seashore, gave it a kick that sent it out nine leagues from land, then with a spring he jumped into the boat and rowed over the sea.After he had gone some distance he saw a giant coming towards him, walking through the water, which did not reach his knees. Looking up, Fin could see nothing between the head of the giant and the sky.With one step the giant was in front of Fin, and it seemed that he and his boat would be lost in a moment between the legs of the terrible monster.“Poor, little helpless creature! what brings you here in my way?” asked the giant. He was just going to lay hold of the boat and toss it far off to one side, when Fin called out:“Won’t you give fair play; just let me put foot on solid land, and see what will happen. Don’t attack me here; I’m not afraid to meet you once I have earth for my two feet to stand on.”“If that is all you want I can take you to land very soon.” And seizing the boat as he would a grass-blade, the giant drew it to the shore of the sea opposite to that from which Fin started, and in front of his own castle. “What will you do now?” asked the giant.“I’ll fight with you,” said Fin.The giant brought out his battle-axe, which had a blade seven acres in size. Fin was ready with his sword, and now began a most terrible battle.Fin faced the giant, slashing at him with his sword, and when the giant made an offer of the axe at him, Fin would dart to one side; and when the axe missing him struck the ground, it went into the handle. The giant was a long time striving to know could he draw out the axe; and while at this Fin ran behind and cut steps with his sword into the leg of his enemy; and by the time the giant had the axe out of the ground, Fin was ready for him again and in front of him, striking and vexing him with his sword. It was another long while till a blow came down; and when the axe went into the ground again, Fin ran behind a second time, cut more steps in the leg and body of the giant, so as to reach his neck and cut the head off him.When the axe was coming to the ground the third time, Fin slipped and fell under one corner of it, and between the feet of the giant, who closed his legs with a clap that was heard to the end of the Western World. He thought to catch Fin; but Fin was too quick for him, and though badly hurt he was able to cut more steps and climb to the neck of the giant. With one blow he swept the head off him,—and a big head it was; by all accounts as broad as the moon.The battle was fought in front of the giant’s castle. Fin was terribly wounded; the axe had cut that deep that his bowels were to be seen. He dropped at the side of the giant, and lay helpless on the ground. After the fall of the giant twelve women came out of his castle, and when they drew near and saw him dead they laughed from joy; but seeing Fin with his wound they began to mourn.“Oh, then,” said Fin, “is it making sport of me you are after the evil day that I’ve had?”“Indeed it is not. We are twelve daughters of kings, stolen from our fathers. We saw the giant fall, and came here to look at him dead; we grieve for you and mourn for the sorrow that is on you, but we are so glad the giant is killed that we cannot help laughing.”“Well,” said Fin, “if you mourn for me and are glad that I have killed the giant, will you carry me to my currochán, lay me in it, and push it out to sea? The waves may bear me home, and I care for nothing else if only one day my bones may come to land in Erin.”The twelve women took him up carefully and put him in the boat, and when the tide came they pushed it out to sea.Fin lay in the bottom of the boat barely alive. It floated along, and he was borne over the waves. Hither and thither went the boat, till at last one day a blackbird came down on the body of Fin MacCumhail, and began to pick at his entrails. The blackbird said:“Many a long day have I watched and waited for this chance, and glad am I to have it now.”That moment the blackbird turned into a little man not more than three feet high. Then he said: “I was under a Druidic spell, to be a blackbird till I should get three bites of fat from the entrails of Fin MacCumhail. I have followed you everywhere; have watched you in battle and hunt, on sea and land, but never have I been able to get the chance till this day. Now I have it, I have also the power to make you well again.”He put Fin’s entrails into their proper place, rubbed him with an ointment that he had, and Fin was well as ever.The little man, who said his name was Ridiri na lan tur (Knight of the Full Axe) had a small axe, his only weapon. As they floated along he said to Fin: “I wish to show you some strange things, such as you have never seen in Erin. We are near a country where the king’s daughter is to be married to-night. We will prevent the ceremony.”“Oh no,” said Fin, “I would rather go to my own home.”“Never mind,” said the little man, “nothing can harm you in my company; come with me. This is a wonderful king, and he has a wonderful daughter. It’s a strange country, and I want to show you the place. We’ll tell him that you are Fin MacCumhail, monarch of Erin; that we have been shipwrecked, and ask for a night’s shelter.”Fin consented at last, and with the Knight of the Full Axe landed, drew the boat on shore, and went to the king’s castle. There was noise and tumult; great crowds of people had come to do honor to the king’s daughter. Never before had such preparations been made in that kingdom.The Knight of the Full Axe knocked at the door, and asked admission for himself and Fin MacCumhail, monarch of Erin, shipwrecked on that shore. (The country was north of Erin, far out in the sea.)The attendants said: “No strangers may enter here, but there is a great house further on; go there and welcome.”The house to which they were directed was twenty-one miles long, ten miles wide, and about five miles distant from the castle; inhabited by the strangest men in the world, body-guards of the king, fed from the king’s house, and a terrible feeding it was,—human flesh. All strangers who came to the king’s castle were sent to that house, where the guards tore them to pieces and ate them up.These guards had to be fed well; if not they would devour the whole country.With Fin and the Knight of the Full Axe there went a messenger, who was careful not to go near the house; he pointed it out from a distance, and ran home.Fin and the knight knocked at the door. When it was opened all inside laughed; as they laughed, Fin could see their hearts and livers they were so glad. The Knight of the Full Axe asked, “Why do you laugh in this way?”“Oh,” answered they, “we laugh because you are so small you’ll not make a mouthful for one of us.”The guards barred the door and put a prop against it. Now the knight put a second prop against the door; the guards asked, “Why do you do that?”“I do it so none of you may escape me,” answered the knight. Then seizing two of the largest of the guards, one in each hand, he used them as clubs and killed the others with them. He ran the length of the house, striking right and left, till he walloped the life out of all that was in it, but the two. To them he said: “I spare you to clean out the house, and make the place fit for the monarch of Erin to spend the night in. Bring rushes, and make ready to receive Fin MacCumhail.”And from wherever they got them, they brought two baskets of rushes, each basket as big as a mountain, and spread litter on the ground two feet deep through the whole house; and then at the knight’s command they brought a pile of turf, and made a grand fire.Late in the evening the king’s attendants brought food, which they left near the house of the guards; these monsters were fed twice a day, morning and evening. To their great surprise the attendants saw the bodies of the dead giants piled up outside the house; they ran off quickly to tell the news.Now the Knight of the Full Axe sat by the fire. The two guards that he had spared tried to chat and be agreeable; but the knight snapped at them and said: “What company are you for the monarch of Erin?” Then he caught the two, squeezed the life out of them, and threw them on the pile outside.“Now,” said the knight to Fin, “there is no suitable food for you; I must get you something good to eat from the castle.”So off he started, reached the castle quickly, knocked at the door, and demanded the best of food, saying, “‘Tis fine treatment you are giving the monarch of Erin to-night!”They trembled at the voice of the little man, and without words or delay gave him the best they had in the castle. He carried it back and placed it before Fin. “Now,” said he, “they have given us no wine; we must have wine, and that of the best.”“Oh, we have no need of wine!” said Fin; but off went the knight.Again he demanded supplies at the castle. He took a hogshead of the best wine, threw it over his shoulder, and, as he hurried out, he struck a jamb off the door and swept it along with the hogshead.“Now,” said the knight, after they had eaten and drunk, “’tis too bad for the monarch of Erin to sleep on rushes; he should have the best bed in the land.”“Oh, trouble yourself no further,” said Fin; “better sleep on rushes than all this noise.”But the knight would listen to nothing; away he went to the castle, and shouted: “Give me the best bed in this place! I want it for Fin MacCumhail, the monarch of Erin.”They gave him the bed in a moment. With hurried steps he was back, and said to Fin: “Rest on this bed. Now I’ll stop the wedding of the princess; you may take her to Erin if you like.”“Oh, that would not be right! I am well as I am,” said Fin, who was getting in dread of the knight himself.“No, you’d better have the princess,” and off rushed the knight. He entered the castle. All were in terror; hither and thither they hurried, not knowing what to do. The Knight of the Full Axe seized the princess. “The monarch of Erin is a better man than your bridegroom,” said he; and clapping her under his arm, away he went. Not a man had the courage to stir.All was confusion and fear in the king’s castle. The princess was gone and no one could save her. All were in terrible dread, knowing what had been done at the long house.At last an old hag, one of the queen’s waiting-women, said: “I’ll go and see what has become of the princess. I’ll go on the chimney and look down.”Off ran the hag, and never rested till she was on the top of the chimney, sticking down her head to know what could she see. The chimney was wide, for the king’s guards had cooked all their food below on the fire. The Knight of the Full Axe was looking up at the time and saw the two eyes staring down at him.“Go on out of that,” cried he, flinging his axe; which stuck in the old woman’s forehead. Off she rushed to the castle. She had seen nothing of the princess; all she knew was that a little man was sitting by the fire warming himself, that he had thrown his axe at her, and it had stuck in her forehead.At daylight the knight spoke to Fin, who rose at once. “Now,” said he, “I have no strength left; all my strength is in the axe. While I had that I could do anything, now I can do nothing. We are in great danger; but there is such dread of us on the people here that we may mend matters yet. Do you put on the dress of a leech, get herbs and vials, and pretend you have great skill in healing. Go to the castle, and say you can take the axe out of the old hag’s head. No man there can do that without killing her; she will die the minute it is drawn. Get at her, seize the axe, pull it out, and with it you will have the greatest power on earth.”Fin went to the castle, and said: “I am a great doctor. I can take the axe out of the old woman’s head without trouble.”They took him to the hag, who was sitting upright in bed; her head was so sore she couldn’t lie down. He felt her head around the axe, sent the people away; when they were gone he took hold of the handle. With one snap he made two halves of the old woman’s head. Fin ran out with the axe, leaving the old hag dead behind him. He never stopped till he came where he had left the knight.Fin MacCumhail was now the strongest man on earth, and the knight the weakest. “You may keep the axe,” said the little man; “I shall not envy you, but will go with you and you will protect me.”“No,” said Fin, “it shall never be said that I took the axe from you, though I know its value and feel its power.”The knight was glad to get back his axe, and now the two set out for Erin. Fin kicked the boat three leagues from land, and with a bound they both came down in it, and floated on till they saw the coast of Erin. Then the little man said:“I must leave you now. Though of your kin, I cannot land in Erin. But if you need me at any time you have only to look over your right shoulder, call my name, and you will see me before you.”Now Fin sprang ashore; he had been absent a year and more, and no man knew where he was while gone. All thought him lost. Great was the gladness when Fin came home, and told the Fenians of Erin of what he had seen and what he had done.","['upon', 'time', 'farmer', 'cross', 'field', 'together', 'surprised', 'heavy',

2870,irish,The Legend of Knockgrafton,"There was once a poor man who lived in the fertile glen of Aherlow, at the foot of the gloomy Galtee mountains, and he had a great hump on his back: he looked just as if his body had been rolled up and placed upon his shoulders; and his head was pressed down with the weight so much, that his chin, when he. was sitting, used to rest upon his knees for support. The country people were rather shy of meeting him in any lonesome place, for though, poor creature, he was as harmless and as inoffensive as a new-born infant, yet his deformity was so great, that he scarcely appeared to be a human being, and some ill-minded persons had set strange stories about him afloat. He was said to have a great knowledge of herbs and charms; but certain it was that he had a mighty skillful hand in plaiting straw and rushes into bats and baskets., which was the way he made his livelihood.“Rising in clouded majesty, at length,Apparent Queen, unveil’d her peerless light,And o’er the dark her silver mantle threw.”Presently there rose a wild strain of unearthly melody upon the ear of little Lusmore; he listened, and he thought that he had never heard such ravishing music before. It was like the sound of many voices, each mingling and blending with the other so strangely, that they seemed to be one, though all singing different strains, and the words of the song were these: –Da Luan, Da Mort, Da Luan, Da Mort, Da Luan, Da Mort,when there would be a moment’s pause, and then the round of melody went on again.The fairies within Knockgrafton, for the song was a fairy melody, when they heard this addition to their tune, were so much delighted, that with instant resolve it was determined to bring the mortal among them, whose musical skill so far exceeded theirs, and little Lusmore was conveyed into their company with the eddying speed of a whirlwind.Glorious to behold was the sight that burst upon him as he came down through the moat, twirling round and round and round with the lightness of a straw, to the sweetest music that kept time to his moti6n. The greatest honour was then paid him, for he was put up above all the musicians, and he had servants ‘tending upon him, and every thing to his heart’s content, and a hearty welcome to all; and in short he was made as much of as if he had been the first man in the land.Presently Lusmore saw a great consultation going forward among the fairies, and, notwithstanding all their civility, he felt very much frightened, until one, stepping out from the rest, came up to him, and said, –“Lusmore! Lusmore!Doubt not, nor deplore,For the hump which you boreOn your back is no more! –Look down on the floor,And view it, Lusmore! ”When these words were said, poor little Lusmore felt himself so light, and so happy, that he thought he could have have bounded at one jump over the moon, like the cow in the history of the cat and the fiddle; and he saw, with inexpressible pleasure, his hump tumble down upon the ground from his shoulders. He then tried to lift up his head, and he did so with becoming caution, fearing that he might knock it against the ceiling of the grand hall, where he was; he looked round and round again with the greatest wonder and delight upon every thing, which appeared more and more beautiful; and, overpowered at beholding such a resplendent scene, his head grew dizzy, and his eyesight became dim. At last he fell into a sound sleep, and when he awoke, he found that it was broad daylight, the sun shining brightly, the birds singing sweet; and that he was lying just at the foot of the moat of Knockgrafton; with the cows and sheep grazing peaceably round about him. The first thing Lusmore did, after saying his prayers, was to put his band behind to feel for his hump, but no sign of one was there on his back, and he looked at himself with great pride, for he had now become a well-shaped dapper little fellow; and more than that, he found himself in a full suit of new clothes, which he concluded the fairies had made for him.Towards Cappagh he went, stepping out as lightly, and springing up at every step as if he had been all his life a dancing-master. Not a creature who met Lusmore knew him without his hump, and he had great work to persuade every one that he was the same man – in truth he was not, so far as outward appearance went.Of course it was not long before the story of Lusmore’s hump got about, and a great wonder was made of it. Through the country, for miles round, it was the talk of every one, high and low.One morning as Lusmore was sitting contented enough at his cabin-door, up came an old woman to him, and asked if he could direct her to Cappagh?“I need give you no directions, my good woman, said Lusmore, ” for this is Cappagh; and who do you want here?”“I have come, said the woman, “out of Decie’s country, in the county of Waterford, looking after one Lusmore, who, I have heard tell, had his hump taken off by the fairies: for there is a son of a gossip of mine has got a hump on him that will be his death; and may be, if he could use the same charm as Lusmore, the hump may be taken off him. And now I have told you the reason of my coming so far: ‘t is to find out about this charm, if I can.”Lusmore, who was ever a good-natured little fellow, told the woman all the particulars, how he had raised the tune for the fairies at Knockgrafton, how his hump had been removed from his shoulder., and how he had got a new suit of clothes into the bargain.The woman thanked him very much, and then went away quite happy and easy in her own mind. When she came back to her gossip’s house, in the county Waterford, she told her every thing that Lusmore had said, and they put the little hump-backed man, who was a peevish and cunning creature from his birth, upon a car, and took him all the way across the country. It was a long journey, but they did not care for that, so the hump was taken from off him; and they brought him, just at nightfall, and left him under the old moat of Knockgrafton.No sooner had the words passed his lips than he was taken up and whisked into the moat with prodigious force; and the fairies came crowding round about him with great anger, screeching and screaming, and roaring out, .” who spoiled our tune? who spoiled our tune ? ” and one stepped up to him above all the rest, and said –“Jack Madden! Jack Madden!Your words came so bad inThe tune we feel glad in; –This castle you’re bad in,That your life we may sadden :Here’s two bumps for Jack Madden!”And twenty of the strongest fairies brought Lusmore’s hump. and put it down upon poor Jack’s back, over his own, where it became fixed as firmly as if it was nailed on with twelvepenny nails, by the best carpenter that ever drove one. Out of their castle they then kicked him, and in the morning when Jack Madden’s mother and her gossip came to look after their little man, they found him half dead, lying at the foot of the moat, with the other hump upon his back. Well to be sure, how they did look at each other! but they were afraid to say any thing, lest a hump might be put upon their own shoulders: home they brought the unlucky Jack Madden with them, as downcast in their hearts and their looks as ever two gossips were; and what through the weight of his other bump, and the long journey, he died soon after, leaving, they say, his heavy curse to any one who would go to listen to fairy tunes again.","['countryman', 'little', 'puppy', 'come', 'parlour', 'enjoy', 'pick', 'bread-crumbs', 'table', 'mistress', 'visit', 'little', 'mistress', 'know',

2871,irish,The Weaver's Son and the Magic of the White Hill,"There was once a weaver in Erin who lived at the edge of a wood; and on a time when he had nothing to burn, he went out with his daughter to get fagots for the fire.They gathered two bundles, and were ready to carry them home, when who should come along but a splendid-looking stranger on horseback. And he said to the weaver: “My good man, will you give me that girl of yours?”“Indeed then I will not,” said the weaver.“I’ll give you her weight in gold,” said the stranger, and he put out the gold there on the ground.So the weaver went home with the gold and without the daughter. He buried the gold in the garden, without letting his wife know what he had done. When she asked, “Where is our daughter?” the weaver said: “I sent her on an errand to a neighbor’s house for things that I want.”Night came, but no sight of the girl. The next time he went for fagots, the weaver took his second daughter to the wood; and when they had two bundles gathered, and were ready to go home, a second stranger came on horseback, much finer than the first, and asked the weaver would he give him his daughter.“I will not,” said the weaver.“Well,” said the stranger, “I’ll give you her weight in silver if you’ll let her go with me;” and he put the silver down before him.The weaver carried home the silver and buried it in the garden with the gold, and the daughter went away with the man on horseback.When he went again to the wood, the weaver took his third daughter with him; and when they were ready to go home, a third man came on horseback, gave the weight of the third daughter in copper, and took her away. The weaver buried the copper with the gold and silver.Now, the wife was lamenting and moaning night and day for her three daughters, and gave the weaver no rest till he told the whole story.Now, a son was born to them; and when the boy grew up and was going to school, he heard how his three sisters had been carried away for their weight in gold and silver and copper; and every day when he came home he saw how his mother was lamenting and wandering outside in grief through the fields and pits and ditches, so he asked her what trouble was on her; but she wouldn’t tell him a word.At last he came home crying from school one day, and said: “I’ll not sleep three nights in one house till I find my three sisters.” Then he said to his mother: “Make me three loaves of bread, mother, for I am going on a journey.”Next day he asked had she the bread ready. She said she had, and she was crying bitterly all the time. “I’m going to leave you now, mother,” said he; “and I’ll come back when I have found my three sisters.”He went away, and walked on till he was tired and hungry; and then he sat down to eat the bread that his mother had given him, when a red-haired man came up and asked him for something to eat. “Sit down here,” said the boy. He sat down, and the two ate till there was not a crumb of the bread left.The boy told of the journey he was on; then the red-haired man said: “There may not be much use in your going, but here are three things that’ll serve you,—the sword of sharpness, the cloth of plenty, and the cloak of darkness. No man can kill you while that sword is in your hand; and whenever you are hungry or dry, all you have to do is to spread the cloth and ask for what you’d like to eat or drink, and it will be there before you. When you put on the cloak, there won’t be a man or a woman or a living thing in the world that’ll see you, and you’ll go to whatever place you have set your mind on quicker than any wind.”The red-haired man went his way, and the boy travelled on. Before evening a great shower came, and he ran for shelter to a large oak-tree. When he got near the tree his foot slipped, the ground opened, and down he went through the earth till he came to another country. When he was in the other country he put on the cloak of darkness and went ahead like a blast of wind, and never stopped till he saw a castle in the distance; and soon he was there. But he found nine gates closed before him, and no way to go through. It was written inside the cloak of darkness that his eldest sister lived in that castle.He was not long at the gate looking in when a girl came to him and said, “Go on out of that; if you don’t, you’ll be killed.”“Do you go in,” said he to the girl, “and tell my sister, the woman of this castle, to come out to me.” The girl ran in; out came the sister, and asked: “Why are you here, and what did you come for?”“I have come to this country to find my three sisters, who were given away by my father for their weight in gold, silver, and copper; and you are my eldest sister.”She knew from what he said that he was her brother, so she opened the gates and brought him in, saying: “Don’t wonder at anything you see in this castle. My husband is enchanted. I see him only at night. He goes off every morning, stays away all day, and comes home in the evening.”The sun went down; and while they were talking, the husband rushed in, and the noise of him was terrible. He came in the form of a ram, ran up stairs, and soon after came down a man.“Who is this that’s with you?” asked he of the wife.“Oh! that’s my brother, who has come from Erin to see me,” said she.Next morning, when the man of the castle was going off in the form of a ram, he turned to the boy and asked, “Will you stay a few days in my castle? You are welcome.”“Nothing would please me better,” said the boy; “but I have made a vow never to sleep three nights in one house till I have found my three sisters.”“Well,” said the ram, “since you must go, here is something for you.” And pulling out a bit of his own wool, he gave it to the boy, saying: “Keep this; and whenever a trouble is on you, take it out, and call on what rams are in the world to help you.” Away went the ram. The boy took farewell of his sister, put on the cloak of darkness, and disappeared. He travelled till hungry and tired, then he sat down, took off the cloak of darkness, spread the cloth of plenty, and asked for meat and drink. After he had eaten and drunk his fill, he took up the cloth, put on the cloak of darkness, and went ahead, passing every wind that was before him, and leaving every wind that was behind.About an hour before sunset he saw the castle in which his second sister lived. When he reached the gate, a girl came out to him and said: “Go away from that gate, or you’ll be killed.”“I’ll not leave this till my sister who lives in the castle comes out and speaks to me.”The girl ran in, and out came the sister. When she heard his story and his father’s name, she knew that he was her brother, and said: “Come into the castle, but think nothing of what you’ll see or hear. I don’t see my husband from morning till night. He goes and comes in a strange form, but he is a man at night.”About sunset there was a terrible noise, and in rushed the man of the castle in the form of a tremendous salmon. He went flapping upstairs; but he wasn’t long there till he came down a fine-looking man.“Who is that with you?” asked he of the wife. “I thought you would let no one into the castle while I was gone.”“Oh! this is my brother, who has come to see me,” said she.“If he’s your brother, he’s welcome,” said the man.They supped, and then slept till morning. When the man of the castle was going out again, in the form of a great salmon, he turned to the boy and said: “You’d better stay here with us a while.”“I cannot,” said the boy. “I made a vow never to sleep three nights in one house till I had seen my three sisters. I must go on now and find my third sister.”The salmon then took off a piece of his fin and gave it to the boy, saying: “If any difficulty meets you, or trouble comes on you, call on what salmons are in the sea to come and help you.”They parted. The boy put on his cloak of darkness, and away he went, more swiftly than any wind. He never stopped till he was hungry and thirsty. Then he sat down, took off his cloak of darkness, spread the cloth of plenty, and ate his fill; when he had eaten, he went on again till near sundown, when he saw the castle where his third sister lived. All three castles were near the sea. Neither sister knew what place she was in, and neither knew where the other two were living.The third sister took her brother in just as the first and second had done, telling him not to wonder at anything he saw.They were not long inside when a roaring noise was heard, and in came the greatest eagle that ever was seen. The eagle hurried upstairs, and soon came down a man.“Who is that stranger there with you?” asked he of the wife. (He, as well as the ram and salmon, knew the boy; he only wanted to try his wife.)“This is my brother, who has come to see me.”They all took supper and slept that night. When the eagle was going away in the morning, he pulled a feather out of his wing, and said to the boy: “Keep this; it may serve you. If you are ever in straits and want help, call on what eagles are in the world, and they’ll come to you.”There was no hurry now, for the third sister was found; and the boy went upstairs with her to examine the country all around, and to look at the sea. Soon he saw a great white hill, and on the top of the hill a castle.“In that castle on the white hill beyond,” said the sister, “lives a giant, who stole from her home the most beautiful young woman in the world. From all parts the greatest heroes and champions and kings’ sons are coming to take her away from the giant and marry her. There is not a man of them all who is able to conquer the giant and free the young woman; but the giant conquers them, cuts their heads off, and then eats their flesh. When he has picked the bones clean, he throws them out; and the whole place around the castle is white with the bones of the men that the giant has eaten.”“I must go,” said the boy, “to that castle to know can I kill the giant and bring away the young woman.”So he took leave of his sister, put on the cloak of darkness, took his sword with him, and was soon inside the castle. The giant was fighting with champions outside. When the boy saw the young woman he took off the cloak of darkness and spoke to her.“Oh!” said she, “what can you do against the giant? No man has ever come to this castle without losing his life. The giant kills every man; and no one has ever come here so big that the giant did not eat him at one meal.”“And is there no way to kill him?” asked the boy.“I think not,” said she.“Well, if you’ll give me something to eat, I’ll stay here; and when the giant comes in, I’ll do my best to kill him. But don’t let on that I am here.”Then he put on the cloak of darkness, and no one could see him. When the giant came in, he had the bodies of two men on his back. He threw down the bodies and told the young woman to get them ready for his dinner. Then he snuffed around, and said: “There’s some one here; I smell the blood of an Erineach.”“I don’t think you do,” said the young woman; “I can’t see any one.”“Neither can I,” said the giant; “but I smell a man.”With that the boy drew his sword; and when the giant was struck, he ran in the direction of the blow to give one back; then he was struck on the other side.They were at one another this way, the giant and the boy with the cloak of darkness on him, till the giant had fifty wounds, and was covered with blood. Every minute he was getting a slash of a sword, but never could give one back. At last he called out: “Whoever you are, wait till to-morrow, and I’ll face you then.”So the fighting stopped; and the young woman began to cry and lament as if her heart would break when she saw the state the giant was in. “Oh! you’ll be with me no longer; you’ll be killed now: what can I do alone without you?” and she tried to please him, and washed his wounds.“Don’t be afraid,” said the giant; “this one, whoever he is, will not kill me, for there is no man in the world that can kill me.” Then the giant went to bed, and was well in the morning.Next day the giant and the boy began in the middle of the forenoon, and fought till the middle of the afternoon. The giant was covered with wounds, and he had not given one blow to the boy, and could not see him, for he was always in his cloak of darkness. So the giant had to ask for rest till next morning.While the young woman was washing and dressing the wounds of the giant she cried and lamented all the time, saying: “What’ll become of me now? I’m afraid you’ll be killed this time; and how can I live here without you?”“Have no fear for me,” said the giant; “I’ll put your mind at rest. In the bottom of the sea is a chest locked and bound, in that chest is a duck, in the duck an egg; and I never can be killed unless some one gets the egg from the duck in the chest at the bottom of the sea, and rubs it on the mole that is under my right breast.”While the giant was telling this to the woman to put her mind at rest, who should be listening to the story but the boy in the cloak of darkness. The minute he heard of the chest in the sea, he thought of the salmons. So off he hurried to the seashore, which was not far away. Then he took out the fin that his eldest sister’s husband had given him, and called on what salmons were in the sea to bring up the chest with the duck inside, and put it out on the beach before him.He had not long to wait till he saw nothing but salmon,—the whole sea was covered with them, moving to land; and they put the chest out on the beach before him.But the chest was locked and strong; how could he open it? He thought of the rams; and taking out the lock of wool, said: “I want what rams are in the world to come and break open this chest!”That minute the rams of the world were running to the seashore, each with a terrible pair of horns on him; and soon they battered the chest to splinters. Out flew the duck, and away she went over the sea.The boy took out the feather, and said: “I want what eagles are in the world to get me the egg from that duck.”That minute the duck was surrounded by the eagles of the world, and the egg was soon brought to the boy. He put the feather, the wool, and the fin in his pocket, put on the cloak of darkness, and went to the castle on the white hill, and told the young woman, when she was dressing the wounds of the giant again, to raise up his arm.Next day they fought till the middle of the afternoon. The giant was almost cut to pieces, and called for a cessation.The young woman hurried to dress the wounds, and he said: “I see you would help me if you could: you are not able. But never fear, I shall not be killed.” Then she raised his arm to wash away the blood, and the boy, who was there in his cloak of darkness, struck the mole with the egg. The giant died that minute.The boy took the young woman to the castle of his third sister. Next day he went back for the treasures of the giant, and there was more gold in the castle than one horse could draw.They spent nine days in the castle of the eagle with the third sister. Then the boy gave back the feather, and the two went on till they came to the castle of the salmon, where they spent nine more days with the second sister; and he gave back the fin.When they came to the castle of the ram, they spent fifteen days with the first sister, and had great feasting and enjoyment. Then the boy gave back the lock of wool to the ram, and taking farewell of his sister and her husband, set out for home with the young woman of the white castle, who was now his wife, bringing presents from the three daughters to their father and mother.At last they reached the opening near the tree, came up through the ground, and went on to where he met the red-haired man. Then he spread the cloth of plenty, asked for every good meat and drink, and called the red-haired man. He came. The three sat down, ate and drank with enjoyment.When they had finished, the boy gave back to the red-haired man the cloak of darkness, the sword of sharpness, and the cloth of plenty, and thanked him.“You were kind to me,” said the red-haired man; “you gave me of your bread when I asked for it, and told me where you were going. I took pity on you; for I knew you never could get what you wanted unless I helped you. I am the brother of the eagle, the salmon, and the ram.”They parted. The boy went home, built a castle with the treasure of the giant, and lived happily with his parents and wife.","['outa', 'dispose', 'nightly', 'held', 'crooked', 'hand', 'towards', 'cheerful',

2875,irish,The Plaisham,"Nancy and Shamus were man and wife, and they lived all alone together for forty years; but at length a good-for-nothing streel of a fellow named Rory, who lived close by, thought what a fine thing it would be if Shamus would die, and he could marry Nancy, and get the house, farm, and all the stock. So he up and said to Nancy:“What a pity it is for such a fine-looking woman as you to be bothered with that ould, complainin’, good-for-nothing crony of a man that’s as full of pains and aches as an egg’s full of meat. If you were free of him the morrow, the finest and handsomest young man in the parish would be proud to have you for a wife.”At first Nancy used to laugh at this; but at last, when he kept on at it, it began to prey on Nancy’s mind, and she said to young Rory one day: “I don’t believe a word, of what you say. Who would take me if Shamus was buried the morra?”“Why,” says Rory, “you’d have the pick of the parish. I’d take you myself.”“Is that true?” says Nancy.“I pledge you my word,” says Rory, “I would.”“Oh, well, even if you would yourself,” says Nancy, “Shamus won’t be buried to-morrow, or maybe, God help me, for ten years to come yet.”“You’ve all that in your own hands,” says Rory.“How’s that?” says Nancy.“Why, you can kill him off,” says Rory.“I wouldn’t have the ould crature’s blood on my head,” says Nancy.“Neither you need,” says Rory.And then he sat down and began to tell Nancy how she could do away with Shamus and still not have his blood on her head.Now there was a prince called Connal, who lived in a wee sod house close by Nancy and Shamus, but whose fathers before him, ere their money was wasted, used to live in a grand castle. So, next day, over Nancy goes to this prince, and to him says: “Why, Prince Connal, isn’t it a shame to see the likes of you livin’ in the likes of that house?”“I know it is,” said he, “but I cannot do any better.”“Botheration,” says Nancy, “you easily can.”“I wish you would tell me how,” says Prince Connal.“Why,” says Nancy, “there’s my Shamus has little or nothing to do, an’ why don’t you make him build you a castle?”“Ah,” says the prince, laughing, “sure, Shamus couldn’t build me a castle.”Says Nancy: “You don’t know Shamus, for there’s not a thing in the wide world he couldn’t do if he likes to; but he’s that lazy, that if you don’t break every bone in his body to make him do it, he won’t do it.”“Is that so?” says Prince Connal.“That’s so,” says Nancy. “So if you order Shamus to build you a castle an’ have it up in three weeks, or that you’ll take his life if he doesn’t, you’ll soon have a grand castle to live in,” says she.“Well, if that’s so,” says Prince Connal, “I’ll not be long wanting a castle.”So on the very next morning, over he steps to Shamus’s, calls Shamus out, and takes him with him to the place he had marked out for the site of his castle, and shows it to Shamus, and tells him he wants him to have a grand castle built and finished on that spot in three weeks’ time.“But,” says Shamus, says he, “I never built a castle in my life. I know nothing about it, an’ I couldn’t have you a castle there in thirty- three years, let alone three weeks.”“O!” says the prince, says he, “I’m toul’ there’s no man in Ireland can build a castle better nor faster than you, if you only like to; and if you haven’t that castle built on that ground in three weeks,” says he, “I’ll have your life. So now choose for yourself.” And he walked away, and left Shamus standing there.When Shamus heard this, he was a down-hearted man, for he knew that Prince Connal was a man of his word and would not stop at taking any man’s life any more than he would from putting the breath out of a beetle. So down he sits and begins to cry; and while Shamus was crying there, up to him comes a Wee Red Man, and says to Shamus: “What are you crying about?”“Ah, my poor man,” says Shamus, says he, “don’t be asking me, for there’s no use in telling you, you could do nothing to help me.”“You don’t know that,” says the Wee Red Man, says he. “It’s no harm to tell me anyhow.”So Shamus, to relieve his mind, ups and tells the Wee Red Man what Prince Connal had threatened to do to him if he had not a grand castle finished on that spot in three weeks.Says the little man, says he: “Go to the Fairies’ Glen at moonrise the night, and under the rockin’ stone at the head of the glen you’ll find a white rod. Take that rod with you, and mark out the plan of the castle on this ground with it; then go back and leave the rod where you got it, and by the time you get back again your castle will be finished.”At moonrise that night Shamus, as you may be well assured, was at the rockin’ stone at the head of the Glen of the Fairies, and from under it he got a little white rod. He went to the hill where the Prince’s castle was to be built, and with the point of the rod he marked out the plan of the castle, and then he went back and left the rod where he got it.The next morning, when Prince Connal got up out of bed and went out of his little sod hut to take the air, his eyes were opened, I tell you, to see the magnificent castle that was standing finished and with the coping-stones on it on the hill above. He lost no time till he went over to thank Shamus for building him such a beautiful castle; and when Nancy heard that the castle was finished, it was she that was the angry woman.She went out and looked at the castle, and she wondered and wondered, too, but she said nothing. She had a long chat with Rory that day again, and from Rory she went off to Prince Connal, and says she: “Now, didn’t I tell you right well what Shamus could do?”“I see you did,” says Prince Connal, “and it is very thankful to you I am. I’m contented now for life,” says he, “and I’ll never forget yourself and Shamus.”“Contented!” says she; “why, that place isn’t half finished yet.”“How’s that?” says Prince Connal.“Why,” says she, “you need a beautiful river flowing past that castle, with lovely trees, and birds singing in the branches, and you should have the ocean roaring up beside it.”“But still,” says Prince Connal, says he, “one can’t have everything. This is a hundred miles from a river and a hundred miles from an ocean, and no trees ever grew on this hill, nor ever could grow on it, and no bird ever sang on it for the last three hundred years.”“Then all the more reason,” says she, “why you should have all them things.”“But I can’t have them,” says Prince Connal.“Can’t you ? “says she. “Yes, you can. If you promise to have Shamus’s life unless he has you all those things by your castle in three days, you’ll soon have all you want,” says Nancy.“Well, well, that’s wonderful,” says Prince Connal, says he, “and I’ll do it.”So he sets out, and goes to Shamus’s house, and calls Shamus out to him to tell him that his castle was very bare-looking without something about it. Says he: “Shamus, I want you to put a beautiful river flowing past it, with plenty of trees and bushes along the banks, and also birds singing in them; and I want you to have the ocean roaring up by it also.”“But, Prince Connal,” says Shamus, says he, “you know very well that I couldn’t get you them things.”“Right well I know you can,” says Prince Connal, “and I’ll give you three days to have all them things done; and if you haven’t them done at the end of three days, then I’ll have your life.” And away goes Prince Connal.Poor Shamus, he sat down and began to cry at this, because he knew that he could not do one of these things. And as he was crying and crying he heard a voice in his ear, and looking up he saw the Wee Red Man.“Shamus, Shamus,” says he, “what’s the matter with you?”“O,” says Shamus, says he, “there’s no use in telling you what’s the matter with me this time. Although you helped me before, there’s not a man in all the world could do what I’ve got to do now.”“Well, anyhow,” says the Wee Red Man, “if I can’t do you any good, I’ll do you no harm.”So Shamus, to relieve his mind, ups and tells the Wee Red Man what’s the matter with him.“Shamus,” says the Wee Red Man, says he, “I’ll tell you what you’ll do. When the moon’s rising to-night, be at the head of the Glen of the Fairies, and at the spring well there you’ll find a cup and a leaf and a feather. Take the leaf and the feather with you, and a cup of water, and go back to the castle. Throw the water from you as far as you can throw it, and then blow the leaf off your right hand, and the feather off your left hand, and see what you’ll see.”Shamus promised to do this. And when the moon rose that night, Shamus was at the spring well of the Glen of the Fairies, and he found there a cup, a leaf, and a feather. He lifted a cup of water and took it with him, and the leaf and the feather, and started for the castle. When he came there, he pitched the cup of water from him as far as he could pitch it, and at once the ocean, that was a hundred miles away, came roaring up beside the castle, and a beautiful river that had been flowing a hundred miles on the other side of the castle came flowing down past it into the ocean. Then he blew the leaf off his right hand, and all sorts of lovely trees and bushes sprang up along the river banks. Then he blew the feather off his left hand, and the trees and the bushes were filled with all sorts and varieties of lovely singing birds, that made the most beautiful music he ever had heard.And maybe that was not a surprise to Prince Connal when he got up in the morning and went out. Off he tramped to Shamus’s to thank Shamus and Nancy, and when Nancy heard this she was the angry woman.That day she had another long confab with Rory, and from him she went off again to Prince Connal, and asked him how he liked his castle and all its surroundings.He said he was a pleased and proud man, that he was thankful to her and her man, Shamus, and that he would never forget it to them the longest day of his life.“O, but,” says she, “you’re not content. This night you’ll have a great gathering of princes and lords and gentlemen feasting in your castle, and you’ll surely want something to amuse them with. You must get a plaisham.”“What’s a plaisham? “said Prince Connal.“O,” says Nancy, “it’s the most wonderful and most amusing thing in the world; it will keep your guests in good humor for nine days and nine nights after they have seen it.”“Well,” says Prince Connal, “that must be a fine thing entirely, and I’m sure I would be mighty anxious to have it. But,” says he, “where would I get it or how would I get it?”“Well,” says Nancy, “that’s easy. If you order Shamus to bring a plaisham to your castle by supper time this night, and promise to have his life if he hasn’t it there, he’ll soon get it for you.”“Well, if that’s so,” says Prince Connal, “I’ll not be long wanting a plaisham.”So home went Nancy rejoicing this time, for she said to herself that poor old Shamus would not be long living now, because there was no such thing known in the whole wide world as a plaisham; and though Shamus might build castles, and bring oceans and rivers and trees and birds to them, all in one night, he could not get a thing that did not exist and was only invented by Rory.Well, off to Shamus went Prince Connal without much loss of time, and called Shamus out of his little cabin. He told him he was heartily well pleased with all he had done for him. “But there’s one thing more I want you to do, Shamus, and then I’ll be content,” says he. “This night I give a grand supper to the lords, ladies, and gentry of the country, and I want something to amuse them with; so at supper time you must bring me a plaisham.”“A plaisham! What’s that?” says Shamus.“I don’t know,” says Prince Connal.“No more do I,” says Shamus, “an’ how do you expect me to fetch it to you then?”“Well,” says Prince Connal, says he, “this is all there is to be said about it — if you haven’t a plaisham at my castle door at supper time the night, you’ll be a dead man.”“O, O,” says Shamus, says he, and sat down on the ditch and began to cry, while Prince Connal went off home.“Shamus, Shamus,” says a voice in his ears, “what are you cryin’ about now?”Poor Shamus lifted his head and looked around, and there beside him stood the Wee Red Man.“O!” says Shamus, says he, “don’t mind asking me,” he says, “for it’s no use in telling you what’s the matter with me now. You may build a castle for me,” says he, “and you may bring oceans and rivers to it, and trees and birds; but you couldn’t do anything to help me now.”“How do you know that?” said the Wee Red Man.“O, I know it well,” says Shamus, says he, you couldn’t give me the thing that never was an’ never will be!”“Well,” says the Wee Red Man, says he, “tell me what it is anyhow. If I can’t do you any good, sure I can’t do you any harm.”So, to relieve his mind, Shamus ups and tells him that Prince Connal had ordered him, within twenty-four hours, to have at his castle door a plaisham. “But,” says Shamus, says he, “there never was such a thing as that.”Shamus thanked the Wee Red Man, and that night he went to the head of the Glen of the Fairies, and sure enough, he found the ring hanging from one of the branches of the sciog bush. He took it with him, and started for home. When he looked in through the kitchen window, there he saw Nancy and Rory sitting over the fire, chatting and confabbing about how they would get rid of him; but he said nothing, only went into the byre. He put the ring into the brannet cow’s nose, and as soon as the ring went into it, the cow began to kick and rear and create a great tendherary of a noise entirely. Then Shamus got in under some hay in the corner.It was no time at all until Nancy was out to find what was wrong with the brannet cow. She struck the cow with her fist to quiet her, but when she hit her, her fist stuck to the cow, and she could not get away.Rory had come running out after Nancy to help her, and Nancy called: “Rory, Rory, pull me away from the cow.”Rory got hold of her to pull her away, but as he did so his hands stuck to Nancy, and he could not get away himself.Up then jumped Shamus from under the hay in the corner. “Hup, Hup!” says Shamus, says he, “drive on the plaisham.”And out of the byre starts the cow with Nancy stuck to her, and Rory stuck to that, and heads toward the castle, with the cow rearing and rowting, and Nancy and Rory yelling and bawling. They made a terrible din entirely, and roused the whole countryside, who flocked out to see what was the matter.Down past Rory’s house the cow went, and Rory’s mother, seeing him sticking to Nancy, ran out to pull him away; but when she laid her hand on Rory, she stuck to him; and “Hup, Hup!” says Shamus, says he, “drive on the plaisham.So on they went. And Rory’s father ran after them to pull the mother away; but when he laid his hands on the mother, he stuck to her; and “Hup, Hup!” says Shamus, “drive on the plaisham.”On they went; and a tailor came flying out of his house with his lap-board in his hand. He struck the string of them with the lap-board, the lap-board stuck to the last man, and the tailor stuck to it; and “Hup, Hup!” says Shamus, says he, “drive on the plaisham.”Then they passed a cobbler’s. He ran out with his heel-stick, and struck the tailor; but the heel-stick stuck to the tailor, and the cobbler stuck to the heel-stick; and “Hup, Hup!” says Shamus, says he, “drive on the plaisham.”Then on they went, and they next passed a blacksmith’s forge. The blacksmith ran out, and struck the cobbler with his sledge. The sledge stuck to the cobbler, and the blacksmith stuck to the sledge; and “Hup, Hup!” says Shamus, says he, “drive on the plaisham.”When they came near the castle, they passed a great gentleman’s house entirely, and the gentleman came running out, and got hold of the blacksmith to pull him away; but the gentleman stuck to the blacksmith, and could not get away himself; and “Hup, Hup!” says Shamus, says he, “drive on the plaisham.”The gentleman’s wife, seeing him stuck, ran after her man to pull him away; but the wife stuck to the gentleman; and “Hup, Hup!” says Shamus, says he, “drive on the plaisham.”Then their children ran after them to pull the mother away, and they stuck to the mother; and “Hup, Hup!” says Shamus, says he, “drive on the plaisham.”Then the butler ran to get hold of the children, and he stuck to them; and the footman ran to get hold of the butler, and stuck to him; and the cook ran to get hold of the footman, and stuck to him; and the servants all ran to get hold of the cook, and they stuck to her; and “Hup, Hup!” says Shamus, says he, “drive on the plaisham.” And on they went; and when they came up to the castle, the plaisham was a mile long, and the yelling and bawling and noise that they made could be heard anywhere within the four seas of Ireland. The racket was so terrible that Prince Connal and all his guests and all his servants and all in his house came running to the windows to see what was the matter, at all, at all; and when Prince Connal saw what was coming to his house, and heard the racket they were raising, he yelled to his Prime Minister to go and drive them off with a whip.The Prime Minister ran meeting them, and took the whip to them; but the whip stuck to them, and he stuck to the whip; and “Hup, Hup!” says Shamus, says he, “drive on the plaisham.”Then Prince Connal ordered out all his other ministers and all of his servants to head it off and turn it away from his castle; but every one of the servants that got hold of it stuck to it; and “Hup, Hup!”says Shamus, says he, “drive on the plaisham.”And the plaisham moved on still for the castle. Then Prince Connal himself, with all his guests, ran out to turn it away ; but when Prince Connal laid hands on the plaisham, he stuck to it; and when his guest laid hands on him, they stuck one by one to him; and “Hup, Hup!” says Shamus, says he, “drive on the plaisham.”And with all the racket and all the noise of the ranting, roaring, rearing, and rawting, in through the castle hall-door drove the plaisham, through and through and out at the other side. The castle itself fell down and disappeared, the bone ring rolled away from the cow’s nose, and the plaisham all at once broke up, and when Prince Connal looked around, there was no castle at all, only the sod hut, and he went into it a sorry man.And all the others slunk off home, right headily ashamed of themselves, for the whole world was laughing at them. Nancy, she went east; and Rory, he went west; and neither one of them was ever heard of more. As for Shamus, he went home to his own little cabin, and lived all alone, happy and contented, for the rest of his life, and may you and I do the same.","['great', 'prince', 'arthur', 'live',

2883,irish,The Story of the Pig-Trough,"In the beginning of the century, Hughes went as military substitute for a farmer’s son. He got £80, a watch, and a suit of clothes. His mother was loath to let him go, and when he joined his regiment, she followed him from Amlych to Pwlheli to try and buy him off. He would not hear of it. “Mother,” he said, “the whole of Anglesey would not keep me, I want to be off, and see the world.”The regiment was quartered in Edinboro’, and Hughes married the daughter of the burgess with whom he was billeted. Thence, leaving a small son, as hostage to the grandparents, they went to Ireland, and Hughes and his wife were billeted on a pork-butcher’s family in Dublin. One day, the mother of the pork-butcher, an old granny, told them she had seen the fairies.“Last night, as I was abed, I saw a bright, bright light come in, and afterwards a troop of little angels. They danced all over my bed, and they played and sang music—oh! the sweetest music ever I heard. I lay and watched them and listened. By-and-bye the light went out and the music stopped, and I saw them no more. I regretted the music very much. But directly after another smaller light appeared, and a tall dark man came up to my bed, and with something in his hand he tapped me on the temple; it felt like some one drawing a sharp pin across my temple then he went too. In the morning my pillow was covered with blood. I thought and thought, and then I knew I had moved the pig’s trough and must have put it in the fairies’ path and the fairies were angered, and the king of the fairies had punished me for it.” She moved the trough back to its old place the next day, and received no more visits from the wee folk.","['tall', 'young', 'woman', 'fairy', 'visit', 'come', 'keyhole', 'night', 'could', 'hear', 'dance', 'sing', 'room', 'morning', 'come', 'always', 'left', 'money', 'married', 'chose', 'tall', 'husband', 'like', 'fine', 'child', 'night', 'fair', 'side', 'hear', 'fairy', 'people', 'could', 'tell', 'fairy', 'come', 'make', 'noise', 'like', 'wind', 'whilst', 'wait', 'told', 'husband', 'fairy', 'leave', 'money', 'night', 'home', 'found', 'baby', 'right', 'next', 'morning', 'young', 'mother', 'found', 'child', 'change', 'night', 'little', 'baby', 'cradle', 'child', 'never', 'grow', 'fairy', 'change', 'child', 'spite']","['begin', 'century', 'hughes', 'military', 'substitute', 'farmer', 'watch', 'suit_clothes', 'mother', 'loath', 'join', 'regiment', 'follow', 'amlych', 'pwlheli', 'would', 'hear', 'mother', 'whole', 'anglesey', 'would', 'keep', 'want', 'world', 'regiment', 'quarter', 'edinboro', 'hughes', 'married', 'daughter', 'burgess', 'billet', 'thence', 'leave', 'small', 'hostage', 'grandparent', 'ireland', 'hughes', 'wife', 'billet', 'pork-butcher', 'family', 'dublin', 'mother', 'pork-butcher', 'granny', 'told', 'fairy', 'last', 'night', 'abed', 'bright', 'bright_light', 'come', 'afterwards', 'troop', 'little', 'angel', 'dance', 'played', 'sang', 'music', 'sweetest_music', 'ever', 'heard', 'watch', 'listen', 'by-and-bye', 'light', 'music', 'stop', 'regret', 'music', 'much', 'directly', 'another', 'small', 'light', 'appear', 'tall', 'dark', 'come', 'something', 'hand', 'tapped', 'temple', 'felt', 'like', 'draw', 'sharp', 'across', 'temple', 'morning', 'pillow', 'cover_blood', 'thought', 'thought', 'knew', 'move', 'trough', 'must', 'fairy', 'path', 'fairy', 'angered', 'king', 'fairy', 'punish', 'move', 'trough', 'back', 'place', 'next', 'receive', 'visit', 'folk']",celtic,sid2883
